Hebrew languageHebrew(Hebrew alphabet:עִבְרִית‎,ʿĪvrīt(help·info),IPA:[ivˈʁit]or[ʕivˈɾit];Samaritan script:ࠏࠁࠓࠉࠕ;Paleo-Hebrew script:𐤏𐤁𐤓‫𐤉𐤕) is aNorthwest Semitic languageof theAfroasiatic language family. Historically, it is regarded as one of the spoken languages of theIsraelitesand their longest-surviving descendants: theJudeansandSamaritans. It was largely preserved throughout history as the mainliturgical languageofJudaism(since theSecond Temple period) andSamaritanism. Hebrew is the onlyCanaanite languagestill spoken today, and serves as the only truly successful example of adead languagethat has beenrevived. It is also one of only two Northwest Semitic languages still in use, with the other beingAramaic.
[10][11]The earliest examples of writtenPaleo-Hebrewdate back to the 10th century BCE.
[12]Nearly all of theHebrew Bibleis written inBiblical Hebrew, with much of its present form in the dialect that scholars believe flourished around the 6th century BCE, during the time of theBabylonian captivity. For this reason, Hebrew has been referred to by Jews asLashon Hakodesh(לָשׁוֹן הַקֹּדֶשׁ‎‎,lit.
'the holy tongue' or 'the tongue [of] holiness') since ancient times. The language was not referred to by the nameHebrewin theBible, but asYehudit(transl.
'the language ofJudah') orSəpaṯ Kəna'an(transl.
'the language ofCanaan').
[2][note 1]Mishnah Gittin 9:8refers to the language asIvrit, meaning Hebrew; however,Mishnah Megillahrefers to the language asAshurit, meaningAssyrian, which is derived from the name ofthe alphabet used, in contrast toIvrit, meaning thePaleo-Hebrew alphabet.
[13]Hebrew ceased to be a regular spoken language sometime between 200 and 400 CE, declining in the aftermath of the unsuccessfulBar Kokhba revoltthat was carried out against theRoman Empireby the Jews ofJudaea.
[14][15][note 2]Aramaic and, to a lesser extent,Greekwere already in use as international languages, especially among societal elites and immigrants.
[17]Hebrew survived into themedieval periodas the language ofJewish liturgy,rabbinic literature,intra-Jewish commerceandJewish poetic literature. With the rise ofZionismin the 19th century, the Hebrew languageexperienced a full-scale revivalas a spoken and literary language, after which it became the main language of theYishuvinPalestineand subsequently thelingua francaof theState of Israelwith official status. According toEthnologue, Hebrew was spoken by five million people worldwide in 1998;[5]in 2013, it was spoken by over nine million people worldwide.
[18]After Israel, theUnited Stateshas the second-largest Hebrew-speaking population, with approximately 220,000 fluent speakers (seeIsraeli AmericansandJewish Americans).
[19]Modern Hebrewis theofficial languageof the State of Israel, while pre-revival forms of Hebrew are used for prayer or study in Jewish and Samaritan communities around the world today; the latter group utilizes theSamaritan dialectas their liturgical tongue. As a non-first language, it is studied mostly by non-Israeli Jews and students in Israel, byarchaeologistsandlinguistsspecializing in theMiddle Eastandits civilizations, and by theologians inChristianseminaries.
ContentsEtymology[edit]The modernEnglishword "Hebrew" is derived fromOld FrenchEbrau, viaLatinfrom theGreekἙβραῖος(hevraîos) andAramaic'ibrāy, all ultimately derived fromBiblical HebrewIvri(עברי‎), one of several names for theIsraelite(JewishandSamaritan) people (Hebrews). It is traditionally understood to be an adjective based on the name ofAbraham's ancestor,Eber, mentioned inGenesis 10:21. The name is believed to be based on theSemitic rootʕ-b-r(עבר‎) meaning "beyond", "other side", "across";[20]interpretations of the term "Hebrew" generally render its meaning as roughly "from the other side [of the river/desert]"—i.e., anexonymfor the inhabitants of the land ofIsrael and Judah, perhaps from the perspective ofMesopotamia,PhoeniciaorTransjordan(with the river referred to being perhaps theEuphrates,JordanorLitani; or maybe the northernArabian DesertbetweenBabyloniaandCanaan).
[21]Compare the wordHabiruor cognateAssyrianebru, of identical meaning.
[22]One of the earliest references to the language's name as "Ivrit" is found in the prologue to theBook of Ben Sira,[a][clarification needed]from the 2nd century BCE.
[23]The Hebrew Bible does not use the term "Hebrew" in reference to the language of theHebrew people;[24]its later historiography, in the Book of Kings, refers to it as ‏יְהוּדִית Yehudit 'Judahite (language)'.
[25]History[edit]Hebrew belongs to theCanaanite group of languages. Canaanite languages are a branch of theNorthwest Semiticfamily of languages.
[26]According to Avraham Ben-Yosef, Hebrew flourished as a spoken language in theKingdoms of IsraelandJudahduring the period from about 1200 to 586 BCE.
[27]Scholars debate the degree to which Hebrew was a spoken vernacular in ancient times following theBabylonian exilewhen the predominant international language in the region wasOld Aramaic.
Hebrew was extinct as a colloquial language byLate Antiquity, but it continued to be used as a literary language, especially in Spain, as the language of commerce between Jews of different native languages, and as the liturgical language of Judaism, evolving various dialects of literaryMedieval Hebrew, until itsrevival as a spoken languagein the late 19th century.
[28][29]Oldest Hebrew inscriptions[edit]In July 2008, Israeli archaeologistYossi Garfinkeldiscovered a ceramic shard atKhirbet Qeiyafathat he claimed may be the earliest Hebrew writing yet discovered, dating from around 3,000 years ago.
[30]Hebrew UniversityarchaeologistAmihai Mazarsaid that the inscription was "proto-Canaanite" but cautioned that "The differentiation between the scripts, and between the languages themselves in that period, remains unclear," and suggested that calling the text Hebrew might be going too far.
[31]TheGezer calendaralso dates back to the 10th century BCE at the beginning of theMonarchic period, the traditional time of the reign ofDavidandSolomon. Classified asArchaic Biblical Hebrew, the calendar presents a list of seasons and related agricultural activities. TheGezercalendar (named after the city in whose proximity it was found) is written in an old Semitic script, akin to thePhoenicianone that, through theGreeksandEtruscans, later became theRoman script. The Gezer calendar is written without any vowels, and it does not useconsonants to imply vowelseven in the places in which later Hebrew spelling requires them.
Numerous older tablets have been found in the region with similar scripts written in other Semitic languages, for example,Protosinaitic. It is believed that the original shapes of the script go back toEgyptian hieroglyphs, though the phonetic values are instead inspired by theacrophonicprinciple. The common ancestor of Hebrew and Phoenician is calledCanaanite, and was the first to use a Semitic alphabet distinct from that of Egyptian. One ancient document is the famousMoabite Stone, written in the Moabite dialect; theSiloam Inscription, found nearJerusalem, is an early example of Hebrew. Less ancient samples of Archaic Hebrew include theostracafound nearLachish, which describe events preceding the final capture of Jerusalem byNebuchadnezzarand the Babylonian captivity of 586 BCE.
Classical Hebrew[edit]Biblical Hebrew[edit]In its widest sense, Biblical Hebrew refers to the spoken language of ancient Israel flourishing between the 10th century BCE and the turn of the 4th centuryCE.
[32]It comprises several evolving and overlapping dialects. The phases of Classical Hebrew are often named after important literary works associated with them.
Early post-Biblical Hebrew[edit]Sometimes the above phases of spoken Classical Hebrew are simplified into "Biblical Hebrew" (including several dialects from the 10th century BCE to 2nd century BCE and extant in certain Dead Sea Scrolls) and "Mishnaic Hebrew" (including several dialects from the 3rd century BCE to the 3rd century CE and extant in certain other Dead Sea Scrolls).
[33]However, today most Hebrew linguists classify Dead Sea Scroll Hebrew as a set of dialects evolving out of Late Biblical Hebrew and into Mishnaic Hebrew, thus including elements from both but remaining distinct from either.
[34]By the start of the Byzantine Period in the 4th century CE, Classical Hebrew ceased as a regularly spoken language, roughly a century after the publication of the Mishnah, apparently declining since the aftermath of the catastrophicBar Kokhba revoltaround 135 CE.
Displacement by Aramaic[edit]In the early 6th century BCE, theNeo-Babylonian Empireconquered the ancientKingdom of Judah, destroying much ofJerusalemand exiling its population far to the East inBabylon. During theBabylonian captivity, manyIsraeliteslearned Aramaic, the closely related Semitic language of their captors. Thus for a significant period, theJewishelite became influenced by Aramaic.
[35]AfterCyrus the Greatconquered Babylon, he allowed the Jewish people to return from captivity.
[36][37]As a result,[improper synthesis?]a local version of Aramaic came to be spoken in Israel alongside Hebrew. By the beginning of theCommon Era, Aramaic was the primary colloquial language ofSamarian,BabylonianandGalileeanJews, and western and intellectual Jews spokeGreek,[citation needed]but a form of so-calledRabbinic Hebrewcontinued to be used as a vernacular in Judea until it was displaced by Aramaic, probably in the 3rd century CE. CertainSadducee,Pharisee,Scribe, Hermit, Zealot and Priest classes maintained an insistence on Hebrew, and all Jews maintained their identity with Hebrew songs and simple quotations from Hebrew texts.
[16][38][39]While there is no doubt that at a certain point, Hebrew was displaced as the everyday spoken language of most Jews, and that its chief successor in the Middle East was the closely related Aramaic language, thenGreek,[38][note 2]scholarly opinions on the exact dating of that shift have changed very much.
[15]In the first half of the 20th century, most scholars followedGeigerandDalmanin thinking that Aramaic became a spoken language in the land of Israel as early as the beginning of Israel'sHellenistic periodin the 4th century BCE, and that as a corollary Hebrew ceased to function as a spoken language around the same time.
Segal,Klausnerand Ben Yehuda are notable exceptions to this view. During the latter half of the 20th century, accumulating archaeological evidence and especially linguistic analysis of the Dead Sea Scrolls has disproven that view. The Dead Sea Scrolls, uncovered in 1946–1948 nearQumranrevealed ancient Jewish texts overwhelmingly in Hebrew, not Aramaic.
The Qumran scrolls indicate that Hebrew texts were readily understandable to the average Israelite, and that the language had evolved since Biblical times as spoken languages do.
[note 3]Recent scholarship recognizes that reports of Jews speaking in Aramaic indicate a multilingual society, not necessarily the primary language spoken. Alongside Aramaic, Hebrew co-existed within Israel as a spoken language.
[41]Most scholars now date the demise of Hebrew as a spoken language to the end of theRoman period, or about 200 CE.
[42]It continued on as a literary language down through theByzantine periodfrom the 4th century CE.
The exact roles of Aramaic and Hebrew remain hotly debated. A trilingual scenario has been proposed for the land of Israel. Hebrew functioned as the localmother tonguewith powerful ties to Israel's history, origins and golden age and as the language of Israel's religion; Aramaic functioned as the international language with the rest of the Middle East; and eventually Greek functioned as another international language with the eastern areas of the Roman Empire.
[citation needed]William Schniedewindargues that after waning in the Persian period, the religious importance of Hebrew grew in the Hellenistic and Roman periods, and cites epigraphical evidence that Hebrew survived as a vernacular language – though both its grammar and its writing system had been substantially influenced by Aramaic.
[43]According to another summary, Greek was the language of government, Hebrew the language of prayer, study and religious texts, and Aramaic was the language of legal contracts and trade.
[44]There was also a geographic pattern: according to Spolsky, by the beginning of the Common Era, "Judeo-Aramaicwas mainly used in Galilee in the north, Greek was concentrated in the former colonies and around governmental centers, and Hebrew monolingualism continued mainly in the southern villages of Judea."[38]In other words, "in terms of dialect geography, at the time of thetannaimPalestine could be divided into the Aramaic-speaking regions of Galilee and Samaria and a smaller area, Judaea, in whichRabbinic Hebrewwas used among the descendants of returning exiles."[16][39]In addition, it has been surmised thatKoine Greekwas the primary vehicle of communication in coastal cities and among the upper class ofJerusalem, while Aramaic was prevalent in the lower class of Jerusalem, but not in the surrounding countryside.
[44]After the suppression of theBar Kokhba revoltin the 2nd century CE, Judaeans were forced to disperse. Many relocated to Galilee, so most remaining native speakers of Hebrew at that last stage would have been found in the north.
[45]The ChristianNew Testamentcontains some Semitic place names and quotes.
[46]The language of such Semitic glosses (and in general the language spoken by Jews in scenes from the New Testament) is often referred to as "Hebrew" in the text,[47]although this term is often re-interpreted as referring to Aramaic instead[note 4][note 5]and is rendered accordingly in recent translations.
[49]Nonetheless, these glosses can be interpreted as Hebrew as well.
[50]It has been argued that Hebrew, rather than Aramaic or Koine Greek, lay behind the composition of theGospel of Matthew.
[51](See theHebrew Gospel hypothesisorLanguage of Jesusfor more details on Hebrew and Aramaic in the gospels.)Mishnah and Talmud[edit]The term "Mishnaic Hebrew" generally refers to the Hebrew dialects found in theTalmud, excepting quotations from the Hebrew Bible. The dialects organize into Mishnaic Hebrew (also calledTannaiticHebrew, Early Rabbinic Hebrew, orMishnaicHebrew I), which was aspoken language, andAmoraicHebrew (also called Late Rabbinic Hebrew or Mishnaic Hebrew II), which was aliterary language. The earlier section of the Talmud is theMishnahthat was published around 200 CE, although many of the stories take place much earlier, and was written in the earlier Mishnaic dialect. The dialect is also found in certain Dead Sea Scrolls. Mishnaic Hebrew is considered to be one of the dialects of Classical Hebrew that functioned as a living language in the land of Israel. A transitional form of the language occurs in the other works of Tannaitic literature dating from the century beginning with the completion of the Mishnah. These include thehalachicMidrashim(Sifra,Sifre,Mechiltaetc.) and the expanded collection of Mishnah-related material known as theTosefta. The Talmud contains excerpts from these works, as well as further Tannaitic material not attested elsewhere; the generic term for these passages isBaraitot. The dialect of all these works is very similar to Mishnaic Hebrew.
About a century after the publication of the Mishnah, Mishnaic Hebrew fell into disuse as a spoken language. The later section of the Talmud, theGemara, generally comments on the Mishnah and Baraitot in two forms of Aramaic. Nevertheless, Hebrew survived as a liturgical and literary language in the form of laterAmoraicHebrew, which sometimes occurs in the text of the Gemara.
Hebrew was always regarded as the language of Israel's religion, history and national pride, and after it faded as a spoken language, it continued to be used as alingua francaamong scholars and Jews traveling in foreign countries.
[52]After the 2nd century CE when theRoman Empireexiled most of the Jewish population of Jerusalem following theBar Kokhba revolt, they adapted to the societies in which they found themselves, yet letters, contracts, commerce, science, philosophy, medicine, poetry and laws continued to be written mostly in Hebrew, which adapted by borrowing and inventing terms.
Medieval Hebrew[edit]After the Talmud, various regional literary dialects ofMedieval Hebrewevolved. The most important isTiberian Hebrewor Masoretic Hebrew, a local dialect ofTiberiasinGalileethat became the standard for vocalizing theHebrew Bibleand thus still influences all other regional dialects of Hebrew. This Tiberian Hebrew from the 7th to 10th century CE is sometimes called "Biblical Hebrew" because it is used to pronounce the Hebrew Bible; however, properly it should be distinguished from the historical Biblical Hebrew of the 6th century BCE, whose original pronunciation must be reconstructed. Tiberian Hebrew incorporates the remarkable scholarship of theMasoretes(frommasoretmeaning "tradition"), who addedvowel pointsandgrammar pointsto the Hebrew letters to preserve much earlier features of Hebrew, for use in chanting the Hebrew Bible. The Masoretes inherited a biblical text whose letters were considered too sacred to be altered, so their markings were in the form of pointing in and around the letters. TheSyriac alphabet, precursor to theArabic alphabet, also developed vowel pointing systems around this time. TheAleppo Codex, a Hebrew Bible with the Masoretic pointing, was written in the 10th century, likely inTiberias, and survives to this day. It is perhaps the most important Hebrew manuscript in existence.
During theGolden age of Jewish culture in Spain, important work was done by grammarians in explaining the grammar and vocabulary of Biblical Hebrew; much of this was based on the work of thegrammariansofClassical Arabic. Important Hebrew grammarians wereJudah ben David Hayyuj,Jonah ibn Janah,Abraham ibn Ezra[53]and later (inProvence),David Kimhi. A great deal of poetry was written, by poets such asDunash ben Labrat,Solomon ibn Gabirol,Judah ha-Levi,Moses ibn EzraandAbraham ibn Ezra, in a "purified" Hebrew based on the work of these grammarians, and in Arabic quantitative or strophic meters. This literary Hebrew was later used by Italian Jewish poets.
[54]The need to express scientific and philosophical concepts fromClassical GreekandMedieval Arabicmotivated Medieval Hebrew to borrow terminology and grammar from these other languages, or to coin equivalent terms from existing Hebrew roots, giving rise to a distinct style of philosophical Hebrew. This is used in the translations made by theIbn Tibbonfamily. (Original Jewish philosophical works were usually written in Arabic.
[citation needed]) Another important influence wasMaimonides, who developed a simple style based onMishnaic Hebrewfor use in his law code, theMishneh Torah. Subsequent rabbinic literature is written in a blend between this style and the Aramaized Rabbinic Hebrew of the Talmud.
Hebrew persevered through the ages as the main language for written purposes by all Jewish communities around the world for a large range of uses—not only liturgy, but also poetry, philosophy, science and medicine, commerce, daily correspondence and contracts. There have been many deviations from this generalization such asBar Kokhba's letters to his lieutenants, which were mostly in Aramaic,[55]andMaimonides' writings, which were mostly inArabic;[56]but overall, Hebrew did not cease to be used for such purposes. For example, the first Middle East printing press, in Safed (modern Israel), produced a small number of books in Hebrew in 1577, which were then sold to the nearby Jewish world.
[57]This meant not only that well-educated Jews in all parts of the world could correspond in a mutually intelligible language, and that books and legal documents published or written in any part of the world could be read by Jews in all other parts, but that an educated Jew could travel and converse with Jews in distant places, just as priests and other educated Christians could converse in Latin. For example, RabbiAvraham Danzigwrote theChayei Adamin Hebrew, as opposed toYiddish, as a guide toHalachafor the "average17-year-old" (Ibid. Introduction 1). Similarly, theChofetz Chaim, RabbiYisrael Meir Kagan's purpose in writing theMishna Berurahwas to "produce a work that could be studied daily so that Jews might know the proper procedures to follow minute by minute". The work was nevertheless written in Talmudic Hebrew and Aramaic, since, "the ordinary Jew [of Eastern Europe] of a century ago, was fluent enough in this idiom to be able to follow the Mishna Berurah without any trouble."[58]Revival[edit]Hebrew has beenrevivedseveral times as a literary language, most significantly by theHaskalah(Enlightenment) movement of early and mid-19th-century Germany. In the early 19th century, a form of spoken Hebrew had emerged in the markets of Jerusalem between Jews of different linguistic backgrounds to communicate for commercial purposes. This Hebrew dialect was to a certain extent apidgin.
[59]Near the end of that century the Jewish activistEliezer Ben-Yehuda, owing to the ideology of thenational revival(שיבת ציון,Shivat Tziyon,laterZionism), began reviving Hebrew as a modern spoken language. Eventually, as a result of the local movement he created, but more significantly as a result of the new groups of immigrants known under the name of theSecond Aliyah, it replaced a score of languages spoken by Jews at that time. Those languages were Jewish dialects of local languages, includingJudaeo-Spanish(also called "Judezmo" and "Ladino"),Yiddish,Judeo-ArabicandBukhori(Tajiki), or local languages spoken in theJewish diasporasuch asRussian,PersianandArabic.
The major result of the literary work of the Hebrew intellectuals along the 19th century was a lexical modernization of Hebrew. New words and expressions were adapted asneologismsfrom the large corpus of Hebrew writings since the Hebrew Bible, or borrowed from Arabic (mainly by Eliezer Ben-Yehuda) and older Aramaic and Latin. Many new words were either borrowed from or coined after European languages, especially English, Russian, German, and French. Modern Hebrew became an official language in British-ruled Palestine in 1921 (along with English and Arabic), and then in 1948 became an official language of the newly declaredState of Israel. Hebrew is the most widely spoken language in Israel today.
In the Modern Period, from the 19th century onward, the literary Hebrew tradition revived as the spoken language of modern Israel, called variouslyIsraeli Hebrew,Modern Israeli Hebrew,Modern Hebrew,New Hebrew,Israeli Standard Hebrew,Standard Hebrewand so on. Israeli Hebrew exhibits some features ofSephardic Hebrewfrom its local Jerusalemite tradition but adapts it with numerous neologisms, borrowed terms (often technical) from European languages and adopted terms (often colloquial) from Arabic.
The literary and narrative use of Hebrew was revived beginning with the Haskalah movement. The first secular periodical in Hebrew,HaMe'assef(The Gatherer), was published bymaskiliminKönigsberg(today'sKaliningrad) from 1783 onwards.
[60]In the mid-19th century, publications of several Eastern European Hebrew-language newspapers (e.g.
Hamagid, founded inEłkin 1856) multiplied. Prominent poets wereHayim Nahman BialikandShaul Tchernichovsky; there were also novels written in the language.
Therevival of the Hebrew languageas amother tonguewas initiated in the late 19th century by the efforts of Eliezer Ben-Yehuda. He joined theJewish national movementand in 1881 immigrated toPalestine, then a part of theOttoman Empire. Motivated by the surrounding ideals of renovation and rejection of thediaspora"shtetl" lifestyle, Ben-Yehuda set out to develop tools for making theliteraryandliturgical languageinto everydayspoken language. However, his brand of Hebrew followed norms that had been replaced inEastern Europeby different grammar and style, in the writings of people likeAhad Ha'amand others. His organizational efforts and involvement with the establishment of schools and the writing of textbooks pushed thevernacularizationactivity into a gradually accepted movement. It was not, however, until the 1904–1914Second Aliyahthat Hebrew had caught real momentum in Ottoman Palestine with the more highly organized enterprises set forth by the new group of immigrants. When theBritish Mandate of Palestinerecognized Hebrew as one of the country's three official languages (English, Arabic, and Hebrew, in 1922), its new formal status contributed to its diffusion. A constructed modern language with a truly Semitic vocabulary and written appearance, although often European inphonology, was to take its place among the current languages of the nations.
While many saw his work as fanciful or evenblasphemous[61](because Hebrew was the holy language of the Torah and therefore some thought that it should not be used to discuss everyday matters), many soon understood the need for a common language amongst Jews of the British Mandate who at the turn of the 20th century were arriving in large numbers from diverse countries and speaking different languages. A Committee of the Hebrew Language was established. After the establishment of Israel, it became theAcademy of the Hebrew Language. The results of Ben-Yehuda's lexicographical work were published in a dictionary (The Complete Dictionary of Ancient and Modern Hebrew,Ben-Yehuda Dictionary[he]). The seeds of Ben-Yehuda's work fell on fertile ground, and by the beginning of the 20th century, Hebrew was well on its way to becoming the main language of the Jewish population of both Ottoman and British Palestine. At the time, members of theOld Yishuvand a very fewHasidicsects, most notably those under the auspices ofSatmar, refused to speak Hebrew and spoke only Yiddish.
In theSoviet Union, the use of Hebrew, along with other Jewish cultural and religious activities, was suppressed. Soviet authorities considered the use of Hebrew "reactionary" since it was associated withZionism, and the teaching of Hebrew at primary and secondary schools was officially banned by thePeople's Commissariat for Educationas early as 1919, as part of an overall agenda aiming tosecularizeeducation (the language itself did not cease to be studied at universities for historical and linguistic purposes[62]). The official ordinance stated that Yiddish, being the spoken language of the Russian Jews, should be treated as their only national language, while Hebrew was to be treated as a foreign language.
[63]Hebrew books and periodicals ceased to be published and were seized from the libraries, although liturgical texts were still published until the 1930s. Despite numerous protests,[64]a policy of suppression of the teaching of Hebrew operated from the 1930s on. Later in the 1980s in theUSSR, Hebrew studies reappeared due to people struggling for permission to go to Israel (refuseniks). Several of the teachers were imprisoned, e.g.
Yosef Begun,Ephraim Kholmyansky,Yevgeny Korostyshevskyand others responsible for a Hebrew learning network connecting many cities of the USSR.
Modern Hebrew[edit]Standard Hebrew, as developed by Eliezer Ben-Yehuda, was based onMishnaicspelling andSephardi Hebrewpronunciation. However, the earliest speakers of Modern Hebrew had Yiddish as their native language and often introducedcalquesfrom Yiddish andphono-semantic matchingsof international words.
Despite using Sephardic Hebrew pronunciation as its primary basis, modern Israeli Hebrew has adapted toAshkenazi Hebrewphonologyin some respects, mainly the following:The vocabulary of Israeli Hebrew is much larger than that of earlier periods. According toGhil'ad Zuckermann:The number of attested Biblical Hebrew words is 8198, of which some 2000 arehapax legomena(the number of Biblical Hebrew roots, on which many of these words are based, is 2099). The number of attested Rabbinic Hebrew words is less than 20,000, of which (i) 7879 are Rabbinic par excellence, i.e. they did not appear in the Old Testament (the number of new Rabbinic Hebrew roots is 805); (ii) around 6000 are a subset of Biblical Hebrew; and (iii) several thousand are Aramaic words which can have a Hebrew form. Medieval Hebrew added 6421 words to (Modern) Hebrew. The approximate number of new lexical items in Israeli is 17,000 (cf. 14,762 in Even-Shoshan 1970 [...]). With the inclusion of foreign and technical terms [...], the total number of Israeli words, including words of biblical, rabbinic and medieval descent, is more than 60,000.
[67]: 64–65In Israel, Modern Hebrew is currently taught in institutions calledUlpanim(singular: Ulpan). There are government-owned, as well as private, Ulpanim offering online courses and face-to-face programs.
Current status[edit]Modern Hebrew is the primary official language of the State of Israel. As of 2013[update], there are about 9 million Hebrew speakers worldwide,[68]of whom 7 million speak it fluently.
[69][70][71]Currently, 90% of Israeli Jews are proficient in Hebrew, and 70% are highly proficient.
[72]Some 60% of Israeli Arabs are also proficient in Hebrew,[72]and 30% report having a higher proficiency in Hebrew than in Arabic.
[18]In total, about 53% of the Israeli population speaks Hebrew as a native language,[73]while most of the rest speak it fluently. In 2013 Hebrew was the native language of 49% of Israelis over the age of 20, withRussian,Arabic,French,English,YiddishandLadinobeing the native tongues of most of the rest. Some 26% ofimmigrants from the former Soviet Unionand 12% of Arabs reported speaking Hebrew poorly or not at all.
[72][74]Steps have been taken to keep Hebrew the primary language of use, and to prevent large-scale incorporation of English words into the Hebrew vocabulary. TheAcademy of the Hebrew Languageof theHebrew University of Jerusalemcurrently invents about 2,000 new Hebrew words each year for modern words by finding an original Hebrew word that captures the meaning, as an alternative to incorporating more English words into Hebrew vocabulary. TheHaifamunicipality has banned officials from using English words in official documents, and is fighting to stop businesses from using only English signs to market their services.
[75]In 2012, aKnessetbill for the preservation of the Hebrew language was proposed, which includes the stipulation that all signage in Israel must first and foremost be in Hebrew, as with all speeches by Israeli officials abroad. The bill's author, MKAkram Hasson, stated that the bill was proposed as a response to Hebrew "losing its prestige" and children incorporating more English words into their vocabulary.
[76]Hebrew is one of several languages for which the constitution of South Africa calls to be respected in their use for religious purposes.
[77]Also, Hebrew is an official national minority language inPoland, since 6 January 2005.
[78]Phonology[edit]Biblical Hebrewhad a typical Semitic consonant inventory, with pharyngeal /ʕ ħ/, a series of "emphatic" consonants (possiblyejective, but this is debated), lateral fricative /ɬ/, and in its older stages also uvular /χ ʁ/. /χ ʁ/ merged into /ħ ʕ/ in later Biblical Hebrew, and /b ɡ d k p t/ underwent allophonic spirantization to [v ɣ ð x f θ] (known asbegadkefat). The earliest Biblical Hebrew vowel system contained the Proto-Semitic vowels /a aː i iː u uː/ as well as /oː/, but this system changed dramatically over time.
By the time of the Dead Sea Scrolls, /ɬ/ had shifted to /s/ in the Jewish traditions, though for the Samaritans it merged with /ʃ/ instead.
[34]The Tiberian reading tradition of the Middle Ages had the vowel system /a ɛ e i ɔ o u ă ɔ̆ ɛ̆/, though other Medieval reading traditions had fewer vowels.
A number of reading traditions have been preserved in liturgical use. In Oriental (SephardiandMizrahi) Jewish reading traditions, the emphatic consonants are realized as pharyngealized, while theAshkenazi(northern and eastern European) traditions have lost emphatics and pharyngeals (although according to Ashkenazi law, pharyngeal articulation is preferred over uvular or glottal articulation when representing the community in religious service such as prayer andTorah reading), and show the shift of /w/ to /v/. TheSamaritantradition has a complex vowel system that does not correspond closely to theTiberiansystems.
Modern Hebrew pronunciation developed from a mixture of the different Jewish reading traditions, generally tending towards simplification. In line withSephardi Hebrewpronunciation, emphatic consonants have shifted to their ordinary counterparts, /w/ to /v/, and [ɣ ð θ] are not present. Most Israelis today also merge /ʕ ħ/ with /ʔ χ/, do not have contrastive gemination, and pronounce /r/ as a uvular fricative [ʁ] or a voiced velar fricative [ɣ] rather than an alveolar trill, because of Ashkenazi Hebrew influences. The consonants /tʃ/ and /dʒ/ have become phonemic due to loan words, and /w/ has similarly been re-introduced.
Consonants[edit]Notes:Hebrew grammar[edit]Hebrew grammar is partlyanalytic, expressing such forms asdative,ablativeandaccusativeusingprepositionalparticles rather thangrammatical cases. However, inflection plays a decisive role in the formation of verbs and nouns. For example, nouns have aconstruct state, called "smikhut", to denote the relationship of "belonging to": this is the converse of thegenitive caseof more inflected languages. Words in smikhut are often combined withhyphens. In modern speech, the use of the construct is sometimes interchangeable with the preposition "shel", meaning "of". There are many cases, however, where older declined forms are retained (especially in idiomatic expressions and the like), and "person"-encliticsare widely used to "decline" prepositions.
Morphology[edit]Like all Semitic languages, the Hebrew language exhibits a pattern of stems consisting typically of "triliteral", or 3-consonantconsonantal roots, from which nouns, adjectives, and verbs are formed in various ways: e.g. by inserting vowels, doubling consonants, lengthening vowels and/or adding prefixes, suffixes orinfixes. 4-consonant roots also exist and became more frequent in the modern language due to a process of coining verbs from nouns that are themselves constructed from 3-consonant verbs. Some triliteral roots lose one of their consonants in most forms and are called "Nahim" (Resting).
Hebrew uses a number ofone-letter prefixesthat are added to words for various purposes. These are called inseparable prepositions or "Letters of Use" (Hebrew:אותיות השימוש,romanized:Otiyot HaShimush). Such items include: the definitearticleha-(/ha/) (= "the");prepositionsbe-(/be/) (= "in"),le-(/le/) (= "to"; a shortened version of the prepositionel),mi-(/mi/) (= "from"; a shortened version of the prepositionmin);conjunctionsve-(/ve/) (= "and"),she-(/ʃe/) (= "that"; a shortened version of the Biblical conjunctionasher),ke-(/ke/) (= "as", "like"; a shortened version of the conjunctionkmo).
The vowel accompanying each of these letters may differ from those listed above, depending on the first letter or vowel following it. The rules governing these changes are hardly observed in colloquial speech as most speakers tend to employ the regular form. However, they may be heard in more formal circumstances. For example, if a preposition is put before a word that begins with a movingShva, then the preposition takes the vowel/i/(and the initial consonant may be weakened): colloquialbe-kfar(= "in a village") corresponds to the more formalbi-khfar.
The definite article may be inserted between a preposition or a conjunction and the word it refers to, creating composite words likemé-ha-kfar(= "from the village"). The latter also demonstrates the change in the vowel ofmi-. Withbe,leandke, the definite article is assimilated into the prefix, which then becomesba,laorka. Thus *be-ha-matosbecomesba-matos(= "in the plane"). Note that this does not happen tomé(the form of "min" or "mi-" used before the letter "he"), thereforemé-ha-matosis a valid form, which means "from the airplane".
Syntax[edit]Like most other languages, the vocabulary of the Hebrew language is divided into verbs, nouns, adjectives and so on, and its sentence structure can be analyzed by terms like object, subject and so on.
Writing system[edit]Users of the language write Modern Hebrew fromright to leftusing theHebrew alphabet- an "impure"abjad, or consonant-only script, of 22 letters. The ancientpaleo-Hebrew alphabetresembles those used forCanaaniteandPhoenician.
[citation needed]Modern scripts derive from the "square" letter form, known asAshurit(Assyrian), which developed from theAramaic script. Acursive Hebrewscript is used in handwriting: the letters tend to appear more circular in form when written in cursive, and sometimes vary markedly from their printed equivalents. The medieval version of the cursive script forms the basis of another style, known asRashi script. When necessary, vowels are indicated by diacritic marks above or below the letter representing the syllabic onset, or by use ofmatres lectionis, which are consonantal letters used as vowels. Further diacritics may serve to indicate variations in the pronunciation of the consonants (e.g.
bet/vet,shin/sin); and, in some contexts, to indicate the punctuation, accentuation and musical rendition of Biblical texts (seeHebrew cantillation).
Liturgical use in Judaism[edit]Hebrew has always been used as the language of prayer and study, and the following pronunciation systems are found.
Ashkenazi Hebrew, originating in Central and Eastern Europe, is still widely used in Ashkenazi Jewish religious services and studies in Israel and abroad, particularly in theHarediand otherOrthodoxcommunities. It was influenced byYiddishpronunciation.
Sephardi Hebrewis the traditional pronunciation of theSpanish and Portuguese JewsandSephardi Jewsin the countries of the formerOttoman Empire, with the exception ofYemenite Hebrew. This pronunciation, in the form used by the Jerusalem Sephardic community, is the basis of theHebrew phonologyof Israeli native speakers. It was influenced byLadinopronunciation.
Mizrahi (Oriental) Hebrewis actually a collection of dialects spoken liturgically by Jews in various parts of theArabandIslamicworld. It was derived from the oldArabic language, and in some cases influenced bySephardi Hebrew.
Yemenite HebreworTemanitdiffers from other Mizrahi dialects by having a radically different vowel system, and distinguishing between different diacritically marked consonants that are pronounced identically in other dialects (for example gimel and "ghimel".)These pronunciations are still used in synagogue ritual and religious study in Israel and elsewhere, mostly by people who are not native speakers of Hebrew. However, some traditionalist Israelis use liturgical pronunciations in prayer.
Many synagogues in the diaspora, even though Ashkenazi by rite and by ethnic composition, have adopted the "Sephardic" pronunciation in deference to Israeli Hebrew. However, in many British and American schools and synagogues, this pronunciation retains several elements of its Ashkenazi substrate, especially the distinction betweentsereandsegol.
