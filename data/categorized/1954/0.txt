 It is primarily concerned with giving computers the ability to support and manipulate speech. It involves processing natural language datasets, such as text corpora or speech corpora, using either rule-based or probabilistic (i.e. statistical and, most recently, neural network-based) machine learning approaches. The goal is a computer capable of "understanding" the contents of documents, including the contextual nuances of the language within them. The technology can then accurately extract information and insights contained in the documents as well as categorize and organize the documents themselves.
Challenges in natural language processing frequently involve speech recognition , natural-language understanding , and natural-language generation.
History [ edit ] Natural language processing has its roots in the 1950s. Already in 1950, Alan Turing published an article titled " Computing Machinery and Intelligence " which proposed what is now called the Turing test as a criterion of intelligence, though at the time that was not articulated as a problem separate from artificial intelligence. The proposed test includes a task that involves the automated interpretation and generation of natural language.
Symbolic NLP (1950s – early 1990s) [ edit ] The premise of symbolic NLP is well-summarized by John Searle 's Chinese room experiment: Given a collection of rules (e.g., a Chinese phrasebook, with questions and matching answers), the computer emulates natural language understanding (or other NLP tasks) by applying those rules to the data it confronts.
1950s : The Georgetown experiment in 1954 involved fully automatic translation of more than sixty Russian sentences into English. The authors claimed that within three or five years, machine translation would be a solved problem.
[1] However, real progress was much slower, and after the ALPAC report in 1966, which found that ten-year-long research had failed to fulfill the expectations, funding for machine translation was dramatically reduced. Little further research in machine translation was conducted in America (though some research continued elsewhere, such as Japan and Europe [2] ) until the late 1980s when the first statistical machine translation systems were developed.
1960s : Some notably successful natural language processing systems developed in the 1960s were SHRDLU , a natural language system working in restricted " blocks worlds " with restricted vocabularies, and ELIZA , a simulation of a Rogerian psychotherapist , written by Joseph Weizenbaum between 1964 and 1966. Using almost no information about human thought or emotion, ELIZA sometimes provided a startlingly human-like interaction. When the "patient" exceeded the very small knowledge base, ELIZA might provide a generic response, for example, responding to "My head hurts" with "Why do you say your head hurts?".
Ross Quillian 's successful work on natural language was demonstrated with a vocabulary of only twenty words, because that was all that would fit in a computer memory at the time.
[3] 1970s : During the 1970s, many programmers began to write "conceptual ontologies ", which structured real-world information into computer-understandable data. Examples are MARGIE (Schank, 1975), SAM (Cullingford, 1978), PAM (Wilensky, 1978), TaleSpin (Meehan, 1976), QUALM (Lehnert, 1977), Politics (Carbonell, 1979), and Plot Units (Lehnert 1981). During this time, the first chatterbots were written (e.g., PARRY ).
1980s : The 1980s and early 1990s mark the heyday of symbolic methods in NLP. Focus areas of the time included research on rule-based parsing (e.g., the development of HPSG as a computational operationalization of generative grammar ), morphology (e.g., two-level morphology [4] ), semantics (e.g., Lesk algorithm ), reference (e.g., within Centering Theory [5] ) and other areas of natural language understanding (e.g., in the Rhetorical Structure Theory ). Other lines of research were continued, e.g., the development of chatterbots with Racter and Jabberwacky.
 An important development (that eventually led to the statistical turn in the 1990s) was the rising importance of quantitative evaluation in this period.
[6] Statistical NLP (1990s–2010s) [ edit ] Up to the 1980s, most natural language processing systems were based on complex sets of hand-written rules. Starting in the late 1980s, however, there was a revolution in natural language processing with the introduction of machine learning algorithms for language processing. This was due to both the steady increase in computational power (see Moore's law ) and the gradual lessening of the dominance of Chomskyan theories of linguistics (e.g.
transformational grammar ), whose theoretical underpinnings discouraged the sort of corpus linguistics that underlies the machine-learning approach to language processing.
[7] 1990s : Many of the notable early successes on statistical methods in NLP occurred in the field of machine translation , due especially to work at IBM Research, such as IBM alignment models.
 These systems were able to take advantage of existing multilingual textual corpora that had been produced by the Parliament of Canada and the European Union as a result of laws calling for the translation of all governmental proceedings into all official languages of the corresponding systems of government. However, most other systems depended on corpora specifically developed for the tasks implemented by these systems, which was (and often continues to be) a major limitation in the success of these systems. As a result, a great deal of research has gone into methods of more effectively learning from limited amounts of data.
2000s : With the growth of the web, increasing amounts of raw (unannotated) language data has become available since the mid-1990s. Research has thus increasingly focused on unsupervised and semi-supervised learning algorithms. Such algorithms can learn from data that has not been hand-annotated with the desired answers or using a combination of annotated and non-annotated data. Generally, this task is much more difficult than supervised learning , and typically produces less accurate results for a given amount of input data. However, there is an enormous amount of non-annotated data available (including, among other things, the entire content of the World Wide Web ), which can often make up for the inferior results if the algorithm used has a low enough time complexity to be practical.
Neural NLP (present) [ edit ] In 2003, word n-gram model , at the time the best statistical algorithm, was overperformed by a multi-layer perceptron (with a single hidden layer and context length of several words trained on up to 14 million of words with a CPU cluster in language modelling ) by Yoshua Bengio with co-authors.
[8] In 2010, Tomáš Mikolov (then a PhD student at Brno University of Technology ) with co-authors applied a simple recurrent neural network with a single hidden layer to language modelling, [9] and in the following years he went on to develop Word2vec.
 In the 2010s, representation learning and deep neural network -style (featuring many hidden layers) machine learning methods became widespread in natural language processing. That popularity was due partly to a flurry of results showing that such techniques [10] [11] can achieve state-of-the-art results in many natural language tasks, e.g., in language modeling [12] and parsing.
[13] [14] This is increasingly important in medicine and healthcare , where NLP helps analyze notes and text in electronic health records that would otherwise be inaccessible for study when seeking to improve care [15] or protect patient privacy.
[16] Approaches: Symbolic, statistical, neural networks [ edit ] Symbolic approach, i.e., the hand-coding of a set of rules for manipulating symbols, coupled with a dictionary lookup, was historically the first approach used both by AI in general and by NLP in particular: [17] [18] such as by writing grammars or devising heuristic rules for stemming.
Machine learning approaches, which include both statistical and neural networks, on the other hand, have many advantages over the symbolic approach: both statistical and neural networks methods can focus more on the most common cases extracted from a corpus of texts, whereas the rule-based approach needs to provide rules for both rare cases and common ones equally.
language models , produced by either statistical or neural networks methods, are more robust to both unfamiliar (e.g. containing words or structures that have not been seen before) and erroneous input (e.g. with misspelled words or words accidentally omitted) in comparison to the rule-based systems, which are also more costly to produce.
the larger such a (probabilistic) language model is, the more accurate it becomes, in contrast to rule-based systems that can gain accuracy only by increasing the amount and complexity of the rules leading to intractability problems.
Although rule-based systems for manipulating symbols were still in use in 2020, they have become mostly obsolete with the advance of LLMs in 2023.
Before that they were commonly used: when the amount of training data is insufficient to successfully apply machine learning methods, e.g., for the machine translation of low-resource languages such as provided by the Apertium system, for preprocessing in NLP pipelines, e.g., tokenization , or for postprocessing and transforming the output of NLP pipelines, e.g., for knowledge extraction from syntactic parses.
Statistical approach [ edit ] In the late 1980s and mid-1990s, the statistical approach ended a period of AI winter , which was caused by the inefficiencies of the rule-based approaches.
[19] [20] The earliest decision trees , producing systems of hard if–then rules , were still very similar to the old rule-based approaches. Only the introduction of hidden Markov models, applied to part-of-speech tagging, announced the end of the old rule-based approach.
Neural networks [ edit ] A major drawback of statistical methods is that they require elaborate feature engineering.
 Since 2015, [21] the statistical approach was replaced by neural networks approach, using word embeddings to capture semantic properties of words.
Intermediate tasks (e.g., part-of-speech tagging and dependency parsing) have not been needed anymore.
Neural machine translation , based on then-newly-invented sequence-to-sequence transformations, made obsolete the intermediate steps, such as word alignment, previously necessary for statistical machine translation.
Common NLP tasks [ edit ] The following is a list of some of the most commonly researched tasks in natural language processing. Some of these tasks have direct real-world applications, while others more commonly serve as subtasks that are used to aid in solving larger tasks.
Though natural language processing tasks are closely intertwined, they can be subdivided into categories for convenience. A coarse division is given below.
Text and speech processing [ edit ] Morphological analysis [ edit ] Syntactic analysis [ edit ] Lexical semantics (of individual words in context) [ edit ] Relational semantics (semantics of individual sentences) [ edit ] Discourse (semantics beyond individual sentences) [ edit ] Implicit semantic role labelling Higher-level NLP applications [ edit ] Grammatical error correction General tendencies and (possible) future directions [ edit ] Based on long-standing trends in the field, it is possible to extrapolate future directions of NLP. As of 2020, three trends among the topics of the long-standing series of CoNLL Shared Tasks can be observed: [43] Interest on increasingly abstract, "cognitive" aspects of natural language (1999–2001: shallow parsing, 2002–03: named entity recognition, 2006–09/2017–18: dependency syntax, 2004–05/2008–09 semantic role labelling, 2011–12 coreference, 2015–16: discourse parsing, 2019: semantic parsing).
Increasing interest in multilinguality, and, potentially, multimodality (English since 1999; Spanish, Dutch since 2002; German since 2003; Bulgarian, Danish, Japanese, Portuguese, Slovenian, Swedish, Turkish since 2006; Basque, Catalan, Chinese, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Turkish since 2007; Czech since 2009; Arabic since 2012; 2017: 40+ languages; 2018: 60+/100+ languages) Elimination of symbolic representations (rule-based over supervised towards weakly supervised methods, representation learning and end-to-end systems) Cognition and NLP [ edit ] Most higher-level NLP applications involve aspects that emulate intelligent behaviour and apparent comprehension of natural language. More broadly speaking, the technical operationalization of increasingly advanced aspects of cognitive behaviour represents one of the developmental trajectories of NLP (see trends among CoNLL shared tasks above).
Cognition refers to "the mental action or process of acquiring knowledge and understanding through thought, experience, and the senses." [44] Cognitive science is the interdisciplinary, scientific study of the mind and its processes.
[45] Cognitive linguistics is an interdisciplinary branch of linguistics, combining knowledge and research from both psychology and linguistics.
[46] Especially during the age of symbolic NLP , the area of computational linguistics maintained strong ties with cognitive studies.
As an example, George Lakoff offers a methodology to build natural language processing (NLP) algorithms through the perspective of cognitive science, along with the findings of cognitive linguistics , [47] with two defining aspects: Apply the theory of conceptual metaphor , explained by Lakoff as "the understanding of one idea, in terms of another" which provides an idea of the intent of the author.
[48] For example, consider the English word big.
 When used in a comparison ("That is a big tree"), the author's intent is to imply that the tree is physically large relative to other trees or the authors experience. When used metaphorically ("Tomorrow is a big day"), the author's intent to imply importance.
 The intent behind other usages, like in "She is a big person", will remain somewhat ambiguous to a person and a cognitive NLP algorithm alike without additional information.
Assign relative measures of meaning to a word, phrase, sentence or piece of text based on the information presented before and after the piece of text being analyzed, e.g., by means of a probabilistic context-free grammar (PCFG). The mathematical equation for such algorithms is presented in.

Nevertheless, approaches to develop cognitive models towards technically operationalizable frameworks have been pursued in the context of various frameworks, e.g., of cognitive grammar, [49] functional grammar, [50] construction grammar, [51] computational psycholinguistics and cognitive neuroscience (e.g., ACT-R ), however, with limited uptake in mainstream NLP (as measured by presence on major conferences [52] of the ACL ). More recently, ideas of cognitive NLP have been revived as an approach to achieve explainability , e.g., under the notion of "cognitive AI".
[53] Likewise, ideas of cognitive NLP are inherent to neural models multimodal NLP (although rarely made explicit) [54] and developments in Artificial intelligence , specifically tools and technologies using Large language model approaches.

^ Chomskyan linguistics encourages the investigation of " corner cases " that stress the limits of its theoretical models (comparable to pathological phenomena in mathematics), typically created using thought experiments , rather than the systematic investigation of typical phenomena that occur in real-world data, as is the case in corpus linguistics.
 The creation and use of such corpora of real-world data is a fundamental part of machine-learning algorithms for natural language processing. In addition, theoretical underpinnings of Chomskyan linguistics such as the so-called " poverty of the stimulus " argument entail that general learning algorithms, as are typically used in machine learning, cannot be successful in language processing. As a result, the Chomskyan paradigm discouraged the application of such models to language processing.

This was an early Deep Learning tutorial at the ACL 2012 and met with both interest and (at the time) skepticism by most participants. Until then, neural learning was basically rejected because of its lack of statistical interpretability. Until 2015, deep learning had evolved into the major framework of NLP.

"This murder mystery competition has revealed that although NLP ( natural-language processing ) models are capable of incredible feats, their abilities are very much limited by the amount of context they receive. This [...] could cause [difficulties] for researchers who hope to use them to do things such as analyze ancient languages.
 In some cases, there are few historical records on long-gone civilizations to serve as training data for such a purpose." (p. 82.) Daniel Jurafsky and James H. Martin (2008).
