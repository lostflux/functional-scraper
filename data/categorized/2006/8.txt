AdvertisementThe role of double-strand break repair — insights from human geneticsNature Reviews Geneticsvolume7,pages45–54 (2006)Cite this article4383Accesses423Citations3AltmetricMetricsdetailsKey PointsDNA-damage-response mechanisms encompass pathways of DNA-repair and signal-transduction processes that regulate cell-cycle-checkpoint arrest and/or apoptosis. The signal-transduction processes can regulate at least some aspects of DNA repair.
There are two main double-strand break (DSB) repair pathways — homologous recombination and non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ).
The main signal-transduction pathway that responds to a DSB is regulated by ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), the protein that is defective in the hereditary disorder ataxia telangiectasia. Ataxia telangiectasia and RAD3-related (ATR) probably also has a supporting role in the response to DSBs.
Coupling occurs between ATM-dependent signalling and DSB repair. ATM regulates Artemis-dependent processing of a subset of DNA ends, which is required before rejoining by NHEJ can occur.
Several human congenital disorders with defects in damage-response mechanisms to DSBs have been described. These include, LIG4 syndrome, severe combined immunodeficiency with sensitivity to ionizing radiation, ataxia telangiectasia, ataxia telangiectasia-like disorder, Nijmegen breakage syndrome, ATR-Seckel syndrome and Fanconi anaemia, as exemplified by FANCD1 (Fanconi anaemia complementation group D1) deficiency.
These disorders are associated with a pleiotropic range of clinical features that demonstrate the important role that the damage-response processes have during development. Clinical features include immunodeficiency, development delay and microcephaly, cancer development and premature ageing.
The damage-response mechanisms function to maintain genomic stability in somatic cells. During V(D)J recombination and class-switch recombination, the damage-response proteins function to enhance genomic diversity at defined regions. Therefore, immunodeficiency is observed in some of the human DSB-repair-defective disorders.
Assays for diagnosis of damage-response disorders are now available and strategies for palliative treatment are beginning to emerge.
AbstractThe efficient repair of DNA double-strand breaks is crucial in safeguarding the genomic integrity of organisms. Responses to double-strand breaks include complex signal-transduction, cell-cycle-checkpoint and repair pathways. Defects in these pathways lead to several human disorders with pleiotropic clinical features. Dissection of the molecular basis that underlies the diverse clinical features is enhancing our understanding of the damage-response mechanisms and their role in development, and might ultimately facilitate treatment.

MainA DNA double-strand break (DSB) is a critical lesion that can promote genomic instability. Organisms have evolved complex signal-transduction, cell-cycle-checkpoint and repair pathways to respond to damage within DNA and promote genomic stability. In higher organisms, these pathways are also exploited to create genetic diversity during development of the immune system.
Studies using a range of approaches and model systems have advanced our knowledge of the mechanism and function of the DNA-damage-response (DDR) pathways. A principal aim of this research is to understand the roles of these pathways and their contribution to human health. This has implications for elucidating the mechanisms that control genomic stability and cancer development, and ultimately for devising successful therapeutic regimes. The importance of these pathways is highlighted by the growing list of human congenital syndromes that show DDR defects. The pleiotropic range of clinical features seen in such patients has provided valuable insights into the underlying DDR mechanisms and their role.
Here we review the human disorders that are conferred by defects in proteins that function in response to DSBs (Table 1). We describe what is known about DDR pathways and the cross-talk between them. We consider how studies that use model systems have informed our understanding of human disorders andvice versa: how the knowledge gained from studies on human patients have helped to refine results from animal models.
The origin of cellular DSBsDSBs can form in response to exogenously or endogenously generated DNA-damaging agents. Ionizing radiation (IR) produces unique DSBs of high complexity, involving multiple, clustered sites of damage that are introduced directly by energy deposition and indirectly by the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). For example, damaged bases, sugar phosphates and/or single-strand breaks (SSBs) might lie close to a DSB1. By contrast, metabolically generated ROS species are unlikely to give rise to such clustered damage. Nevertheless, DSBs might arise occasionally from closely spaced SSBs or following replication of ROS-induced damage. Although such DSBs might not have the complexity of IR-induced DSBs, they are nevertheless likely to have associated base and sugar damage.
DSBs can also form in a programmed manner during development.
V(D)J recombinationand meiosis involve the programmed generation of site- or region-specific DSBs through specific endonucleases. There is also compelling although indirect evidence that DSBs arise during immunoglobin isotypeclass-switch recombination(CSR) (switching from IgM to other isotypes, for example, IgG)2.
Finally, DSBs might also arise when telomeres become critically shortened, which leads to activation of DDR pathways and the onset of apoptosis and/or senescence3,4. The difference in nature of the various exogenously and endogenously generated DSBs influences which processing factors are required before break rejoining can ensue (Table 2). In addition, how and in what context the DSB is generated determines which rejoining mechanism is used (seeTable 2and the discussion below).
DSB response mechanismsDDR pathways encompass processes of DNA-repair and signal-transduction mechanisms that alert the cell to the presence of DNA damage and coordinate the appropriate response5. The signal-transduction processes that are activated by DSBs depend on the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase related kinases (PIKKs) — ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and ataxia telangiectasia and RAD3-related (ATR); the main DSB-repair pathways include DNA non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR) (Table 3). There is mounting evidence for an interplay between the damage-response signalling machinery and DNA-repair pathways; recent studies indicate that at least some aspects of HR and NHEJ are regulated in an ATR-dependent or ATM-dependent manner6,7,8(see below for further discussion).
DSB-induced signal transduction.
The main PIKK that responds to a DSB is ATM — the protein that is defective in the hereditary disorderataxia telangiectasia(AT). Collectively, the signal-transduction pathway encompasses proteins that are required for damage sensing, mediator and transducer proteins that transmit the signal, and effector proteins that carry out the particular response, such as cell-cycle-checkpoint arrestor apoptosis9. Current evidence indicates that the MRE11–RAD50–NBS1 complex (MRN complex) is the primary DSB sensor that recruits ATM to the DSB10. Another early step in the response to a DSB involves phosphorylation of the H2A histone family, member X, H2AFX, which can be carried out redundantly by ATM or DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK)11. H2AFX phosphorylation (termed γ-H2AFX) occurs over megabase-pair regions that produce discrete, microscopically detectable foci12. Formation of γ-H2AFX foci is required to retain mediator proteins that include tumour protein 53 binding protein 1 (TP53BP1), mediator of DNA damage checkpoint 1 (MDC1), breast cancer 1, early onset (BRCA1) and the MRN complex at the DSB13. Additionally, chromatin relaxation in the vicinity of the DSB has been proposed to expose constitutively methylated lysine residues on histone H3, which facilitates the recruitment of TP53BP1 (Ref.
14). As this step occurs independently of ATM, it has been argued that TP53BP1 also has a damage-sensing role15. The accumulation of these proteins at a DSB enhances, but is not essential for, checkpoint arrest16.
The recruitment of the MRN complex to γ-H2AFX foci, coupled with further analysis of MRN-deficient cells, has provided evidence for a second role of the MRN complex as a mediator in ATM signalling17. ATM regulates arrest at three crucial checkpoints after IR18. G1–S arrest provides a prolonged time for DNA repair before replication, whereas permanent G1–S arrest might prevent the proliferation of damaged cells. ATMdependent G1–S arrest depends on tumour protein 53 (TP53) and checkpoint 2 (CHEK2), and requires activation of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor, p21. Intra-S-phase checkpoint arrest explains the classical radiation-resistant DNA-synthesis phenotype of AT cells and involves the inhibition of firing of late-replicating origins. Finally, ATM regulates a G2–M arrest for cells that are in G2 at the time of irradiation18.
ATR is activated by single-stranded regions of DNA that are generated as a result of replication-fork stalling or during the repair of bulky lesions19. Hypomorphic mutations in ATR have been found in a subset of patients withSeckel syndrome(ATR-Seckel) — a disorder that is characterized by proportionate dwarfism, developmental delay and severe microcephaly20(Table 1). ATR phosphorylation substrates overlap with those of ATM, and ATR brings about similar cell-cycle-checkpoint arrest5. The pronounced phosphorylation and cell-cycle-checkpoint defects in AT cells soon after IR attest to the fact that ATM has a major role in responding to DSBs. However, ATR-dependent phosphorylation and checkpoint arrest occur later after IR21. One possibility is that ATR is activated at these later times owing to stalling of the replication fork at the IR-induced base damage, unrepaired SSBs or DSBs. Another possibility is that single-stranded regions of DNA are generated by nucleaseresectionat unrepaired DSBs. Significantly,lymphoblastoid cell lines, in which ATR is deficient, show elevated nuclear fragmentation after IR, and cells that transiently overexpress a dominant negative version of ATR in which the kinase activity has been knocked out show modest (twofold) IR sensitivity22,23. ATR activation after IR might be important to stabilize stalled replication forks or to activate HR, as both events have been shown to be ATR-dependent in other situations8,24,25.
DSB-repair pathways.
The proteins that are required for NHEJ include the heterodimer KU and the catalytic subunit of the DNA-dependent protein kinase, DNA-PKcs (officially known as protein kinase, DNA-activated, catalytic polypeptide (PRKDC)), which associates with DNA-bound KU26,27. A complex of XRCC4 and DNA ligase IV (LIG4) is recruited by the assembled DNA-PK complex to carry out ligation (Fig. 1;Table 3).
a| Homologous recombination (HR) takes place in late S–G2 phase and involves the generation of a single-stranded region of DNA, followed by strand invasion, formation of a Holliday junction, DNA synthesis using the intact strand as a template, branch migration and resolution. Non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) takes place throughout the cell cycle and involves binding of the KU heterodimer to double-stranded DNA ends, recruitment of DNA-PKcs (officially known as protein kinase, DNA-activated, catalytic polypeptide (PRKDC)), processing of ends (including Artemis-dependent processing) and recruitment of the DNA ligase IV (LIG4)–XRCC4 complex, which brings about ligation. The ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) protein affects NHEJ as it is required for Artemis-dependent end processing. ATM signalling is the main signal-transduction process that responds to a DSB. Ataxia telangiectasia and RAD3-related (ATR) signalling is activated later after irradiation, probably when radiation-induced lesions block replication. Both pathways lead to cell-cycle-checkpoint activation, which allows more time for repair or permanently prevents the proliferation of damaged cells. An important step in ATM- and ATR-dependent signalling is phosphorylation of H2A histone family, member X (H2AFX) and recruitment of the mediator proteins, mediator of DNA damage checkpoint 1 (MDC1), tumour protein 53 binding protein 1 (TP53BP1) and the MRN (MRE11–RAD50–NBS1) complex. Additional proteins, such as structural maintenance of chromosomes 1 (SMC1), are also recruited to the site of damage. Other proteins that are recruited to the foci, such as replication protein A (RPA) and Bloom syndrome (BLM), have not been shown for clarity. ATR signalling is activated by single-stranded regions of DNA that arise, for example, at stalled replication forks. RPA coats single-stranded DNA and recruits ATR and its partner ATRIP (ATR-interacting protein). H2AFX phosphorylation, recruitment of mediator proteins and downstream phosphorylation occur in a process that is similar to the ATM-dependent pathway, although with some distinctions (for example, CHEK1 and CHEK2 (checkpoint 1 and 2) might be differently phosphorylated by ATM versus ATR). HR probably depends on ATR, either to stabilize stalled replication forks and/or to activate the process of HR. DNA crosslinks are repaired through a process that probably generates a DSB as an intermediate.
b| DDR syndromes in which pathways that respond to DSBs are affected. AT, ataxia telangiectasia; ATLD, ataxia telangiectasia-like disorder; FA, Fanconi anaemia; FANCD2, Fanconi anaemia complementation group D2; NBS, Nijmegen breakage syndrome; PNK, polynucleotide kinase.
NHEJ functions throughout the cell cycle and is the predominant DSB-rejoining mechanism in G1 phase. NHEJ also rejoins DSBs that are introduced during V(D)J recombination. Consequently, when viable, mice that have defective NHEJ-pathway function suffer from severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID)26. KU and DNA-PKcs also have roles in telomere-length maintenance. Premature senescence is seen in KU-deficient mice, whereas DNA-PKcs-deficient mice have progressively shortened telomeres over successive generations28,29. The roles at the telomeres are distinct from the roles in NHEJ.
HR rejoins DSBs using a sister homologue as a template, which provides a high-fidelity, DSB-rejoining mechanism. An early step in HR involves the generation of a single-stranded region of DNA, followed by invasion of the template strand, which creates aHolliday junction(Fig. 1). DNA synthesis using the sister strand as a template is followed by branch migration and subsequent resolution of the heteroduplex (see Refs30,31for reviews). RAD51, a central player in HR, is loaded onto ssDNA and promotes strand invasion, with BRCA2 having a role in delivering RAD51 to the DNA32. BRCA1 is also required for HR, possibly in a regulatory capacity. Other proteins that are involved in HR are listed inTable 3.
HR has a key role in rejoining DSBs that arise as a result of replication-fork stalling. Most proteins that are required for HR are essential, probably because stalling of replication forks occurs during most cycles of replication24,33. Cells that lack HR are only mildly radiosensitive, but are highly sensitive to DNA-crosslinking agents31,34. This phenotype is consistent with the idea that the primary function of HR is to repair DSBs at the replication fork, whereas NHEJ primarily repairs DSBs that have been generated elsewhere in the DNA.
Coupled signalling and DSB repair.
The NHEJ proteins assemble at DSBs and carry out most DSB rejoining in the absence of ATM and the MRN complex, which indicates that core NHEJ occurs independently of ATM signalling6. Conversely, ATM signalling occurs independently of NHEJ as NHEJ-defective cell lines arrest normally at cell-cycle checkpoints in response to DSBs35. However, although 90% of the DSBs are repaired with normal kinetics in AT cell lines, 10% of the DSBs, which represents those that are repaired with slow kinetics in control cells, fail to be rejoined6,36. In non-replicating cells, these unrejoined DSBs persist for prolonged periods of time after irradiation, which is observed using bothpulsed-field gel electrophoresisand the analysis of γ-H2AFX foci by immunofluorescence37. Artemis, the protein that is defective in patients withsevere combined immunodeficiency with sensitivity to ionizing radiation(RS-SCID) (see below), the MRN complex, TP53BP1 and H2AFX are also required for this subset of DSB repair6. Artemis belongs to a sub-group (the β-CASP family) of the metallo-β-lactamase superfamily38. It has exonuclease activityin vitro, and when complexed with and/or phosphorylated by DNA-PKcs, it gains the ability to cleave single-strand overhangs and hairpins that are formed during V(D)J recombination39. It has been proposed that Artemis is required to process a fraction of DNA ends before NHEJ. This process is important for survival after irradiation, as Artemis-deficient cells show similar radiation sensitivity to AT cells, at least if irradiated whenconfluent6. This observation reveals an interesting interplay between ATM signalling and DSB repair, whereby ATM regulates cell-cycle-checkpoint arrest to allow more time to repair 'complex' DSBs through a process that it also regulates. During V(D)J recombination, Artemis-mediated cleavage of coding-junction hairpins does not require ATM, the MRN complex, TP53BP1 or H2AFX, as mice or patients that lack these components do not show a SCID phenotype40,41. It has also been proposed that Artemis is required for efficient G2–M arrest after IR42.
Human disorders that affect DSB responsesGenetic disorders that affect DSB rejoining are listed inTable 1. In some cases, the study of human patients and cell lines that are derived from them has been the driving force in unravelling pathway function (for example, the work on ATM); in other cases, studies on model systems (Table 4) have identified protein functions that were subsequently exploited to identify defects in patients (for example,LIG4 syndrome).
Because many of the DDR proteins are essential, the mutations that have been identified in patients are hypomorphic, often retaining significant residual activity. This is an important caveat when correlating protein function with clinical manifestation. The disorders are usually recessive, requiring diminished function of both alleles. Such hereditary disorders are therefore more prevalent in consanguineous marriages or locations where the gene pool is small. In some cases the origin of a founder mutation, such as the Slavic mutation inNBS1, has been traced43. Heterozygous mutations inBRCA1andBRCA2are also seen in some hereditary breast-cancer families44. (Although hereditary breast cancer could be considered to represent a damage-response disorder, the heterozygous patients are clinically normal apart from cancer predisposition and have not been included in this review.)Hypomorphic mutations inBRCA2have been identified as theFanconi anaemia complementation group D1(FANCD1) (Ref.
45). Fanconi anaemia (FA) is a multigenic disorder (involving the genesFANCA,B,C,D1,D2,E,F,G,JandL) that is characterized by aplastic anaemia, cancer predisposition and cellular hypersensitivity to DNA-crosslinking agents46,47,48,49. FA, exemplified by FANCD1, has been included inTable 1because a DSB is probably generated as an intermediate in the repair pathway, and because there is close interplay between the FA and HR pathways50,51. Some other disorders not described here, such as dyskeratosis congenita or those that are associated with mutations in members of the RecQ helicase family (Bloom syndrome, Werner syndrome and Rothmund–Thompson syndrome), might also have an indirect effect on DSB repair.
Overlap between DDR pathwaysThe complex interplay between components of the DDR machinery is reflected in the clinical overlap between DDR disorders. For example,Nijmegen breakage syndrome(NBS) has historically been considered to be clinically similar to AT: both conditions are characterized by lymphoid malignancy, similar patterns of genomic instability (chromosome 7–14 translocations), and cellular and clinical radiosensitivity52,53. Consistent with this, the NBS1 protein is implicated in ATM activation and signalling. Furthermore,ataxia telangiectasia-like disorder(ATLD), in which MRE11 is defective, presents as a mild form of AT54. It was recently shown that cells from patients with NBS have defective ATR-dependent signalling55. In fact, clinically, NBS is more reminiscent of ATR-Seckel syndrome than of AT (Table 1). Therefore, NBS might represent a clinical condition that combines aspects of defective ATM and ATR-dependent functions. Furthermore, a specific hypomorphic mutation inNBS1has been found in patients who were initially clinically diagnosed as suffering from FA50,56. Indeed, NBS and FA also share overlapping features (Table 1). NBS1 and FANCD2 proteins can interact and NBS cells also are sensitive to crosslinking agents50. More strikingly, NBS cells show reducedmonoubiquitylationof FANCD2 (Refs55,57). ATR can phosphorylate FANCD2in vitro, and ATR-Seckel cells are defective in the monoubiquitylation of FANCD2 (Ref.
58). The fact that FANCD2 monoubiquitylation is required for FA pathway function couples ATR signalling and NBS1 function to FA pathway activation.
Protein function to clinical role and backEach syndrome that involves DDR defects has a pronounced phenotype that provides essential information for diagnosis. Below we discuss the clinical features in light of the protein function. We consider how the known protein function and defective pathways provide a basis for the features of the diseases, but also how these features provide insights into the role of the DDR pathways during development.
Immunodeficiency.
Variable degrees of immunodeficiency are commonly observed in DSB-defective DDR disorders. The development of the immune response requires the generation of genetic diversity within defined genomic regions (IgV for V(D)J recombination andsomatic hypermutationand IgC for CSR), which contrasts with the genome-wide function of DDR pathways in maintaining genomic stability59. It is now clear that the DDR machinery has been co-opted or exploited by the immune-response pathway to enhance the repertoire of genetically distinct B and T lymphocytes. A striking example is provided by the involvement of NHEJ in V(D)J recombination, which when impaired underlies the characteristic immunodeficiency that is observed in LIG4 syndrome60. Combined immune deficiency (CID) orpancytopeniawith markedly reduced, but not absent, T and B cells is observed in LIG4 syndrome, instead of the SCID phenotype that is observed in knockout mice that have non-functional NHEJ35,61. This is consistent with the hypomorphic mutations found in LIG4 and the fact that a few functional T and B cells can expand to generate a T- and B-cell repertoire, even if with less diversity. Interestingly, one patient with LIG4 syndrome who showed no overt immunodeficiency was identified as a consequence of clinical radiosensitivity62. This patient had higher residual LIG4 activity compared with immunodeficient patients with LIG4 syndrome, which indicates that low levels of activity can be sufficient for immune-system function63.
A pronounced SCID phenotype is conferred by loss of Artemis, which is consistent with the proposed role for this protein in the cleavage of coding-region hairpins during V(D)J recombination38. Because Artemis has a relatively minor role in DSB rejoining, the protein is not essential for development and its loss can be tolerated, although it does cause dramatic immunodeficiency6. Patients with 'leaky' Artemis mutations have partial T- and B-lymphocyte deficiencies that are similar to those with LIG4 syndrome, although they frequently succumb to Epstein–Barr virus (EBV)-associated lymphomas — which is a potential consequence of reduced T-cell-mediated immune surveillance64. Interestingly, hypomorphic Artemis mutations have also been found in a radiosensitive individual withOmenn syndrome65. This syndrome is a primary immune-deficiency disorder that is usually associated with mutations in the recombination activating genes,RAG1andRAG2, which encode the site-specific endonuclease that initiates V(D)J recombintation66.
In contrast to these marked immunodeficient phenotypes, AT, ATLD and NBS are associated with milder, non-specific immunodeficiency that is frequently observed as a deficiency in specific Ig subsets. Recent studies that use mouse models have shown that ATM and the MRN complex are required for CSR, which provides a basis for the observed immunodeficiency67,68,69,70,71. Patients with AT, ATLD and NBS frequently also have genomic translocations at V(D)J sites (chromosome 7–14 translocations) — a feature that is also observed in AT mice72,73. This raises the possibility that ATM and the MRN complex promote accurate rejoining during V(D)J recombination.
Developmental delay and microcephaly.
Other common features that are observed in DDR-defective disorders include growth and developmental delay, microcephaly and characteristic facial features. The last of these is probably a consequence of the microcephaly — which is is manifested as reducedoccipitofrontal circumferenceowing to a small cerebral cortex — that is associated with largely unaltered facial dimensions. Although such features are observed in LIG4 syndrome, NBS, ATR-Seckel and FA, they are not seen in AT, ATLD or RS-SCID (Table 1). By contrast, AT and ATLD show progressive neurodegeneration with characteristic progressiveataxia72.
An important insight into the roles of the DDR proteins during neuronal development has been provided by the analysis of various DDR-defective mouse models. The developing nervous system of the mouse can be divided into the ventricular zone (VZ), a region of high proliferation, and the subventricular zone (SVZ), which contains the differentiated post-mitotic neurons74. Recent data have highlighted the fact that NHEJ and HR activities are spatially and temporally distinct in the developing mouse brain: HR is restricted to the proliferative VZ and NHEJ to the SVZ75. The developing nervous system seems to be highly susceptible to DNA-damage-induced apoptosis. However, irradiation of ATM-null mice results in loss of apoptosis in the SVZ, but not in the VZ region. By contrast, TP53 is required for apoptosis in both regions75,76. LIG4 deficiency leads to apoptosis in only the SVZ region75. These findings indicate that NHEJ might be important during neuronal development in non-proliferating regions, which is consistent with its known role in DSB repair outside S phase. Further investigation of the role of HR in similar regions might highlight a role for ATR signalling in the rapidly proliferating VZ region.
The origin of DSBs in the developing nervous system is still unclear. They could arise as a consequence of rapid proliferation or from endogenously generated oxidative damage. Nervous-system cells might encounter more oxidative damage than other cell types; alternatively, they might be primed to readily undergo apoptosis in the face of unrepaired DSBs. The basis for the selective loss ofPurkinje neuronsand the consequent dramatic ataxia that is observed in AT is still unclear, although ROS have been implicated77. Although it has been proposed that this loss might represent a failure of post-mitotic Purkinje neurons to remain in a non-cycling state, recent evidence has shown that other syndromes that are characterized by ataxia — for example, ocular apraxia andspinocerebellar ataxia, autosomal recessive, with axonal neuropathy(SCAN1) — have defects in SSB repair, which raises the possibility that either repair or signalling from SSBs should also be considered during neuronal development78,79.
Cancer development.
Unrepaired DSBs probably trigger apoptosis or permanent cell-cycle arrest. Although this might have important clinical manifestations (for example, SCID, ataxia and microcephaly), it is unlikely to lead to carcinogenesis. Nevertheless, there is mounting evidence that unrejoined DSBs can undergo various processes of mis-rejoining, including telomere-break fusion events and telomere capping, that could potentially lead to carcinogenesis80. It is also possible that diminished activity of a protein that is required for DSB rejoining, such as LIG4, can lead to residual DSB rejoining of decreased fidelity. However, the operation of efficient cell-cycle-checkpoint arrest is a crucial barrier to cancer development. Strikingly, the collective phenotypes for AT and NBS include a mild DNA-repair defect accompanied by cell-cycle-checkpoint defects36. It is this dual defect that might account for why AT cells have been associated more with a misrepair defect than with a lack of repair. A prevailing feature of the DSB-repair disorders is a predisposition to tumours of lymphoid origin. This probably reflects the role of these proteins in promoting accurate DSB rejoining during immune development (V(D)J recombination and CSR) and/or eliminating cells with inappropriate rejoining.
Too few patients with ATR-Seckel have been identified to assess whether this syndrome is also associated with cancer predisposition. Nevertheless, there are reports of lymphoid abnormalities in genetically uncharacterized patients with Seckel syndrome81,82,83.
Telomere shortening and premature ageing.
AT is frequently categorized as a premature ageing syndrome; this is in part due to the progressive neurological deterioration that is observed in patients. AT is also associated with early onset of type II diabetes, another age-related disorder. Accelerated telomere shortening is seen in AT peripheral blood lymphocytes, a feature that is linked to premature senescence84. Accelerated telomere shortening is also seen in AT mice85, and Tel1, a homologue of ATM, is required for telomere maintenance in yeast86. However, AT is also associated with elevated oxidative stress, which raises the possibility that premature ageing is influenced by early cellular senescence owing to unrepaired or misrepaired DNA damage87. KU- and DNA-PKcs-defective mice also show features of premature ageing, including increased intestinal atrophy andkyphosis, which is further elevated in mice that are doubly deficient for KU or DNA-PKcs and telomerase28,29,88. Although there is no evidence that LIG4 localizes to telomeres or that it is involved in telomere maintenance, there are some features of premature ageing in patients with LIG4 syndrome, such as skin abnormalities (psoriasis and squamous patchesand photosensitivity) and type II diabetes. The small number of patients and paucity of features precludes any firm conclusions about how loss of LIG4 might affect ageing35.
The future: diagnosis and therapyReliable cellular assays, such as chromosomal radiosensitivity in lymphocytes, in combination with clinical features aid the accurate diagnosis of most known DDR disorders. One possible exception is Seckel syndrome. So far, only one mutation inATRhas been associated with Seckel syndrome, but Seckel syndrome is genetically heterogenous and other patients with a normal ATR sequence have been shown to have defects in the ATR-signalling pathway, which indicates that the mutation lies in a downstream component of the pathway20,23.
Treatment of most DDR-defective conditions with congenital abnormalities is palliative. Bone marrow transplantation offers curative potential for some manifestations and has been successfully used in LIG4 syndrome, NBS, FA and RS-SCID89. Because standard conditioning regimens before bone marrow transplantation involve treatment with DSB-inducing agents (such as carmustine, cyclophosphamide, etoposide, carboplatin or whole-body irradiation), they need to be tailored for each particular DDR disorder (see for example Ref.
89). Furthermore, because many DDR disorders include cancer predisposition, radiotherapeutic and chemotherapeutic regimens also need to be modified to avoid adverse reactions. Therefore, an undiagnosed DDR patient can potentially show a dramatic, and indeed fatal, overresponse to such therapy90,91.
One example of palliative treatment that is currently receiving strong attention is aimed at tackling the progressive ataxia in AT with antioxidant therapy (using α-lipoic acid) to diminish neurodegeneration87,92. Another exciting development that has recently been proposed involves using aminoglycoside antibiotics as a curative approach for patients with AT who carry primary truncating mutations93. Approximately 14% of ATM mutations are single nucleotide changes that directly generate premature termination codons; aminoglycoside antibiotics can cause premature termination-codon read-through. Use of this approach in AT cell lines has demonstrated that read-through leads to functional expression of full-length ATM. Indeed, aminoglycoside-induced premature termination-codon read-through has been examined as a curative strategy for cystic fibrosis, muscular dystrophy, diabetes insipidus, Hurler syndrome and X-linked retinitis pigmentosa93.
Another exciting strategy has been proposed for the treatment of breast cancers that arise inBRCA1orBRCA2heterozygous mutation carriers. Such tumours are defective in their ability to carry out HR owing to loss of BRCA1 or BRCA2 function. Such tumours are exquisitely sensitive to inhibition of poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP), which is required for another repair pathway that enhances the reliance on HR94,95.
Tumour cells often have an abrogated G1 checkpoint (for example, as a result of mutations in TP53) coupled with a functional G2 checkpoint. Pharmacological inhibition of the G2–M checkpoint is currently receiving attention as a route to potentiate the cytotoxicity of IR and DNA-damaging drugs, which has obvious implications for the treatment of TP53-defective tumours96. Many compounds that are currently under investigation function by inhibiting DDR proteins such as ATM or ATR (pentoxifylline, lisofylline and A802710) and CHEK1 or CHEK2 (UCN-01, SB218078, staurosproine and hymenialdisine)97. Therefore, the information that is gained from studying DDR-defective cell lines might benefit the search for more effective cancer-treatment strategies.
Concluding remarksAdvances in genetics, coupled with our increasing understanding of DNA damage responses, have led to the identification of several genetic disorders that are conferred by mutations in genes that function in the damage-response pathways. These disorders have provided valuable insight into the function of and interactions between the various DNA-damage-response pathways during development. Our fundamental aim is to exploit findings from basic research to help treat or improve the care of patients with such disorders. Understanding the basis of the diverse clinical features of each disorder provides a stepping stone towards this aim.

This sequence variation is subject to a selection process in the immune system that favours those cells that express immunoglobulins with the highest affinity for the antigen.
Reduced numbers of all types of blood cell.
The circumference of the head as measured from the forehead to the back of the head (occipital bone).
A failure or irregularity of muscular coordination.
A class of large ganglion neurons in the cerebellum.
A posterior or backwards orientated curvature of the thoracic region of the spine.
A generally localized dry scaling or appearance of plate-like layers on the skin.
