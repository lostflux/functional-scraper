While John-117 defends a besieged Earth, and the myriad factions of the Covenant continue their crusade to eliminate humanity, an ultra-secret cell of the Office of Naval Intelligence known as "Section Three" devises a plan to buy theUNSCvital time. They're going to need hundreds of willing soldiers, though...and one more Spartan to get the job done.
Planet Onyx is virtually abandoned and the perfect place to set this new plan in motion. When John-117 destroys Halo, however, something is triggered deep within Onyx. Action begins to boil and the AncientForerunnertechnology stirs. Armadas of UNSC and Covenant race to claim the Forerunner secrets in order to change the course of the Human-Covenant war.

Detailed SummaryConcept art ofOnyx's back cover.
Prologue: Beta Company's Victory at Pegasi DeltaThe prologue begins with the 300 SPARTAN-IIIs ofBeta Companybeing deployed to the Covenant Planet,Pegasi Deltain2545. Out of the 300, 291 hit the ground and proceed towards their target, a Covenant refinery. The Spartans manage to destroy the facility, but due to unexpected heavy Covenant resistance in the form of seven large Covenant cruisers, misidentified as part of the factory by the orbiting STARS Satellite, only two; SPARTANSTom-B292andLucy-B091, survive. Tom and Lucy are revealed to be only twelve years old, and Lucy is severely traumatized and rendered mute, being diagnosed with post traumatic vocal disarticulation after the deaths of the other Spartans and several of her companions fromTeam Foxtrot,Adam-B004andMin-B174.
Section 1: AmbroseThe narrative then moves back to 2531 to a raid bySPARTAN-IIBlue Teamagainst insurrectionists on PlanetVictoriato recover stolenFENRISnuclear warheads. Though the team is captured by General Howard Graves and the rebels, the timely intervention ofKurt-051allows the team to complete their mission without any other serious problems, but Graves is killed during the course of events, preventing the team from learning valuable secrets the General held about the rebels' command and intelligence structure. Five months later,Colonel James Ackersonof Section Three of theOffice of Naval Intelligence, meets with three ONI officers,Rear Admiral Rich,CaptainGibsonand Vice AdmiralParangosky. During the meeting, Ackerson moves forward a proposal for a new SPARTAN program which retains most of the effectiveness of the Series II program without the high costs of the previous project. This becomes the SPARTAN-III program, a more streamlined, "disposable," as well as more numerous, company of SPARTANS that must be trained for high-risk operations where extreme tactics are called for. Also referred to as suicide missions. Ackerson is given the UNSC controlled world Onyx with the purpose of training the SPARTAN-IIIs, and is promised one of the SPARTAN-IIs to train them. The next month, Kurt, Kelly and Fred are sent to Station Delphi in theGroombridge 34 systemto "investigate" a rupturedShaw-Fujikawa Translight Engine. When Kurt tries to approach the engine, his T-Pack malfunctions and sends him spinning away into deep space. Kurt awakes a month later and meets Ackerson, who informs him that the events as Station Delphi were staged in order to recruit him. Kurt is told of the SPARTAN-III project and is given orders to train the volunteers of the SPARTAN-III program. Ackerson promotes him toLieutenant, Junior Gradeand assigns him the surname Ambrose to hide his previous service as a Spartan.
Section 2: SPARTAN-IIIThe section begins on Onyx, where Kurt reduces the four hundred ninety-seven volunteers for theSPARTAN-III programto three hundred trainees by ordering a nighttime high-altitude aerial drop from Pelicans, in order to assess who among the volunteers "wants" to be a Spartan. One of the volunteers,Shane, is frightened by the prospect of a drop, and is taunted by another recruit,Robert. Upon reaching the ground, Shane attacks Robert for teasing him, and the two are separated by Navy personnel, who comment on the aggressiveness of the two, hoping "the rest of them are like this."Several years later, Kurt returns to thePoint of No Returnto be briefed on Alpha Company's performance and to proceed with training for Beta Company, a further 300 recruits selected from 418 candidates. There he learns of the complete destruction of Alpha Company duringOperation: PROMETHEUS. Devastated by the images of the battle and the loss of his soldiers, Kurt improves the training regime forBeta Company, and presses for upgrades to their SPI armor systems, but regardless, most are killed in action duringOperation: TORPEDO, with the exceptions ofTom-B292andLucy-B091who, through Kurt's efforts, are assigned to assist Kurt on Onyx with trainingGamma Company, despite Ackerson's protests. In a further effort to reduce casualties, Kurt then institutes anillegal procedureduringGamma Company's augmentations, this time comprising of 330 recruits, designed to alter the Spartans' brain chemistry and make them resistant to pain and shock. TheAIDeep Winternotices this, but unaware of the perpetrator, tells Kurt, who takes it upon himself to ensure that the files regarding the augmentations are purged.
Section 3: IntrudersThe narrative switches to October 31, 2552, the top three teams of the SPARTAN-IIIGamma Company, TeamsSaber,Katana, andGladius, conduct a training exercise near a restricted area on the planet deemedZone 67, only to find themselves and otherUNSCpersonnel under attack by an unidentified class of alien drones. Very quickly, the few humans on the planet are either wiped out or struggling to survive against this new, unexpected threat. Team Gladius are killed in the attack and Katana are reported missing, with Chief Mendez and team Saber being the only fighting force left to repel the attack. During the attack one of the drones attempts to communicate with Ash, referring to him as a possible Reclaimer. It's believed that the remaining members of Gamma Company may not have been on Onyx at the time.
Section 4: Dr. Catherine HalseyDoctor Catherine HalseyandKelly-087arrive in theZeta Doradus System, as they get closer to Onyx they are attacked by the Drones and crash land. Once on the planet, they meet up with thehumansurvivors of the attacks, including S-III Team Saber, Kurt, and Chief Mendez. Halsey identifies the drones asSentinelsfrom theArtificial intelligence,Cortana's logs of the events ofHalo: Combat Evolved. Halsey proceeds to call for reinforcements, piggybacking her transmission on, ironically, another transmission made by Cortana at the end ofHalo 2. On the message she calls out for caution about the danger coming from theDreadnoughtthat includes SPARTAN-117, as well as the omniscient threat of the Flood, which was trying to escape from Delta Halo at the time.
Section 5: Blue TeamSection five presents Earth, two weeks after the New Mombasa slipspace event, where the planet is under siege by Covenant forces.
Fred-104,Will-043, andLinda-058are pulled out of the line of fire byFleet Admiral Hood, who responds to Halsey's call for reinforcements by dispatching the Spartans to Onyx. After hijacking a Covenant destroyer calledBloodied Spiritand killing all Covenant on board by suffocation, the Spartans head for Onyx, only to be caught in the middle of a battle betweenBruteandEliteships on the way. The Spartans barely escape and arrive at Onyx only to be attacked by the Sentinels. They escape using a Covenant Dropship and link up with the survivors, and then make their way toward the restricted area of Onyx after shaking Sentinel pursuit.
Section 6: The Ghosts of OnyxWithin this section, the story takes place onDelta Halo, where the Covenant are in the midst of a civil war. The Elites intercept Halsey's message, learn of the existence of Onyx and its Forerunner artifacts then regroup at a Covenant world calledJoyous Exultation. There, the Sangheili leaderXytan 'Jar Wattinreerallies the Elites together and discuss the apparent treachery of the Brutes and Prophets, and how to go about handling the situation. Ship MasterVoro 'Mantakreespeaks to his fellow ship masters and suggests that they go to Onyx, as well as be vigilant of theFloodthreat. He is promoted to the rank of Fleet Master and is given command of a fleet of eighteendestroyers, two cruisers, and one carrier. They then prepare to go to Onyx to retrieve theForerunnertechnology. Meanwhile on theCovenantSupercarrierSublime Transcendence, aGruntnamedKwassassstumbles upon theHuragokwho are busy examining what is revealed to beAdmiral Whitcomb'sNOVAbomb. The Huragok unknowingly arm it after Kwassass messes with the arming device for sometime. Shortly after the fleet departs for Onyx, the NOVA detonates, scorching Joyous Exultation with over 300 km per hour winds, severely devastating its surface, shattering its nearby moon, Malhiem, into billions of fragments, and disintegrating the Covenant armada.
Section 7: ReclaimersThe Covenant fleet andUNSC reinforcement fleetarrive at Onyx, where they encounter one another and the Sentinel defenders, which attack anything approaching the system. In the ensuing battle, the entire UNSC fleet is destroyed save for oneprowler-class vessel, which stays hidden and observes events unfolding. The humans on Onyx discover an ancient Forerunner city, Dr. Halsey determines that the entire planet is actually a "Shield World" referred to by the Forerunners asThe Sharpened Shield. The Sharpened Shield was constructed by the Forerunners to protect themselves from the firing of the Halo Array, which are designed to eradicate all sentient life should theFloodescape.
Fighting off determined Covenant pursuers, they press on into the heart of the planet to find its secrets, but not before the ONIAIcommunicates to Dr. Halsey the importance of shutting down a Forerunner factory located at the "tip" of the plant that manufactures a new Sentinel every six seconds, or 600 per hour. After disabling the factory, the group proceeds to the location of Team Katana. They find eight pods that are able to sustain life by opening a very small slipspace wormhole inside of the pod. Making the occupant there but also somewhere else, making him/her/"it" virtually invulnerable to any outside force. Five of theses pods contained members of Katana. It is unknown who or what the other three contain. Possibly Forerunners, or possibly ONI personnel that were active in Zone 67. They then press in to the planet's core, where they discover a Slipspace rift that transports those who pass through it, into a miniaturizedDyson Spherethat is separated from normal space-time by advanced Forerunner Slipspace technology. Entrance to the Slipspace bubble is in countdown, after being activated by the destruction on Halo installation 04. Once the countdown is completed the entrance to the Dyson Sphere will be closed, with no means to reopen it. Will-043 and Holly-G003 fall fighting off the Covenant forces, Will-043 engaging several Hunters in hand-to-hand combat, before meeting his demise, earning him even the Sangheili's respect. Halsey, Mendez, Tom, Lucy, and the other Spartans escape. After promoting Fred-104 to Lieutenant, Junior Grade, giving him charge of the remaining personnel. Kurt remains behind in order to stop the Covenant from following the humans into the Dyson Sphere. He waits for the core doors to fully close and then he lists Kurt Ambrose as MIA under SPARTAN-051 along with the Spartans Will-043, Dante-G188 and Holly-G003, adhering to the tradition of never listing a fallen Spartan as KIA. He ends his life responding to the Elite Fleet Master, "Die? Didn't you know...? Spartans never die," then detonating the twoFENRISnuclear warheads that the team had taken with them.
From outsideOnyx, the surviving UNSC prowlerDuskwatches on as the planet's surface rips apart, to reveal that the entire world is constructed of literally trillions of Sentinels, all connected together to provide an impenetrable defense around the Dyson Sphere at the heart of the planet. Within this sphere, which features terrain similar to that of Earth, Dr Halsey reveals that five pods they recovered after destroying the sentinel factory are pods that suspends the user inside a Slipspace field, the user is extruded into an alternate set of spatial coordinates excluded from time and nothing can harm them, because technically they are not there. 5 of the remaining Spartans, known as Team Katana, are each trapped in aSlipspace Field Pod. Concluding the story, Fred-104 takes command of the remaining survivors who find themselves alone in the vast habitat. Fred orders Dr. Halsey and the others to find the Forerunner artifacts and search for method of escape. Kelly then welcomes the new Spartan III's to the Blue Team, stating that they were "going to make a great team."ReceptionCritical reception toGhosts of Onyxwas mostly positive. IGN stated that it did some "pretty nifty things" and that it was "an interesting and very sneaky way to conclude a story without spoilingHalo 3's story."[1]Arbiter's Judgment stated that it was "a grand continuation of Nylund's previous work, and if you enjoyed it then you will enjoy Ghosts of Onyx, plain and simple."[2]However, Subnova had reviews that were less than positive, stating that "it introduces a new character...well, 300 new characters, while incorporating no old ones, and it dizzies the reader with new facts and information." It also noted how John-117 and Cortana were "ignored," and only appeared in one section, rather than in the past books.
[3]CharactersSequelFor several years,Ghosts of Onyxwas one of the most popularHalonovels to have a sequel made.
Frank O'Connorhad hinted at the possibility of a follow-up toGhosts of Onyx, authored by Eric Nylund. The sequel was already in talks by early 2010.
[5][6]Thesequelto the bestselling novel was announced on July 20, 2010, and despite the earlier talks with Nylund, it was confirmed to be written by Karen Traviss, award-winning novelist and author of theHuman Weaknessshort story inHalo: Evolutions - Essential Tales of the Halo Universe.
