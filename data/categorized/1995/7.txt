; founder ofThe Boring Company; and co-founder ofNeuralinkandOpenAI. With an estimated net worth of around US$265 billion as of May 2022,[4]Musk is the wealthiest person in the world according to both theBloomberg Billionaires Indexand theForbesreal-time billionaires list.
[5][6]Musk was born toWhite South Africanparents inPretoria, where he grew up. He briefly attended theUniversity of Pretoriabefore moving to Canada at age 17, acquiring citizenship through his Canadian-born mother. He matriculated atQueen's Universityand transferred to theUniversity of Pennsylvaniatwo years later, where he received a bachelor's degree in Economics and Physics. He moved to California in 1995 to attendStanford Universitybut decided instead to pursue a business career, co-founding the web software companyZip2with his brotherKimbal. The startup was acquired byCompaqfor $307 million in 1999. The same year, Musk co-founded online bankX.com, which merged withConfinityin 2000 to formPayPal. The company was bought byeBayin 2002 for $1.5 billion.
In 2002, Musk foundedSpaceX, anaerospacemanufacturer and space transport services company, of which he serves as CEO and Chief Engineer. In 2004, he joined electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla Motors, Inc. (now Tesla, Inc.) as chairman and product architect, eventually assuming the position of CEO in 2008. In 2006, he helped createSolarCity, a solar energy company that was later acquired by Tesla and becameTesla Energy. In 2015, he co-founded OpenAI, a nonprofit research company that promotesfriendly artificial intelligence(AI). In 2016, he co-founded Neuralink, aneurotechnologycompany focused on developingbrain–computer interfaces, and founded The Boring Company, atunnel constructioncompany. He alsoagreed to purchasethe major American social networking serviceTwitterin 2022 for $44 billion. Musk has proposed theHyperloop, a high-speedvactraintransportation system. He is the president of theMusk Foundation, an organization which donates to scientific research and education.
Musk has been criticized for making unscientific and controversial statements, such as spreadingmisinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2018, he was sued by theUS Securities and Exchange Commission(SEC) for falsely tweeting that he had secured funding for a private takeover of Tesla; he settled with the SEC, but did not admit guilt, and temporarily stepped down from his Tesla chairmanship. In 2019, he won a defamation case brought against him by a British caver who had advised in theTham Luang cave rescue.
ContentsEarly lifeChildhood and familyElon Reeve Musk was born on June 28, 1971, inPretoria, South Africa.
[7]His mother isMaye Musk(néeHaldeman), a model and dietitian born inSaskatchewan, Canada,[8][9][10]but raised in South Africa. His father is Errol Musk, aWhite South Africanelectromechanical engineer, pilot, sailor, consultant, and property developer who was once a half-owner of aZambianemeraldmine nearLake Tanganyika.
[11][12]Musk has a younger brother,Kimbal(born 1972), and a younger sister,Tosca(born 1974).
[10][13]His maternal grandfather, Joshua Haldeman, was an adventurous American-born Canadian who took his family on record-breaking journeys in a single-engineBellancaairplane to Africa and Australia;[14][15][16]Musk has British andPennsylvania Dutchancestry.
[17][18]When Musk was a child, hisadenoidswere removed because doctors suspected that he wasdeaf, but his mother later decided that he was thinking "in another world."[19]The family was very wealthy in Elon's youth; Errol Musk once said, "We had so much money at times we couldn't even close our safe".
[12]Elon's father was also elected to the Pretoria City Council as a representative of the anti-apartheidProgressive Party, with the Musk children reportedly sharing their father's dislike ofapartheid.
[20]Musk decided not to participate in South Africa's mandatory military service because of the government's apartheid system.
[20]This also might have contributed to Musk's decision to leave South Africa shortly after graduating from high school.
[20]After his parents divorced in 1980, Musk mostly lived with his father in Pretoria and elsewhere,[17]a choice he made two years after the divorce and subsequently regretted.
[21]Musk has become estranged from his father, whom he describes as "a terrible human being... Almost every evil thing you could possibly think of, he has done."[21]He has a half-sister and a half-brother on his father's side.
[14][22]Elon attended an Anglican Sunday school in his youth.
[23]Around age 10, Musk developed an interest incomputingandvideo gamesand acquired aCommodore VIC-20.
[24][25]He learnedcomputer programmingusing a manual and, at age 12, sold the code of aBASIC-based video game he created calledBlastartoPC and Office Technologymagazine for approximately $500.
[26][27]An awkward and introverted child,[28]Musk was bullied throughout his childhood and was once hospitalized after a group of boys threw him down a flight of stairs.
[21][29]He attendedWaterkloof House Preparatory SchoolandBryanston High Schoolbefore graduating fromPretoria Boys High School.
[30]EducationAware that it would be easier to enter the United States from Canada,[31]Musk applied for a Canadian passport byjus sanguinis, through his Canadian-born mother.
[32][33]While awaiting the documentation, he attended theUniversity of Pretoriafor five months; this allowed him to avoid mandatory service in theSouth African military.
[34]Musk arrived in Canada in June 1989, and lived with a second cousin inSaskatchewanfor a year,[35]working odd jobs at a farm and lumber-mill.
[36]In 1990, he enteredQueen's UniversityinKingston, Ontario.
[37][38]Two years later, he transferred to theUniversity of Pennsylvania, where he graduated in 1997 with aBachelor of Artsdegree in physics and aBachelor of Sciencedegree in economics from theWharton School.
[39][40][41]In 1994, Musk held two internships inSilicon Valleyduring the summer: at energy storage startup Pinnacle Research Institute, which researched electrolyticultracapacitorsfor energy storage, and at the Palo Alto-based startupRocket Science Games.
[42]In 1995, he was accepted to aDoctor of Philosophy(Ph.D.) program inmaterials scienceatStanford Universityin California.
[43]Musk attempted to get a job atNetscapebut never received a response to his inquiries.
[32]He dropped out of Stanford after two days, deciding instead to join theInternet boomand launch an Internet startup.
[44]Business careerZip2In 1995, Musk, his brother Kimbal, and Greg Kouri founded web software companyZip2with funds borrowed from Musk's father.
[45][21]They housed the venture at a small rented office in Palo Alto.
[46]The company developed and marketed an Internet city guide for the newspaper publishing industry, with maps, directions, and yellow pages.
[47]Musk says that before the company became successful, he could not afford an apartment and instead rented an office and slept on the couch and showered at theYMCA, and shared one computer with his brother.
[48]According to Musk, "The website was up during the day and I was coding it at night, seven days a week, all the time."[46]The Musk brothers obtained contracts withThe New York Timesand theChicago Tribune,[49]and persuaded the board of directors to abandon plans for a merger withCitySearch.
[50]Musk's attempts to become CEO, a position held by its Chairman Rich Sorkin,[51]were thwarted by the board.
[52]Compaqacquired Zip2 for $307 million in cash in February 1999,[53][54]and Musk received $22 million for his 7-percent share.
[55][56]X.com and PayPalIn 1999, Musk co-foundedX.com, an online financial services ande-mailpayment company.
[57]The startup was one of the firstfederally insuredonline banks, and, in its initial months of operation, over 200,000 customers joined the service.
[58]The company's investors regarded Musk as inexperienced and had him replaced withIntuitCEO Bill Harris by the end of the year.
[59]The following year, X.com merged with online bankConfinityto avoid competition.
[46][59][60]Founded byMax LevchinandPeter Thiel,[61]Confinity had its own money-transfer service,PayPal, which was more popular than X.com's service.
[55][62]Within the merged company, Musk returned as CEO. Musk's preference forMicrosoftsoftware overUnixcreated a rift in the company and caused Thiel to resign.
[63]Due to resulting technological issues and lack of a cohesive business model, the board ousted Musk and replaced him with Thiel in September 2000.
[64][b]Under Thiel, the company focused on the PayPal service and was renamed PayPal in 2001.
[66][67]In 2002 PayPal was acquired byeBayfor $1.5 billion in stock, of which Musk—the largestshareholderwith 11.72% of shares—received $175.8 million.
[68][69]In 2017 Musk purchased the domain X.com from PayPal for an undisclosed amount, explaining it has sentimental value.
[70][71]SpaceXIn 2001 Musk became involved with the nonprofitMars Society. He was inspired by plans to place a growth-chamber for plants onMarsand discussed funding the project himself.
[72]In October 2001, Musk traveled toMoscowwithJim CantrellandMike Griffinto buy refurbishedIntercontinental ballistic missiles(ICBMs) that could send the greenhouse payloads into space. He met with companiesNPO LavochkinandKosmotras; however, Musk was seen as a novice and was even spat on by one of the Russian chief designers.
[73]The group returned to the United States empty-handed. In February 2002, the group returned to Russia to look for three ICBMs. They had another meeting with Kosmotras and were offered one rocket for $8 million, which Musk rejected. Musk instead decided to start a company that could build affordable rockets.
[73]With $100 million of his early fortune,[74]Musk founded Space Exploration Technologies Corp., traded asSpaceX, in May 2002.
[75]As of 2021, he remains the company's CEO and also holds the title of Chief Engineer.
[76]SpaceX attempted its first launch of theFalcon 1rocket in 2006,[77]and although the rocket failed to reachEarth orbit, it was awarded aCommercial Orbital Transportation Servicesprogram contract fromNASAlater that year.
[78]After two more failed attempts, which reportedly caused Musk so much stress that he was "waking from nightmares, screaming and in physical pain",[79]SpaceX succeeded in launching the Falcon 1 into orbit in 2008, making it the first private liquid-fuel rocket to do so.
[80]Later that year, SpaceX received a $1.6 billionCommercial Resupply Servicesprogram contract fromNASAfor 12 flights of itsFalcon 9rocket andDragon spacecraftto theInternational Space Station, replacing theSpace Shuttleafter its 2011 retirement.
[81]In 2012 the Dragon vehicle berthedwith the ISS, a first for a private enterprise.
[82]Working towards its goal ofreusable rockets, in 2015 SpaceX successfully landed the first stage of a Falcon 9.
[83]Landings were later achieved on anautonomous spaceport drone ship, an ocean-based recovery platform.
[84]In 2018 SpaceX launched theFalcon Heavy; theinaugural missioncarried Musk's personalTesla Roadsteras adummy payload.
[85][86]In 2017 SpaceX unveiled its next-generation launch vehicle and spacecraft system, Big Falcon Rocket, later renamed toStarship, which would support all SpaceXlaunch service providercapabilities.
[87]In 2018 SpaceX announced a planned 2023 lunar circumnavigation mission, a private flight calleddearMoon project.
[88]In 2020 SpaceX launched its first crewed flight, theDemo-2, becoming the first private company to place a person into orbit and dock a crewed spacecraft with the ISS.
[89]SpaceX began development of theStarlinkconstellation of low Earth orbit satellites in 2015 to providesatellite Internet access,[90]with the first two prototype satellites launched in February 2018. A second set of test satellites and the first large deployment of a piece of the constellation occurred in May 2019, when the first 60 operational satellites were launched.
[91]The total cost of the decade-long project to design, build, and deploy the constellation is estimated by SpaceX to be about $10 billion.
[92][c]The company has attractedcriticismfrom astronomers who say Starlink's satellites areblocking the viewof the skies, and from experts arguing that they risk colliding and causing dangers in space.
[95][96]Musk rejected the criticism, stating that the impact of satellites is "nothing" and that "space is just extremely enormous, and satellites are very tiny."[95]TeslaTesla, Inc.—originally Tesla Motors—was incorporated in July 2003 byMartin EberhardandMarc Tarpenning, who financed the company until theSeries A roundof funding.
[97]Both men played active roles in the company's early development prior to Musk's involvement.
[98]Musk led the Series A round of investment in February 2004; he invested $6.5 million, became the majority shareholder, and joined Tesla's board of directors as chairman.
[99][100]Musk took an active role within the company and oversawRoadsterproduct design but was not deeply involved in day-to-day business operations.
[101]Following a series of escalating conflicts in 2007 and the2008 financial crisis, Eberhard was ousted from the firm.
[102][103]Musk assumed leadership of the company as CEO and product architect in 2008.
[104]A 2009 lawsuit settlement with Eberhard designated Musk as a Tesla co-founder, along with Tarpenning and two others.
[105][106]As of 2019, Elon Musk was the longest tenured CEO of any automotive manufacturer globally.
[107]In 2021 Musk nominally changed his title to "Technoking" while retaining his position as CEO.
[108]Tesla first built an electric sports car, the Roadster, in 2008. With sales of about 2,500 vehicles, it was the firstserial productionall-electric car to uselithium-ion batterycells.
[109]Tesla began delivery of its four-doorModel Ssedan in 2012;[110]a cross-over, theModel Xwas launched in 2015.
[111][112]A mass market sedan, theModel 3, was released in 2017.
[113][114]The Model 3 is the all-time best-selling plug-in electric car worldwide, and, in June 2021, became the first electric car to sell 1 million units globally.
[115][116]A fifth vehicle, theModel Ycrossover, was launched in 2020.
[117]TheCybertruck, an all-electric pickup truck, was unveiled in 2019.
[118]Under Musk, Tesla has also constructed multiple lithium-ion battery and electric vehicle factories, such asGigafactory 1in Nevada,Gigafactory 2in New York,Gigafactory 3in China,Gigafactory 4in Germany andGigafactory 5in Texas.
[119][120][121][122][123][124]Since itsinitial public offeringin 2010,[125]Tesla stock has risen significantly; it became the most valuable carmaker in summer 2020,[126][127]and it entered theS&P 500later that year.
[128][129]In October 2021 it reached a market capitalization of $1 trillion, the sixth company to do so in US history.
[130]On November 6, 2021, Musk proposed onTwitterselling 10% of his Tesla stock, since "much is made lately of unrealized gains being a means of tax avoidance".
[131][132]After more than 3.5 million Twitter accounts supported the sale, Musk sold $6.9 billion of Tesla stock in the week ending November 12,[131]and a total of $16.4 billion by year end, reaching the 10% target.
[133]In February 2022,The Wall Street Journalreported that both Elon and Kimbal Musk were under investigation by the SEC for possible insider trading related to the sale.
[134]SEC lawsuitIn September 2018, Musk wassuedby the SEC[135]for atweetclaiming funding had been secured for potentially taking Teslaprivate.
[136][d]The lawsuit characterized the tweet as false, misleading, and damaging to investors, and sought to bar Musk from serving as CEO ofpublicly traded companies.
[136][140][141]Two days later, Musk settled with the SEC, without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations. As a result, Musk and Tesla were fined $20 million each, and Musk was forced to step down for three years as Tesla chairman but was able to remain as CEO.
[142][143]Musk has stated in interviews he does not regret posting the tweet that triggered the SEC investigation.
[144][145]On February 19, 2019, Musk stated in a tweet that Tesla would build half a million cars in 2019.
[146]The SEC reacted to Musk's tweet by filing in court, initially asking the court to hold him in contempt for violating the terms of a settlement agreement with such a tweet, which was disputed by Musk. This was eventually settled by a joint agreement between Musk and the SEC clarifying the previous agreement details.
[147]The agreement included a list of topics that Musk would need preclearance before tweeting about.
[148]In May 2020, a judge prevented a lawsuit from proceeding that claimed a tweet by Musk regarding Tesla stock price ("too highimo") violated the agreement.
[149][150]FOIAreleased records showing that the SEC itself concluded Musk has subsequently violated the agreement twice by tweeting regarding "Tesla's solar roof production volumes and its stock price".
[151]SolarCity and Tesla EnergyMusk provided the initial concept and financial capital forSolarCity, which his cousinsLyndonand Peter Rive co-founded in 2006.
[152]By 2013, SolarCity was the second largest provider of solar power systems in the United States.
[153]In 2014 Musk promoted the idea of SolarCity building an advanced production facility inBuffalo, New York, triple the size of the largest solar plant in the United States.
[154]Construction on thefactorystarted in 2014 and was completed in 2017. It operated as a joint venture withPanasonicuntil early 2020 when Panasonic departed.
[155][156]Tesla acquired SolarCity for over $2 billion in 2016 and merged it with its battery energy storage products division to createTesla Energy.
NeuralinkIn 2016 Musk co-founded Neuralink, aneurotechnologystartup company to integrate the human brain withartificial intelligence(AI) by creating devices that are embedded in the human brain to facilitate its merging with machines. The devices will also reconcile with the latest improvements in AI to stay updated. Such improvements could enhance memory or allow the devices to communicate with software more effectively.
[157][158]At a live demonstration in August 2020, Musk described one of their early devices as "a Fitbit in your skull" that could soon cure paralysis, deafness, blindness, and other disabilities. Many neuroscientists and publications criticized these claims;[159][160][161]MIT Technology Reviewdescribed them as "highly speculative" and "neuroscience theater".
[159]On the other hand, biomedical engineer Peter Bannister has defended Musk's sci-fi–inspired rhetorical overreach as inspirational for aspiring engineers and scientists.
[162]The Boring CompanyIn 2016, Musk foundedThe Boring Companyto construct tunnels.
[163]In early 2017, the company began discussions withregulatory bodiesand initiated construction of a 30-foot (9.1 m) wide, 50-foot (15 m) long, and 15-foot (4.6 m) deep "test trench" on the premises of SpaceX's offices as it required no permits.
[164]A tunnel beneath theLas Vegas Convention Centerwas completed in early 2021.
[165]Local officials have approved further expansions of the tunnel system.
[166]As a merchandising and publicity stunt, The Boring Company sold 2,000 noveltyflamethrowersin 2018.
[167][168]The idea, and his fascination with the idea of a flamethrower in general, was inspired by theMel Brooks-directed filmSpaceballs(1987), something confirmed in thedocumentary filmReturn to Space, directed byElizabeth Chai VasarhelyiandJimmy Chin.
[169][170]Managerial style and treatment of employeesMusk's managerial style and treatment of his employees have been heavily criticized.
[171][172][173][174][175][176]Business Insiderreported that Tesla employees were told not to walk past Musk's desk because of his "wild firing rampages".
[177]The Wall Street Journalreported that, after Musk insisted on branding his vehicles as "self-driving", he faced criticism from his engineers, some of whom resigned in response, with one stating that Musk's "reckless decision making... ha[d] potentially put customer lives at risk".
[178]The 2021 bookPower Playcontains multiple anecdotes of Musk berating employees.
[179]The New York Timescharacterized Musk's managerial style as impetuous, operating on impulse and "the belief that he is absolutely right".
[180]Other activitiesHyperloopIn 2013 Musk announced plans for a version of avactrain(or vacuum tube train), assigning a dozen engineers fromTeslaandSpaceXto establish the conceptual foundations and create initial designs.
[181]On August 12, 2013, Musk unveiled the concept, which he dubbed the Hyperloop.
[182]The alpha design for the system was published in awhitepaperposted to the Tesla and SpaceX blogs.
[183]The document scoped out the technology and outlined a notional route where such a transport system could be built between theGreater Los Angeles Areaand theSan Francisco Bay Areaat an estimated total cost of $6 billion.
[184]The proposal, if technologically feasible at the costs he has cited, would make Hyperloop travel cheaper than any othermode of transportfor such long distances.
[185]In June 2015, Musk announced adesign competitionfor students and others to build Hyperloop pods to operate on a SpaceX-sponsored mile-long track in a 2015–2017Hyperloop pod competition. The track was used in January 2017, and Musk also announced that the company started a tunnel project with Hawthorne airport as its destination.
[186]In July 2017, Musk claimed that he had received "verbal government approval" to build a hyperloop fromNew York CitytoWashington, D.C.
, stopping in bothPhiladelphiaandBaltimore.
[187]Mention of the project for the DC to Baltimore part were removed from the Boring Company website later in 2021.
[188]OpenAIIn December 2015, Musk announced the creation ofOpenAI, a not-for-profitAIresearch company aiming to developartificial general intelligenceintended to be safe and beneficial to humanity.
[189]A particular focus of the company is to "counteract large corporations [and governments] who may gain too much power by owning super-intelligence systems".
[190][21]In 2018 Musk left the OpenAI board to avoid possible future conflicts with his role as CEO of Tesla as the company increasingly became involved in AI throughTesla Autopilot.
[191]Tham Luang cave rescue and defamation caseIn July 2018, Musk arranged for his employees to build a mini-submarine to assist therescueof children stuck in a flooded cavern inThailand.
[192]Richard Stanton, leader of the international rescue diving team, urged Musk to facilitate the construction of the vehicle as a back-up, in case flooding worsened.
[193][194]Engineers at SpaceX and The Boring Company built the mini-submarine out of aFalcon 9liquid oxygen transfer tube[195]in eight hours and personally delivered it to Thailand.
[196]By this time, however, eight of the 12 children had already been rescued using full face masks and oxygen under anesthesia; consequently Thai authorities declined to use the submarine.
[192]Elon Musk was later one of the 187 people who received various honors conferred by theKing of Thailandin March 2019 for involvement in the rescue effort, e.g. theOrder of the Direkgunabhorn.
[197][198]Soon after the rescue, Vernon Unsworth, a British recreational caver who had been exploring the cave for the previous six years and played a key advisory role in the operation, criticized the submarine onCNNas amounting to nothing more than a public relations effort with no chance of success, and that Musk "had no conception of what the cave passage was like" and "can stick his submarine where it hurts". Musk asserted on Twitter that the device would have worked and referred to Unsworth as a "pedo guy".
[199]He deleted the tweets, along with an earlier tweet in which he told another critic of the device "Stay tuned jackass",[199]and apologized.
[200][201]In an email toBuzzFeed NewsMusk later baselessly called Unsworth a "child rapist" and said that he had married a child.
[202][203][204]In September, Unsworth filed a defamation suit in Los Angeles federal court.
[205][206]In his defense, Musk argued that"'pedo guy' was a common insult used in South Africa when I was growing up ... synonymous with 'creepy old man' and is used to insult a person's appearance and demeanor".
[207]The defamation case began in December 2019, with Unsworth seeking $190 million in damages.
[208]During the trial Musk apologized to Unsworth again for the tweet. On December 6, the jury found in favor of Musk and ruled he was not liable.
[209][210]2018 Joe Rogan podcast appearanceOn September 6, 2018, Musk appeared onThe Joe Rogan Experiencepodcast and discussed various topics for over two hours. During the interview, Musk sampled a single puff from a cigar consisting,Joe Roganclaimed, of tobacco laced with cannabis. Tesla stock dropped after the incident, which coincided with the confirmation of the departure of Tesla's vice president of worldwide finance earlier that day.
[211][212]Fortunewondered if the cannabis use could have ramifications for SpaceX contracts with theUnited States Air Force, though an Air Force spokesperson toldThe Vergethat there was no investigation and that the Air Force was still processing the situation.
[213][214]In a60 Minutesinterview, Musk said of the incident: "I do not smoke pot. As anybody who watched that podcast could tell, I have no idea how to smoke pot."[215][216]Music venturesOn March 30, 2019, Musk released araptrack, "RIP Harambe", onSoundCloudas Emo G Records. The track, which is an allusion to the killing ofHarambe, a gorilla in a Cincinnati zoo, and the subsequent "tasteless"Internet sensationalismsurrounding the event, was performed by Yung Jake, written by Yung Jake andCaroline Polachek, and produced byBloodPop.
[217][218]On January 30, 2020, Musk released anEDMtrack, "Don't Doubt Ur Vibe", featuring his own lyrics and vocals.
[219]WhileThe GuardiancriticAlexi Petridisdescribed it as "indistinguishable... from umpteen competent but unthrilling bits of bedroom electronica posted elsewhere on Soundcloud",[220]TechCrunchsaid it was "not a bad representation of the genre".
[219]Donations and non-profitsIn 2012 Musk took theGiving Pledge, thereby committing to give the majority ofhis wealthto charitable causes either during his lifetimes or in his will.
[221]In 2014 Musk donated $1 million to a museum dedicated to Nikola Tesla.
[222]In 2020Forbesgave Musk a philanthropy score of 1, because he had given away less than 1% of his net worth.
[223]In November 2021, Musk donated $5.7 billion of Tesla's shares to charity.
[224]He has endowed prizes at theX Prize Foundation, including $15million to encourage innovation in addressing illiteracy and $100million to reward improvedcarbon capturetechnology.
[225][226][227][228]After the2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Musk facilitated sending Starlink systems purchased by other European nations and private funding to Ukraine for internet access and communication in the besieged country.
[229]Ukrainian presidentVolodymyr Zelenskyythanked Musk personally for the support of Ukraine and announced further talks between the two about space projects to take place after the war.
[230][231]Musk FoundationMusk is president of the Musk Foundation,[232]which states its purpose is to provide solar-power energy systems in disaster areas as well as to support research, development and advocacy (for such areas as human space exploration, pediatrics, renewable energy and "safe artificial intelligence"), and science and engineering educational goals.
[233][234]Since 2002, the foundation has made over 350 contributions. Around half were to scientific research or education nonprofits. Notable beneficiaries include theWikimedia Foundation, his alma mater the University of Pennsylvania, and Kimbal'sBig Green.
[223]Voxdescribed the foundation as "almost entertaining in its simplicity and yet is strikingly opaque", noting that its website was only 33 words in plain-text.
[235]The foundation has been criticized for the relatively small amount of wealth donated.
[236]From 2002 to 2018, it gave out $25 million directly tonon-profits, nearly half of which went to Musk's OpenAI,[235]which was at the time a non-profit organization.
[237]TwitterMusk is an active user of the social media platformTwitter, where he has over 91 million followers.
[238]Musk made the first tweet on his personal account in June 2010.
[239][240]He posts memes, promotes his business interests and sometimes comments on contemporary political and cultural issues.
[241]Musk has faced some controversy as a result of his use of the platform. In August 2018, he claimed in a tweet that he was taking Tesla private at $420 per share,a joking reference to marijuana. An SEC investigation concluded that the tweets had no basis in fact and hurt investors, resulting in separate fines to Musk and Tesla of $20 million each. The settlement also included a clause that Musk would have legal counsel approve tweets about Tesla in advance. In 2022 he was also sued by Tesla shareholders over the tweet. Musk maintains that the joke was "worth it".
[242]In 2020, a tweet by Musk stating that "Tesla stock price is too high" reduced the company's value by $14 billion. Musk encountered further troubles in 2021, when he tweeted a poll about whether to sell 10% of his stock in the company, before doing so. This resulted in an SEC insider trading investigation into Musk and his brother Kimbal, relating to whether Musk told his brother in advance that he would tweet the poll.
[242]Other points of controversy have included his tweets aboutcryptocurrencysuch asDogecoinandEthereum, which have caused their values to fluctuate,[243][244]as well as tweets downplaying the severity of COVID-19 and criticizing lockdowns, including one comparing Canadian prime ministerJustin Trudeauto Hitler over vaccine mandates.
[242]Musk tweeted as early as 2017 expressing interest in buying the platform.
[242]On January 31, 2022, Musk began steadily buying significant quantities of shares in the company, reaching a 5% stake in the company on March 14, 2022.
[245]Musk reached a total of 73,115,038 shares on April 1, 9.13% of Twitter's overall shares, valued at the time at $2.64 billion, making him the largest shareholder in the company. It is alleged that Musk did not file the necessary paperwork to notify the SEC within 10 days of when his stake in the company surpassed 5%, a violation of US securities laws.
[246]When Musk publicly disclosed his investment in aSecurities and Exchange Commission13G filingon April 4, 2022, Twitter shares experienced the largest intraday surge since its IPO in 2013 as a flurry of trading activity resulted in the share price increasing by as much as 27%.
[238]The revelation that Musk had acquired a significant stake in Twitter followed Musk's tweets on March 25 and 26 in which he questioned Twitter's commitment tofreedom of speechand said that he was considering developing a rival social media site,[247][248][249]although the comments were made after he had already acquired 7.5% of the company.
[245][250]On April 4, Musk agreed to a deal that would see him appointed to Twitter's board of directors and prohibit him from acquiring more than 14.9% of the company,[251][252]but Musk decided not to join the board before his appointment became effective on April 9.
[253]On April 13, Musk made a $43 billion offer to buy Twitter, launching a takeover bid to buy 100% of Twitter's stock at $54.20 per share. In a letter to Twitter's board, he indicated his desire to take the company private: "[Twitter] will neither thrive nor serve [itsfree speech] societal imperative in its current form. Twitter needs to be transformed as a private company."[254][255][256]In response, Twitter's board adopted ashareholder rights planto make it significantly more expensive for any single investor to own more than 15% of the company without approval of the board.
[257][258]In aTEDinterview, Musk showed little interest in fightinginternet censorshiparound the world, saying that "Twitter should match the laws of the country". Instead, Musk's concern about free speech has been directed almost entirely at Twitter'smoderationpolicies.
[259][260]On April 20, Musk secured funding worth $46.5 billion.
[261]The funding included $12.5 billion in loans against Musk's stock inTesla, and $21 billion in equity financing, such as from selling Tesla shares.
[262][263]On April 25, it was reported that Twitter was prepared to accept Musk's offer.
[264]Later that same day, Elon Musk successfully concluded his bid to buy Twitter and bring the companyprivatefor approximately $44 billion.
[265][266][267]In a statement, Musk said:[268][269].mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0}Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated, I also want to make Twitter better than ever by enhancing the product with new features, making the algorithms open source to increase trust, defeating the spam bots, and authenticating all humans. Twitter has tremendous potential—I look forward to working with the company and the community of users to unlock it.
[270][271]Tesla's stock market value sank by more than $125 billion the next day in reaction to the deal, causing Musk to lose around $30 billion of his net worth.
[272][273]He subsequently tweeted criticism of Twitter executiveVijaya Gadde's policies to his 86 million followers, which led to some of them engaging in sexist and racist harassment against her.
[274]On May 13, Musk stated that the deal had been put "on hold" following a report that 5 percent of Twitter's daily active users were spam accounts,[275]causing Twitter shares to drop more than 10 percent.
[276]Musk later clarified that he remained committed to the acquisition,[277]and Agrawal stated that he expected the deal to close.
[278]WealthMusk made $175.8 million when PayPal was sold to eBay in 2002.
[279]He was first listed on theForbesBillionaires Listin 2012, with a net worth of $2 billion.
[280]At the start of 2020, Musk had a net worth of $27 billion.
[281]By the year's end his net worth had increased by $150 billion, largely driven by his ownership of around 20% of Tesla stock.
[282]During this, Musk's net worth was often volatile. For example, it dropped $16.3 billion in September, the largest single-day plunge in the history of theBloomberg Billionaires Index.
[283]In November of that year, Musk passedFacebookco-founderMark Zuckerbergto become the third-richest person in the world; a week later he passedMicrosoftco-founderBill Gatesto become the second-richest.
[284]In January 2021, Musk, with a net worth of $185 billion, surpassedAmazonfounderJeff Bezosto become the richest person in the world.
[285]Bezos reclaimed the top spot the following month.
[286]On September 27, 2021, Forbes announced that Musk had a net worth of over $200 billion, and was the richest person in the world, after Tesla stock surged.
[287]In November 2021, Musk became the first person with a net worth over $300 billion.
[288]Around three-quarters of Musk's wealth derives from Tesla.
[284]Musk does not receive a salary from Tesla; he agreed in 2018 to a compensation plan with the board that ties his personal earnings to Tesla's valuation and revenue.
[282]The deal stipulated that Musk only receives the compensation if Tesla reaches certain market values.
[289]It was the largest such deal ever done between a CEO and board.
[290]In the first award, given in May 2020, he was eligible to purchase 1.69 million TSLA shares (about 1% of the company) at below-market prices, which was worth about $800 million.
[290][289]Musk paid $455 million in taxes on $1.52 billion of income between 2014 and 2018.
[291]According toProPublica, Musk paid no federal income taxes in 2018.
[292]His 2021 tax bill was estimated at $12 billion based on his sale of $14 billion worth of Tesla stock.
[291]Musk has repeatedly described himself as "cash poor",[293][294]and has "professed to have little interest in the material trappings of wealth".
[293]In 2012, Musk signedThe Giving Pledgeand, in May 2020, pledged to "sell almost all physical possessions".
[294][295]In 2021 Musk defended his wealth by saying he is "accumulating resources to help make life multiplanetary [and] extend the light of consciousness to the stars".
[296]In the early 2000s, Musk was[clarification needed]a private pilot, his favorite aircraft then being theL-39 Albatros, though he decided to stop piloting by 2008.
[297][298]He uses a private jet owned by SpaceX[299][300]and acquired a second jet in August 2020.
[301]The jet's heavy use offossil fuels—it flew over 150,000 miles in 2018—has received criticism.
[299][302]ViewsUnited States politicsIn 2015, Musk stated he donates to both Democrats and Republicans, and that financial political contributions are a requirement to have a voice in the United States government.
[303]In September 2021, following the adoption ofTexas' strictabortionrestrictions, Texas GovernorGreg Abbottstated that Musk and SpaceX supported Texas' "social policies". In response, Musk stated, "In general, I believe government should rarely impose its will upon the people, and, when doing so, should aspire to maximize their cumulative happiness. That said, I would prefer to stay out of politics."[304]Musk reacted to a Democratic proposal totax the wealth of billionairesby both criticizing the proposed policy and responding with a vulgar insult to SenatorRon Wyden.
[305][306]In November 2021, Musk was criticized after mocking SenatorBernie Sanderson Twitter. Sanders posted a message on Twitter demanding that the extremely wealthy pay their fair share of taxes, and Musk replied: "I keep forgetting that you're still alive."[307][308][309]In May 2022, Musk stated that he intends to vote Republican "this election"; it was unclear if Musk was referring to the2022 U.S. electionsor the2024 U.S. presidential election.
[310][311]Historically, in the2020 Democratic presidential primaries, Musk had endorsed candidateAndrew Yangand expressed support for his proposeduniversal basic income.
[312]He had also endorsedKanye West'sindependent campaign in the general election.
[313]COVID-19Based on current trends, probably close to zero new cases in US too by end of AprilMarch 19, 2020[314]Musk was criticized for his public comments and conduct related to theCOVID-19 pandemic.
[315][316]He spreadmisinformation about the virus, includingpromoting chloroquineand assuming that death statistics were manipulated.
[317][318][319][320][321]In March 2020, Musk stated, "The coronavirus panic is dumb."[322][323]In an email to Tesla employees, Musk referred toCOVID-19as a "specific form of thecommon cold" and guessed that confirmed COVID-19 cases would not exceed 0.1% (one tenth of a percent) of the US population.
[324]On March 19, 2020, Musk predicted that there would be "probably close to zero new cases in [the US] by end of April".
[325][326]Politicolater labeled this statement one of "the most audacious, confident and spectacularly incorrect prognostications [of 2020]".
[327]Musk also claimedincorrectlythat children "are essentially immune" to COVID-19.
[328][329]Twitter determined that the Tweet did not break their rules on COVID-19 commentary; the decision was described as "irresponsible" byThe Verge.
[330]Musk repeatedly criticizedCOVID-19 lockdowns.
[331]He refused to close theTesla Fremont factoryin March 2020, defying the localshelter-in-placeorder,[332][333]and reopened it again in May 2020, defying the localstay-at-home order.
[334][335]Musk warned Tesla workers that they would be unpaid and theirpandemic unemployment benefitsmight be jeopardized if they did not report to work for the May 2020 factory reopening.
[335]In March 2020, in response to a request to repurpose the Tesla factory to makeurgently-needed ventilators, Musk tweeted, "We will makeventilatorsif there is a shortage."[336][337]WhenNate Silverresponded, "There's a shortage now, how many ventilators you making @elonmusk?",[338]Musk replied, "Ventilators are not difficult, but cannot be produced instantly. Which hospitals have these shortages you speak of right now?"[336]New York City mayorBill de Blasiotweeted at Musk about the drastic ventilator shortage inNew York Cityhospitals, and informed him that his office would reach out to him directly.
[339]A week later, Musk offered to donate ventilators which Tesla would build or buy from a third party.
[340]Musk eventually purchased and donated medical devices that multiple hospitals noted wereBiPAPandCPAP machines, not the much more expensive and sought-after invasive mechanical ventilator (IMV) machines. However, these other devices could still be used to free up ventilators for the sickest patients.
[341][342][343]Invasive ventilators can cost up to $50,000, whereas CPAP machines can be purchased for around $500.
[344]In November 2020, the phrase "SpaceKaren"trended on Twitterin connection with Musk after he tweeted misinformation about the usefulness of theCOVID-19 rapid antigen test.
[345][346][347]In 2021, findings of anantibody-testingprogram that SpaceX worked with doctors and academic researchers to create were published inNature Communicationswith Musk listed as a co-author.
[348][349]Canada convoy protestOn January 27, 2022, Musk tweeted "Canadian truckers rule", endorsing theCanada convoy protest, branded as the "Freedom Convoy" by its organizers.
[350][351]Musk tweeted extensively in support of the protest, which began as a denunciation ofCOVID-19 vaccinemandates for truck drivers crossing theCanada-U.S. border, but morphed into being against COVID-19 restrictions in general and Canada'sLiberalgovernment.
[352]On February 16, 2022, apparently supporting the protest, Musk tweeted and later deleted a meme comparing Canadian prime ministerJustin TrudeautoAdolf Hitler. Trudeau's government had recently invoked theEmergencies Actto cut funding to the convoy protest, which was founded and internationally funded byfar-rightactivists.
[353][354]TheAuschwitz-Birkenau State Museumaccused Musk of exploiting the tragedy ofthe Holocaust, and theAmerican Jewish Committeecalled on Musk to apologize.
[355][356]Gender identityIn July 2020, Musk tweeted "Pronounssuck" to significant backlash on Twitter, including fromGrimes, his partner at the time.
[357][358][359]The tweet has been perceived by some astransphobicand an attack onnon-binarygender identities.
[360]In a series of December 2020 tweets, Musk again mocked the use of preferred gender pronouns. TheHuman Rights Campaign, which had previously given Tesla the number one ranking on itsCorporate Equality Index, criticized his tweets and called for an apology.
[361][362]Free speechIn 2022, Musk refused to blockRussian state mediaon SpaceX'sStarlinksatellites in response toRussia's invasion of Ukraine, identifying as "afree speechabsolutist."[363][364]On April 14, 2022, Musk made anoffer to buy Twitter, saying "I invested in Twitter as I believe in its potential to be the platform for free speech around the globe, and I believe free speech is a societal imperative for a functioningdemocracy".
[365]According to a May 2022Reutersreport, Musk's decision to accept "foreign governments hostile to free speech" as investors of his Twitter buyout may trigger aCommittee on Foreign Investment in the United Statesprobe into its potentialnational securityrisks. Musk's Twitter investorsSaudi Arabia'sPrince Alwaleed bin Talal,Qatar'ssovereign wealth fund, andChina'sBinancecould influence Twitter if given a seat on its board or through other means.
[366][367]In aTEDinterview, Musk showed little interest in fightinginternet censorshiparound the world, saying that "Twitter should match the laws of the country". Instead, Musk's concern about free speech has been directed almost entirely at Twitter'smoderationpolicies.
[368][369]Musk praisedDonald Trump'ssocial mediaplatformTruth Social, and stated that it "exists because Twitter censored free speech." Trump created thealt-techplatform after Twitter banned him for inciting violence following the2021 United States Capitol attack.
[370]On May 10, 2022, Musk called Twitter’s decision to ban Trump "morally wrong", and said that he will reverse Trump's ban when he buys Twitter.
[371]Public transportationDespiteThe Boring Company's involvement in building mass transit infrastructure, Musk, its founder, has criticizedpublic transportation.
[372][373]In December 2017, Musk criticized the crowding and inconvenience of public transport and promoted individualized transport (private vehicles).
[373][374]His comments have been called "elitist"[374]and have sparked widespread criticism from both transportation andurban planningexperts, who have pointed out that public transportation in denseurban areasis more economical, more energy efficient, and requires much less space than private cars.
[375][372][376]FinanceMusk has stated that he does not believe the US government should providesubsidiesto companies; instead they should use acarbon taxto discourage poor behavior.
[377][378]Musk says that thefree marketwould achieve the best solution, and that producing environmentally unfriendly vehicles should come with its own consequences.
[379]His stance has been called hypocritical as his businesses have received billions of dollars in subsidies.
[380][381]In addition, Tesla made large sums from government-initiated systems of zero emissions credits offered inCaliforniaand theUnited States federal level, which enabled improved initial consumer adoption of Tesla vehicles, as thetax creditsgiven by governments enabled Tesla'sbattery electric vehiclesto be price-competitive, in relative comparison with existing lower-pricedinternal combustion enginevehicles.
[382]Notably, Tesla generates a sizeable portion of its revenue from its sales ofcarbon creditsgranted to the company, by both theEuropean Union Emissions Trading Systemand theChinese national carbon trading scheme.
[383][384][385][386]In a December 2021 interview withChristian conservativesatirical websiteThe Babylon Bee, Musk lamented that it was "increasingly difficult to get things done" in California. Musk had sold enough to reach his goal of selling 10% of his shares in Tesla (then the world's most valuable car company), partially to pay taxes, and relocated his personal and Tesla'stax residencefromCaliforniatoTexasin order to avoidstate income tax. Musk said that "California used to be the land of opportunity and now it is... becoming more so the land of sort of overregulation, overlitigation, overtaxation."[387]In the same interview, he stated, "At its heartwokenessis divisive, exclusionary, and hateful. It basically gives mean people... a shield to be mean and cruel, armored in false virtue."[388]Musk, a longtime opponent ofshort-selling, has repeatedly criticized the practice and argued it should be illegal.
[389][390]Musk's opposition to short-selling has been speculated to stem from how short-sellers often organize and publishopposition researchabout the companies that they believe are currently overvalued.
[391]In early 2021, he encouraged theGameStop short squeeze.
[392][393]Musk has also regularly promotedcryptocurrencies, stating that he supports them over traditionalgovernment-issued fiat currencies.
[394]Given the volatile effects that his tweets about them have,[395]his statements around cryptocurrencies have been viewed as market manipulations by critics such asNouriel Roubini.
[396]Climate changeMusk criticizedDonald Trumpfor his stance onclimate change[397]and after joining Trump's two business advisory councils,[398][399]Musk resigned from both in June 2017 in protest against Trump's decision towithdraw the United Statesfrom theParis Agreement.
[400]TechnologyMusk has frequently spoken about theexistential danger of AIbeing the greatest threat to humanity.
[401][402]Musk's opinions about AI have provoked controversy and have been criticized by experts such asYann LeCun.
[403][404][405]Consequently, according to CNBC, Musk is "not always looked upon favorably" by the AI research community.
[403]Mark Zuckerberg has clashed with Musk on the issue, with Zuckerberg calling his warnings "pretty irresponsible".
[406][407][408]Musk claimed that humans are probablyliving in a computer simulation.
[409]According to his former partnerGrimes, Musk often wondered aloud and asked her, "Are you real? Or are we living in my memory, and you're like a synthesized companion?"[410]In December 2021, when prompted for his opinion about thevirtual reality-drivenmetaverse, Musk said that he was "unable to see a compelling metaverse situation" and further remarked that "I think we're far from disappearing into the metaverse. This sounds just kind of buzzword-y. ... Sure you can put a TV on your nose. I'm not sure that makes you 'in the metaverse'. ... I don't see someone strapping a frigging screen to their face all day and not wanting to ever leave. That seems—no way."[411][412]Global conflictsIn July 2020, after being asked on Twitter by a user who said that "it was not in the best interest of the people" for the "US government to organize acoupagainstEvo Morales" for Musk to "obtainlithium" fromBolivia, the businessman responded: "We will coup whoever we want! Deal with it." The tweet caused controversy and was later deleted.
[413][414]Musk condemned the2022 Russian invasion of Ukraineand announced measures to support Ukraine's defense, such as providing the country with freeStarlinkaccess, for which Ukrainian PresidentVolodymyr Zelenskyypersonally thanked Musk.
[415][416]Mars colonizationMusk has voiced concerns about humanpopulation decline,[417][418]saying that "Mars has zero human population. We need a lot of people to become a multiplanet civilization."[419]Speaking atThe Wall Street Journal's CEO Council session in December 2021, Musk stated that decliningbirth ratesand population is one of the biggestrisks to human civilization.
[420]Musk has stated that he thinks a theoretical government on Mars should bedirect democracy.
[421]Personal lifeFrom the early 2000s until late 2020, Musk resided in California where both Tesla and SpaceX were founded and where their headquarters are still located.
[422]In 2020, he moved to Texas, stating that California had become "complacent" with its economic success.
[422][423]While hostingSaturday Night Livein May 2021, Musk stated that he hasAsperger syndrome.
[424]Marriages, dating life, and childrenMusk met his first wife, Canadian authorJustine Wilson, while attending Queen's University, and they married in 2000.
[425]He contractedmalariain 2000 while on vacation in South Africa, and nearly died.
[426]In 2002, their first child, son Nevada Alexander Musk, died ofsudden infant death syndrome(SIDS) at the age of 10 weeks.
[427]After his death, the couple decided to useIVFto continue their family.
[428]Twins Xavier and Griffin were born in April 2004, followed by triplets Kai, Saxon, and Damian in 2006.
[428]The couple divorced in 2008 andshare custodyof their five sons.
[425][429][430]In 2008, Musk began dating English actressTalulah Riley.
[431]They married in September 2010 atDornoch Cathedralin Scotland.
[432][433]In 2012, he announced a divorce from Riley.
[434][435][436]In 2013, Musk and Riley remarried. In December 2014, he filed for a second divorce from Riley; however, the action was withdrawn.
[437]A second divorce was finalized in 2016.
[438]Musk then datedAmber Heardfor several months in 2017;[439][440]he had reportedly been pursuing her since 2012.
[440]Musk was later accused byJohnny Deppof having an affair with Heard while she was still married to Depp.
[441][442][443]Musk and Heard both denied the affair.
[444]In May 2018, Musk and Canadian musicianGrimesrevealed that they were dating.
[445][446][447]Grimes gave birth to their son in May 2020.
[448][449]According to Musk and Grimes, his name was"X Æ A-12"; however, the name would have violated California regulations as it contained characters that are not in the modern English alphabet,[450][451]and was then changed to"X Æ A-Xii". This drew more confusion, asÆis not a letter in the modern English alphabet.
[452]The child was eventually named"X AE A-XII"Musk, with "X" as afirst name,"AE A-XII"as amiddle name, and "Musk" assurname.
[453]Musk confirmed reports that the couple are "semi-separated" in September 2021; in an interview withTimein December 2021, he said he was single.
[454][455][456]In March 2022, Grimes said of her relationship with Musk: "I would probably refer to him as my boyfriend, but we're very fluid." She further revealed that their first daughter, Exa Dark Sideræl Musk, nicknamed Y, was born in December 2021 viasurrogate.
[2]Later that month, Grimes tweeted that she and Musk had broken up again "but he's my best friend and the love of my life."[457]Sexual misconduct allegationA May 2022 article fromBusiness Insideralleged that Musk engaged insexual misconductwith a SpaceX flight attendant in aprivate jetin 2016. It was also alleged that SpaceX paid the attendant $250,000 to settle the sexual misconduct allegation.
[458]Musk denied the accusations, calling them "wild". He said there was "a lot more to this story" and that "If I were inclined to engage in sexual harassment, this is unlikely to be the first time in my entire 30-year career that it comes to light". Musk accused the article fromBusiness Insiderof being a "politically motivated hit piece".
