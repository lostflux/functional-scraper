Here we demonstrate supramolecular chemistry-based bridging of two membranes leading to controlled fusion of exosomes that act as nanoreactors for effective biocatalytic cascades, with prolonged functionality inside of living cells. Exosome membrane proteins were chemically engineered with a catechol moiety to drive fusion by supramolecular complexation to bridge the membranes. This strategy successfully encapsulated multiple enzymes and assembled the minimal electron transport chain in the plasma membrane, leading to tuneable, enhanced catalytic cascade activity capable of ATP synthesis inside of tissue spheroids. This nanoreactor was functional for many hours after uptake into living cells, showed successful penetration into tissue spheroids and repaired the damaged region by supplying ATP, all of which represent an advance in the mimicking of nature’s own organelles.

Source dataExtended Data Fig. 8 Estimation of ATP.
(a)Estimation of ATP in FEx-1 nanoreactors by the luciferin-luciferase assay. A standard calibration curve was obtained by monitoring luminescence intensity (luciferin to oxy-luciferin) by varying the amount of ATP (0 to 1000 nM).
(b)Time-dependent changes in luminescence intensity were measured using the luciferin-luciferase assay by the treatment of FEx nanoreactors with DTT, glucose, or DTT-glucose. After the assembly of ATP synthase and bo3oxidase into the membranes of the FEx nanoreactors as energy modules, the electron transport chain was triggered by the addition of dithiothreitol (DTTred), which reduced coenzyme Q1(Q1H) to make it available to bo3oxidase and encapsulated GOx/HRP inside FEx-1 nanoreactors by addition of glucose.
(c)Estimation of ROS production during the functioning of FEx-1 nanoreactors inside living cells by using the ROS assay kit. A standard calibration curve was obtained by monitoring the fluorescence intensity of dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (excitation at 485 nm and emission at 535 nm) after treatment with varying concentrations oftert-butyl hydrogen peroxide (0 to 50 µM). These results demonstrate that the increase in ROS production was proportional to the increase in fluorescence intensity.
(d)MCF-10A cells were treated with different concentrations of FEx-1 nanoreactors (10, 50, and 80 µg/mL), and the fluorescence intensity of dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate was measured to calculate ROS levels.
(e)Schematic of controls for direct loading of the enzymes into exosomes. ATP production using the luciferin luciferase assay of different condition controls; control (only exosome), (A), (B), and FEx-1 after 3 h. In the first control (A), GOx, HRP, ATPsynthase, and bo3Oxidase were used all together to encapsulated inside the exosome. Their amount was quantified by BCA Protein Assay kit after removal of free enzymes by ultracentrifugation. In the second control (B), all the enzymes (GOx, HRP, ATPsynthase and bo3Oxidase) were encapsulated one by one after the other with each time washing between steps, respectively.
(f)Luminescence intensity of multi-enzyme cascade reaction to produce the bioenergy in only exosomes, (A), and (B). ATP production was measured by luciferin-luciferase assay. Data represent mean ± SD of n = 3 independent experiments; two-tailed unpaired Student’s t-test was used for comparing two groups.
