As such, auditees should identify NIH awards as part of the R&D cluster on the Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards (SEFA). The auditor should test NIH awards for compliance as instructed in Part V, Clusters of Programs. NIH recognizes that some awards may have another classification for purposes of indirect costs. The auditor is not required to report the disconnect (i.e., the award is classified as R&D for Federal Audit Requirement purposes but non-research for indirect cost rate purposes), unless the auditee is charging indirect costs at a rate other than the rate(s) specified in the award document(s). Carry over of an unobligated balance into the next budget period requires Grants Management Officer prior approval. This award is subject to the requirements of 2 CFR Part 25 for institutions to receive a Dun & Bradstreet Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number and maintain an active registration in the System for Award Management (SAM). Should a consortium/subaward be issued under this award, a DUNS requirement must be included. See http://qrants.nih.gov/qrants/policy/awardconditions.htm for the full NIH award term implementing this requirement and other additional information. This award has been assigned the Federal Award Identification Number (FAIN) U01Al151797. Recipients must document the assigned FAIN on each consortium/subaward issued under this award. Based on the project period start date of this project, this award is likely subject to the Transparency Act subaward and executive compensation reporting requirement of 2 CFR Part 170. There are conditions that may exclude this award; see http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/awardconditions.htm for additional award applicability information. In accordance with P.L. 110-161, compliance with the NIH Public Access Policy is now mandatory. For more information, see NOT-OD-08-033 and the Public Access website: http://publicaccess.nih.gov/.

Please be advised that changes in the use of a Select Agent will be considered a change in scope and require NIH awarding office prior approval. The approval is necessary for new select agent experiments as well as changes in on-going experiments that would require change in the biosafety plan and/or biosafety containment level. An approval to conduct a restricted experiment granted to an individual cannot be assumed an approval to other individuals who conduct the same restricted experiment as defined in the Select Agents Regulation 42 CFR Part 73, Section 13.b (http://www.selectagents.gov/Regulations.html). Highly Pathogenic Agent: NIAID defines a Highly Pathogenic Agent as an infectious Agent or Toxin that may warrant a biocontainment safety level of BSL3 or higher according to the current edition of the CDC/NIH Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (BMBL) (http://www.cdc.gov/OD/ohs/biosfty/bmbl5/bmbl5toc.htm). Research funded under this grant must adhere to the BMBL, including using the BM BL-recommended biocontainment level at a minimum. If your Institutional Biosafety Committee (or equivalent body) or designated institutional biosafety official recommend a higher biocontainment level, the highest recommended containment level must be used. When submitting future Progress Reports indicate at the beginning of the report: If no research with a Highly Pathogenic Agent or Select Agent has been performed or is planned to be performed under this grant. If your IBC or equivalent body or official has determined, for example, by conducting a risk assessment, that the work being planned or performed under this grant may be conducted at a biocontainment safety level that is lower than BSL3. If the work involves Select Agents and/or Highly Pathogenic Agents, also address the following points: Any changes in the use of the Agent(s) or Toxin(s) including its restricted experiments that have resulted in a change in the required biocontainment level, and any resultant change in location, if applicable, as determined by your IBC or equivalent body or official. If work with a new or additional Agent(s)/Toxin(s) is proposed in the upcoming project period, provide: STAFF CONT ACTS o A list of the new and/or additional Agent(s) that will be studied; o A description of the work that will be done with the Agent( s ), and whether or not the work is a restricted experiment; o The title and location for each biocontainment resource/facility, including the name of the organization that operates the facility, and the biocontainment level at which the work will be conducted, with documentation of approval by your IBC or equivalent body or official. It is important to note if the work is being done in a new location. The Grants Management Specialist is responsible for the negotiation, award and administration of this project and for interpretation of Grants Administration policies and provisions. The Program Official is responsible for the scientific, programmatic and technical aspects of this project. These individuals work together in overall project administration.

Received Date: 2019-06-28T16:02:40.000-04:00Contact PD/Pl: DASZAK, PETER PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Southeast Asia is one of the world's highest-risk EID hotspots, the origin of the SARS pandemic, Nipah virus, and repeated outbreaks of influenza. This is driven by high diversity of wildlife and rapidly expanding demography that brings human and wildlife populations closer. This proposal will launch the smerging !nfectious Diseases - ~outh .5.ast Asia Research Collaboration Hub (EID-SEARCH), a collaboration among leaders in emerging disease research in the USA, Thailand, Singapore and the 3 major Malaysian administrative regions. These researchers have networks that span >50 clinics, laboratories and research institutions across almost all SE Asian countries and will use the EID-SEARCH as an early warning system for outbreaks involving exchange of information, reagents, samples and technology, and a collaborative power�house for fundamental and translational research. The EID-SEARCH will also act as a significant asset to scale-up and deploy resources in the case of an outbreak in the region. This EIDRC will conduct research to: 1) Identify, characterize and rank spillover risk of high zoonotic potential viruses from wildlife, by analyzing previously-archived wildlife samples, conducting targeted wildlife surveillance, and using serology & PCR assays to identify novel viruses. These will be characterized to assess risk of spillover to people, and a series of in vitro (receptor binding, cell culture) and in vivo (humanized mouse and collaborative cross models) assays used to assess their potential to infect people and cause disease; 2) Collect samples and questionnaire data from human communities that live in EID hotspots and have high cultural and behavioral risk of animal exposure (e.g. wildlife hunting, bat guano collection). These will be tested with serological assays to identify evidence of novel virus spillover, and analyzed against metadata to identify key risk pathways for transmission; 3) Identify and characterize viral etiology of 'cryptic' outbreaks in clinical cohorts. We will conduct syndromic surveillance at clinics serving the populations in Aim 2, enroll patients with undiagnosed illness and symptoms consistent with emerging viral pathogens, and test samples with molecular and follow-up serological assays to identify causal links between these syndromes and novel viruses. This research will advance our understanding of the risk of novel viral emergence in a uniquely important region. It will also strengthen in-country research capacity by linking local infectious disease scientists with an international collaborative network that has proven capacity to conduct this work and produce significant findings. The large body of high impact collaborative research from this EIDRC leadership team provides proof-of-concept that EID-SEARCH has the background, collaborative network, experience, and skillset to act as a unique early warning system for novel EIDs of any etiology threatening to emerge in this hottest of the EID hotspots. Page 8 Project Summary/AbstractContact PD/Pl: DASZAK, PETER PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposed EID Research Center (EID-SEARCH) brings leaders in emerging disease research from the US, Thailand, Singapore and the 3 major Malaysian administrative regions together to build an early warning system to safeguard against pandemic disease threats. This team will identify novel viruses from Southeast Asian wildlife, characterize their capacity to infect and cause illness in people, and use serological assays of samples from people in rural communities with high wildlife contact to identify the background rate of exposure, and risk factors that drive this. They will conduct in-depth surveillance of clinical cohorts at hospitals serving these communities to examine if 'cryptic' outbreaks are caused by these novel agents, and to build significant capacity to rapidly detect and respond should there be a major outbreak of a virus in the region.

These facilities are a modern AAALC accredited, central animal tract of about CbH4> sq. ft. The animal care and use program is managed by the Department of Laboratory Animal Medicine which is directed by a veterinarian who is an ACLAM Diplomat and staffed with one other veterinarian, a graduate animal husbandryman, and about 30 technicians. National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratories (NEIDL), Boston, USA (Ors. Keusch and Corley) The National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratories (NEIDL) is housed on the Boston University Medical Campus within close proximity to the School of Medicine, School of Dental Medicine and School of Public Health and their associated research facilities, and Boston Medical Center, the principal teaching hospital for the medical school. The Medical Campus also houses major Core facilities and includes an extensive Animal Science Center which includes animal facilities for BSL-2 and BSL-1 animal work. In addition to Basic Sciences and Clinical Departments, the Medical Campus also includes the Center for Regenerative Medicine, the Center for Network Systems Biology, and the Clinical and Translational Science Center. The Boston University Medical Campus is a short shuttle bus ride from the Boston University Campus on the Charles River. The BU campus includes the School of Engineering and its Biomedical Engineering Department and its Biologic Design ("synthetic biology") group, and the Hariri Institute for Computing and Computational Science. Major research programs in the Department of Chemistry and the Department of Biology are also of importance to the goals of the NEIDL, as is the Bioinformatics Graduate Program which is managed from the Charles River Campus. Boston University is a highly interactive and collaborative environment which is supported by the University administration to ensure that artificial barriers to success are removed and do not hamper innovation in research. Office spaces for faculty and staff are integrated throughout the NEIDL. Most faculty have offices in administrative spaces adjacent to the BSL-2 laboratories. Administrative support is provided and is supported by the administrative infrastructure of the University. All offices are accessible in an environment secured via proximity card and iris scan access. Page 13 Facilities & Other ResourcesContact PD/Pl: DASZAK, PETER Information Technology Access All laboratories are serviced by the Boston University IS& T group, with the exception of those services that are uniquely required for work within the NEIDL and are managed by the IT Core staff dedicated to the NEIDL. This includes building automation systems and select agent inventory control which are managed in a safe and secure network environment. Computational resources for individual faculty and staff are augmented by the BU Shared Computing Cluster which is maintained by BU and its consortium in Holyoke, MA, site of the LEED Platinum certified MA Green High Performance Computing Center (MGHPCC). Two pairs of 10 Gigabit Ethernet network connections between the MGHPCC and the BU campus connect the two locations. The system currently includes over 2600 shared processors, over 5100 buy-in processors, a combined 244 GPUs, and petabytes of redundantly backed up storage. Facility security: The Public Safety Core supports the NEIDL's mission by providing a safe and secure environment with particular attention to risks, threats and vulnerabilities. Public Safety personnel are well trained in the intricacies of a secure site, criminal applications and a significant amount of training pertaining to safety, facilities, emergency preparedness and response, biosafety incidents, animal rights activism and coordinated notification and response of external local, state and federal responders. The Public Safety Core monitors and audits all areas of access, and manages personnel suitability on a continual basis to ensure regulations are adhered to, as well as 24/7 management of the environment with police-academy-trained officers. Core managerial staff have developed a comprehensive set of Public Safety Standard Operating Procedures, consistent with BU MC-wide policies and procedures, which meet and/or exceed all applicable federal, state, and local regulations (NIH, BMBL, OSHA, CDC, NRG, MWRA, DEP, BFD, etc). In addition, they manage the process of background checks (CORI) and drug screening for staff in order to ensure that recruitments are consistent with security requirements. Interfacing with other support offices at Boston University: The operational core services offered in the NEIDL benefit from the additional infrastructure on the Boston University Campus, which not only contribute significant expertise but also provide services that we do not need to duplicate. For example, the IT services in the NEIDL are supported by a large BU Information Services and Technology Team that insures expert IT services are provided, and we have in house IT experts who are also trained to work within the containment facilities. Similarly, our Environmental Health & Safety core is supported by a larger EH&S group within the University, and Emergency Response is supported by a University wide ER group which has long experience working with local, state, and national responders. The Community Relations Services are integrated with BU campus-wide services which include the Office of Government and Community Affairs, while our Occupational Medicine Program is supplemented by a larger Research Occupational Health Program at the University. Biological Sample Storage and Access The National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratories (NEIDL) is designed to provide safe working conditions for handling pathogens at every biosafety level, including biosafety level 2 (BSL-2; Cb><4> sq.ft.), BSL-3 CbH4 sq.ft.) and BSL-4 Cb><4> sq.ft.). This includes laboratories and animal facilities for infectious diseases research at all containment levels. BSL-2 spaces include imbedded cell culture and pathogen propagation suites as well as BSL-2+ laboratory suites that can be upgraded to BSL-3 as needed.

Personal Statement DEGREE COMPLETION DATE FIELD OF STUDY B.S. (hons) 07/1986 Zoology Ph.D. 03/1993 Infectious Diseases I have 20+ year's NIH-funded research experience on emerging viral zoonoses, and the scientific skills to manage this proposed work that involves a large international collaboration on human and wildlife surveillance, and translational research. I am President and Chief Scientist of EcoHealth Alliance, a US-based 501 (c) 3 institution that conducts research on emerging zoonoses. My research background is focused on understanding the process of zoonotic disease emergence, particularly viral zoonoses. This includes identifying the bat origin of SARS-CoV and SADS-CoV, analyzing the causes of West Nile, Nipah and Hendra virus emergence and spread, publishing the first unbiased analysis of global emerging disease hotspots, and analyzing patterns of viral spillover into human populations in EID hotspots. I have been the Pl on 5 multidisciplinary R01 s, all with international collaborating organizations, including most on the current proposal. All of these used modeling, epidemiology, laboratory and field science to test hypotheses on the emergence of wildlife-origin viral zoonoses, including SARS-CoV, Nipah and Hendra virus, Avian influenza and bat-origin viruses. I have also led large contracts from USAID (institutional lead on $75 million PREDICT-1 and $138 million PREDICT-2; Chief-of-Party on $3 million IDEEAL), successfully managing teams of virologists, field biologists, mathematical modelers, veterinarians, epidemiologists, laboratorians and anthropologists. 1.

Numerous high impact emerging viruses appear to have bat reservoirs (e.g. SARS-CoV, EBOV, NiV, HeV, MERS-CoV, SADS-CoV). As Pl on five R01s on bat-origin viruses, my work has helped demonstrate the bat origin of SARS- and SADS-CoV, analyze the drivers of bat viral emergence and risk factors for spillover. Collaborating with virologists in China, we have isolated and characterized SARSr-CoVs from bats that use the same human host cell receptor (ACE-2) as SARS-CoV. This work provides critical reagents and resources that have helped advance understanding of virus-host binding and may contribute to vaccine development. My other work identified factors leading to the emergence of NiV from Pteropus bats in Malaysia and Bangladesh; a likely bat origin for MERS-CoV; and proof that bats harbor a significantly higher proportion of zoonoses than all other mammalian groups. a.

Emerging infectious diseases are a significant threat to global health. However, their emergence is sporadic, and involves a complex process that is hard to predict. In the early 2000s I started to use analytical approaches to identify predictable patterns in the process of disease emergence. By collating a database of all known prior EID events, identifying their point origins, and correcting for reporting biases, I published the first ever predictive 'hotspots' maps of where future disease emergence is most likely. I have continued this line of research, publishing spatial analyses of the drivers of disease spread, and outlining strategies to predict pandemic emergence. a.

I have 17 years of experience managing zoonotic disease surveillance projects, primarily in Southeast Asia, and leading cutting-edge research on pathogen discovery, disease ecology, and modeling the risk of viral spillover that are strongly complementary to our project's aims. As a PhD student and then NIH-Fogarty Global Health Post-Doc Fellow, I investigated the ecology of Nipah virus in Malaysia and Bangladesh, respectively, using phylogeographic approaches to integrate wildlife host and virus data. Over the last 1 O years, I have served as the global lead for USAI D�PREDICT activities in Thailand and Indonesia managing all human and animal surveillance, and coordinated training and other project activities in Malaysia, Myanmar, Bangladesh, and India. I have managed field-based disease investigations around the world, leading to the following significant discoveries: the wildlife origin of Ebola Reston in the Philippines, first evidence of Ebola Zaire infection in Asian wildlife, MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabian bats, and the first isolation of Nipah virus from the large flying fox in Malaysia. I currently serve as the Modeling & Analytics coordinator under the USAID PREDICT-2 project, leading a team analyzing combined human, animal, and laboratory surveillance data to predict and prevent zoonoses. As part of this effort, I developed a new approach that combines phylogenetic, ecological, and life-history traits to predict viral diversity, host/reservoir range, and spillover potential, leading to a recent first author paper in Nature. 1.

Contribution to Science 1. Characterizing viral diversity in people and wildlife. A large body of my research has focused on the discovery and characterization of viruses in wildlife populations to better anticipate viral emergence. This includes over 10 studies in South and Southeast Asia, generating sequence data for 100s of novel viral strains. These include: molecular evidence for MERS-related coronaviruses circulating in bats at guano mining sites in Thailand; Ebola Reston sequences from multiple bat species in the Philippines captured near pig fanns where outbreaks first occurred; and novel virus discovery using metagenomic approaches in Saudi Arabian bats collected at the site of the first human MERS-CoV case. Lastly, follow-up human viral surveillance in guano miner populations from Thailand yielded a full-genome sequence of HKU-1 coronavirus. Most of these research studies were conducted and published jointly with in-country colleagues on the current proposal. a.

Analyses to better target zoonotic disease surveillance. For the last 5 years, I have led the development of new strategies to better target the geographic regions, transmission pathways, host species, and sample types to make zoonotic surveillance more effective. (b)(4) Previous work includes the first use of species accumulation curves to estimate viral diversity from longitudinal surveillance data in wildlife (Bangladesh bats); two meta-analyses using pathogen-specific transmission and host range data from all known zoonotic EIDs to refine disease surveillance targets; and analysis of data from 100 viral discovery studies in bats to optimize surveillance. a.

I have used my applied ecology background to develop new models that help explain zoonotic spillover and disease circulation. This includes studies of the environmental drivers of bat virus spillover to humans, cross-species transmission among bat species, spatial analysis of emerging zoonotic disease hotspots, and novel phyla-factorization approaches to estimating viral host range. These models explicitly use data from PCR- and serology-based field studies, combined with an understanding of wildlife biology, ecology, and host phylogenetics and evolution, to assess the environmental and demographic drivers of disease transmission -- bridging the gap between field investigations and transmission risk. a.

Personal Statement My research group focuses on the investigation of emerging infectious diseases, especially those caused by zoonotic agents or with unknown etiology. Trained as a biochemist and molecular biologist, I have been working in the field of virology and infectious diseases for more than 25 years and played a key role in identification of animal links with several high-profile zoonotic agents, including Hendra virus in Australia, Nipah virus in Malaysia and SARS virus in China. In my current role as director of the Program in Emerging Infectious Diseases at Duke-NUS Medical School, I have initiated several major projects to develop cutting edge technological platforms for investigation of human infections of unknown etiology using both molecular and serological approaches. We have also started a new area of research into the interplay of immunity, inflammation, apoptosis, DNA damage repair and tumor suppression of bats as part of an ambitious goal to learn from bats on their ability to live long and co-exist with viruses largely free of clinical diseases. Over the years, I have established an extensive collaborative network with scientists all around the world, covering research and surveillance work into infections of human, animal and wildlife in a truly OneHealth approach. I have been invited by international organizations including WHO, FAO, OIE and CEPI for investigation of major disease outbreaks and for playing a consultation role in several committees in the area of zoonotic infections. My research experience and track record fit extremely well with the proposed project. 1.

Contributions to Science 1. Identification of bats as major reservoir of emerging zoonotic viruses. I have used surveillance in wildlife, livestock and humans, coupled with experimental infections under BSL-2, -3, and -4, and laboratory assays to identify evidence that bats are the reservoir for a series of emerging viruses in people, including Hendra virus, Nipah virus, SARS-CoV, and others. This work has been one of the foundations for current interest in bats in EID research globally. Page 58 BiosketchesContact PD/Pl: DASZAK, PETER a.

Establishment of bats as a new mammalian model system to study virus-host interaction and evolutionary biology. Working with collaborators around the world, my lab has amassed an unprecedented collection of serological, tissue and other samples from bat surveillance programs. I have used these to develop and disseminate primary and immortalized bat cell lines, and a host of reagents which my team and collaborators are using to test hypotheses about why bats are able to host so many distinct viruses. Current projects include bat genomics and proteomics; examining the bat MHC, using gene knockout technology to identify links between flight, viral resistance, and longevity. a. Wynne JW, Shiel!

Personal Statement As a Research Assistant Professor in the Emerging Infectious Diseases (EID) program at Duke-NUS Medical School, my research aims to identify host factors important for paramyxovirus and coronavirus replication. I serve as Scientific Director of the Duke-NUS ABSL3 laboratory, which provides infrastructure, expertise and support for research with pathogens requiring high containment. I have a background in virology, with specific training and expertise in high throughput screening. In my current role, my vision for the Duke-NUS ABSL3 is to create a world class containment research lab with an impeccable safety record. A facility that not only Duke-NUS, but Singapore can be proud of, and that enhances the biomedical research activities in Singapore by providing the opportunity for in vitro and in vivo experimentation with BSL3 pathogens. I was involved in the design and accreditation process of commissioning the Duke-NUS ABSL3, so I am intimately familiar with capacities of the facility and the regulatory framework it is embedded in. In addition to my laboratory expertise, I have extensive experience in designing animal experiments with ferrets, non-human primates and bats. As I have trained and worked at BSL3 facilities in Singapore (Duke-NUS Medical School) and the USA (Duke University), and the BSL4 facility in China (Wuhan Institute of Virology), I believe that I have the necessary broad expertise and the international network to continue my research. The current application not only builds logically on my prior work and expertise in this field but is aligned with my future research program. 1.

Ph.D. Completion Date FIELD OF STUDY MM/YYYY 02/1991 Medical Technology 01/1994 Biochemistry 03/2006 Biomedical Sciences I have 20+ years in research and 15+ years of experience in emerging viral zoonoses. I have managed many internationally funded research projects, that involves working with and managing international and local interdisciplinary teams. Majority of my research projects are field surveillance in wild mammals, human behavioral risk surveys, and clinical sampling. I conduct workshops on development of novel diagnostic approaches, appropriate sample collection and handling for different pathogens, and viral characterization in vitro and in vivo. I am the Deputy Chief of Thai Red Cross Emerging Infectious Diseases Health Science Centre which conducts research on emerging zoonoses. My research background is focused on understanding the process of zoonotic disease emergence, particularly viral zoonoses. This includes identifying the bat origin of Nipah virus and MERS-CoV, and pathogenesis and diagnoses of Rabies. My study on the emergence of novel betacoronaviruses found in Thai bats, as well as Nipah virus have been published. Our centre was the first laboratory to correctly diagnose the first human MERS case in Thailand, which led to swift execution of containment measures preventing a MERS outbreak in Thailand. We are now the government's reference laboratory for emerging infectious diseases. I have been the Pl on 5 multidisciplinary research projects that use epidemiology, laboratory, field science and bioinformatics to diagnose and monitor the emergence of wildlife�origin viral zoonoses, including SARS-CoV, Nipah and Hendra virus, Avian influenza and novel viruses from bats. I am also the Thailand country manager for large contracts from USAID involving successful management of teams of virologists, field biologists, veterinarians, epidemiologists, hospitals and laboratorians. 1.

Contributions to Science 1. Surveillance for emerging viruses in Southeast Asia As project coordinator in Malaysia for Eco Health Alliance, and now Director of Conservation Medicine Ltd, I have designed and led field programs that underpin advances in our understanding of wildlife-origin zoonoses (e.g. Macaques and Herpes B), risk factors for emergence (e.g. Nipah virus in fruit bats), the distribution of viruses (e.g. Ebola virus in the Philippines). Through the PREDICT project I currently lead a team that has found 71 novel viruses and 26 known viruses in wildlife reservoirs, livestock and humans. I have helped develop laboratory and personnel capacity for disease surveillance at the Department of Wildlife and National Parks (DWNP), Department of Veterinary Services and Ministry of Health in Malaysia. I have trained over 350 individuals from government partners, local universities and NGOs in surveillance and diagnostics techniques including sharing SOPs and protocols. In collaboration with Sabah Wildlife Department I established the Wildlife Health, Genetic and Forensic Laboratory that has all the equipment necessary to store samples, run extractions, PCR and analysis on biological samples for disease surveillance. The lab is used to screen samples for the PREDICT and to generate PCR and serological data for EcoHealth Alliance. I also establish the new molecular zoonosis laboratories at the DWNP's National Wildlife Forensic Laboratory. The lab is used to screen samples for the PREDICT & DTRA projects and to generate PCR and serological data for EcoHealth Alliance. a.

Personal Statement DEGREE B.S. M.S. Ph.D. COMPLETION DA TE 06/1983 12/1985 05/1989 FIELD OF STUDY Biological Science Molecular Biology Immunology and Med-Micro My laboratory has been collaborating with EcoHealth Alliance and other groups for over 8 years with a major focus on serological assays for the detection of henipaviruses and filoviruses in wildlife, livestock, and human populations. I have been an active researcher in enveloped virus-host cell interactions for the past 30 years. Together with my collaborators, I have made significant contributions to the field. I developed the first oligomeric HIV-1 gp140 glycoprotein subunit vaccine, the vaccinia virus-based reporter gene assay for measuring viral glycoprotein-mediated membrane fusion, defined the fusion tropism of HIV-1 followed by the discovery of the HIV-1 coreceptors (CXCR4 and CCR5). In 1999, I established a collaborative international group of experts in Hendra and Nipah virus research, in areas from structural biochemistry, animal models and in vivo pathogenesis, to the development and testing of vaccines and therapeutics. My work includes the discovery of the Hendra and Nipah virus entry receptors (ephrin-B2/B3), and the development of the feline, ferret and African green monkey models of Hendra and Nipah virus pathogenesis with my collaborators. My lab's henipavirus glycoprotein work, with collaborators, have made the structural solutions and characterization of the F and the G-ephrin receptor glycoprotein interactions, and the discovery and development of antiviral human monoclonal antibodies to ABL V and Hendra and Nipah viruses; one (m102.4) having a Phase I clinical trial completed in 2016, and has been used by emergency protocol in 13 people in Australia and one in the US because of significant risk of infection. I developed the Hendra/Nipah subunit vaccine based on soluble Hendra G glycoprotein (HeV-sG); called Equivac® HeV (Zoetis, Inc.) the first commercialized vaccine to a BSL-4 agent, and being developed as a human use Nipha/Hendra vaccine supported by CEPI. Relevant to the present proposal, we have developed the first reverse genetics system for the henipavirus, Cedar virus, which will serve as a platform to assay henipavirus neutralization; and we have developed a panel 17+ different soluble envelope glycoproteins from all the known filoviruses and henipaviruses for serological surveillance studies, and have the tools to conduct the studies, and carry out capacity building and training programs. 1.

Contributions to Science 1. My Ph.D. thesis studies centered on the discovery and characterization of a specific receptor for human plasm in on Group A Streptococci during a rotation project as a 1st year student. My studies revealed that certain group A streptococci elaborated surface receptors that could bind selectively a key fibrinolytic enzyme, plasmin, while having no binding ability towards the zymogen precursor plasminogen or Page 73 BiosketchesContact PD/Pl: DASZAK, PETER other serine proteases. The bacterium-bound plasmin remained enzymatically active including its ability to hydrolyze a fibrin clot. Bound plasmin could not be inhibited by its physiological regulator, alpha 2-plasmin inhibitor. Since these organisms produced streptokinase, a protein that complexes with plasminogen producing an active enzyme that can convert plasminogen to plasmin, they could accelerate the destruction of the extracellular matrix environment: findings that formed a molecular-pathogenic model for the "flesh-eating streptococci". a.

My independent postdoctoral fellowship focused on the early stages of HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein mediated membrane fusion as a surrogate model of HIV-1 entry. I established a vaccinia virus-based reporter gene assay for measuring viral (HIV-1) glycoprotein-mediated membrane fusion and generated the first panel of T-cell tropic and Macrophage-tropic HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) encoding recombinant vaccinia virus vectors and I used these tools to be the first to hypothesize that the cellular tropism of HIV-1 could be explained by specific membrane fusion factors required for the different classes of HIV-1 Envs. I also developed the first soluble and secreted full-length oligomeric HIV-1 gp140 glycoprotein and explored the importance of its native oligomeric structure in terms of its presentation of conformational and virus-neutralizing epitopes through the development and characterization of more than 100 murine monoclonal antibodies. a.

My early studies on the cellular and viral membrane fusion tropism of HIV-1 and the development of a sensitive and specific reporter gene assay of cell-cell membrane fusion facilitated the discovery of the first membrane fusion accessory factor (fusin, now known as CXCR4) that we earlier hypothesized existed, and this rapidly led to the discovery by us and others of the second factor for macrophage-tropic Envs (CCR5); the HIV-1 coreceptors. These findings were a significant breakthrough in HIV research leading to numerous new directions in understanding HIV-1 pathogenesis as well as new therapeutic strategies. a.

My initial work on HIV-1 entry led to further independent studies which focused on follow-up investigations characterizing the roles of the HIV-1 coreceptors in the virus entry process. These studies revealed the interplay between the HIV-1 entry receptors, mapped important domains of the coreceptors involved in HIV-1 Env interaction, and also revealed possible avenues of how an HIV-1 Env might engage and differently utilize the CXCR4 and CCR5 coreceptors for infection. In addition, I also engaged in collaborative follow-up studies exploring the utility of soluble oligomeric HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins as subunit vaccine immunogens (gp140) which I initiated at NIH while a postdoctoral fellow, with the unusual R2 HIV-1 Env isolate and led to the first NIAID program project grant funded at USU. a.

My most recent research has been on emerging viruses that impact human and domestic livestock populations; including Australian bat lyssavirus (rabies-like virus), filoviruses (Ebola and Marburg) and the henipaviruses (Hendra and Nipah). My lab was the first to publish on Hendra virus outside of Australia. I obtained the first NIAID funded project providing monetary support on select agent research to an overseas laboratory (2003). Henipavirus research has been the major focus of my lab for the past 20 years, covering areas from structural biochemistry, in vivo pathogenesis and animal model development to the development and testing of vaccines and therapeutics. My lab developed the first peptide henipavirus fusion inhibitors, subunit vaccine and neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies (mAb ), and supported the development of the feline and ferret models of Hendra and Nipah infection and pathogenesis in Australia and the development of the first nonhuman primate model (USAMRIID). We and our collaborators tested the in vivo efficacy of the Hendra/Nipah vaccine (HeV-sG) and an anti-HeV/NiV G-specific neutralizing human mAb. One human mAb (m102.4) has been used by compassionate emergency protocol in 13 people in Australia and one individual in the United States; a Phase I clinical trial was completed in May, 2016. The henipavirus subunit vaccine, HeV-sG, was launched; called Equivac® HeV (Zoetis, Inc.) and is the first commercialized and deployed vaccine to a BSL-4 agent. Additional findings include the discovery of the henipavirus entry receptors (ephrin-B2/B3) and produced soluble versions of the G and F proteins facilitating their structural solutions. a.

(hons) Ph.D. Completion Date FIELD OF STUDY MM/YYYY 05/2008 Biology 10/2016 Emerging Infectious Diseases Bats are increasingly identified as animal reservoirs of medically-relevant emerging RNA viruses (e.g. Nipah virus, Ebola virus and SARS-coronavirus). However, the environmental, behavioral and host dynamics that contribute to spill over into human populations remains largely unknown; this is especially true for ebolaviruses. In the past year, two novel filoviruses with unknown pathogenicity have been discovered: Bombali virus and Mengla virus. We anticipate that a diversity of related-filoviruses exists undetected in bat reservoir hosts, and identifying these unknown viruses and understanding known filovirus-host interactions will improve our knowledge of bat species that are hosts for ebolaviruses. Collectively, these results will be used to understand transmission dynamics in wildlife hosts and generate risk-models for Ebola virus disease outbreaks. I have had a collaborative research relationship with the EcoHealth Alliance (EHA) for 5+ years, and this Emerging Infectious Diseases Research Centers Coordination Center (EIDRC CC) for the Emerging Infectious Diseases Research Centers (EIDRC) proposal will allow for an important extension of our collaboration and mutual research interests on emerging viruses, infectious disease surveillance and building threat reduction networks. Additionally, I have expertise in virology, biosurveillance and capacity training in international settings to successfully contribute to the aims of this proposal. In collaboration with EHA, we have developed a multiplex serologically immunoassay that can detect antibodies specific to or cross-reactive with all presently described filoviruses. This immunoassay tool will be key for detecting the serological footprint of known and unknown filoviruses in bat hosts. This assay is presently being used for biosurveillance by collaborators in Southeast Asia and South Asia. Assay validation is being undertaken between our laboratory (USU) and collaborators at the Dr. Vincent Munster's group at the NIH Rocky Mountain Laboratory and United States Army Medical Institute of Infectious Diseases. 1.

Hemming Fellowship, Henry M. Jackson Foundation C. Contributions to Science 1. Virus-host interactions. My Ph.D. thesis research was focused on virus-host interactions: understanding bats as hosts of zoonotic viruses and Australian bat lyssavirus (ABLV) cellular entry. This work entailed exploring the antiviral mechanisms that enable cellular persistence of viruses in bats, particularly, authophagy. Findings revealed that the autophagy pathway is induced upon infection with Australian bat lyssavirus (ABLV), a Rabies-virus related virus carried by Australian Pteropus bats. The combined pharmacological and genetic studies of the autophagy pathway in the context of this virus-host interaction indicated that autophagy functions as an antiviral defense. The study also demonstrated that bat-derived cell lines have elevated levels of basal autophagy, which might help to explain the cellular mechanism that contribute to the ability of bats to act as host to these viruses. An additional finding from these studies was that activation of autophagy may have therapeutic benefits during neurotropic virus infection. Page 78 BiosketchesContact PD/Pl: DASZAK, PETER a.

Contributions to Science 1. I rediscovered Shiga toxin during my fellowship, while participating in a training program at the Institute of Nutrition for Central America and Panama in 1969. A significant part of my research career has focused on Shiga toxin and its role in pathogenesis. The major recognized virulence factor of Shigella was its ability to invade gut epithelial cells; the previously described Shiga 'neurotoxin' was long forgotten until I showed that a protein produced by Shigella dysenteriae type 1 (Sd) caused inflammatory mucosal damage of the bowel and bloody inflammatory exudates similar to dysentery in a rabbit model. I later proved the two toxin activities were due to the same protein. My work resulted in purification of Shiga toxin (Stx), sequenced the binding subunit, identified its mammalian cell receptor, described its translocation to the cell cytoplasm via receptor mediated endocytosis, and identified its effects on vascular endothelium. This work paved the way to understand the pathogenesis of E. coli 0157 and other serotypes associated with hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS). My lab developed monoclonal antibodies essential for a rapid commercial diagnostic test for all Stx producing bacteria. I was principal investigator in all of these studies. a.

In the 1980's I began work on the molecular pathogenesis of giardiasis and cryptosporidiosis. We first developed a method to grow Giardia trophozoites in bulk using roller bottle culture, and used these parasites to Identify a trypsin-activated mannose-6-P lectin mediating binding to mammalian cell surfaces. These properties were consistent with activation in upper small bowel precisely where Giardia colonizes. We also discovered a Cryptosporidium parvum lectin which mediated binding to mammalian cells, and showed it is a member of a family of mucin-like glycoproteins containing a-N-acetylgalactosamine. Together these pioneering studies documented the role and relevance of carbohydrate binding ligands in the pathogenesis of intestinal protozoa I infections. I was primary or co-investigator in all of these studies. a. Lev B, Ward H, Keusch GT, Pereira MEA (1986). Lectin activation in Giardia lamblia by host protease: A novel host parasite interaction.

I developed a rat model of protein energy malnutrition and demonstrated macrophage functional abnormalities, including chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and intracellular bactericidal activity. Together with colleagues in Guatemala we documented multiple host defense defects in malnourished children including impaired neutrophil function, decreased serum opsonic activity, complement deficiency, and T-cell deficits, and their reversal with nutritional interventions. Subsequent studies in Zaire (now DRC) in AIDS patients on the pathogenesis of wasting syndrome revealed markedly elevated pro-inflammatory cytokine levels that could drive metabolic shifts underlying cachexia. HIV�infected but clinically stable non-wasted subjects also had high pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, however this was countered by elevated levels of the antagonist cytokines IL-1 RA and TN Fa-soluble receptor p55 at a molar ratio known to block inflammatory effects of IL-1 ~ and TN Fa in vitro. This was the first biologically plausible mechanism to explain the preservation of weight and body composition in long term clinical non�progressors. a.

I have promoted the inclusion of low and middle income countries in the setting of priorities and governance for research, and called for a new investment and partnerships for a global health system. I initiated research and training in diverse topics such as ethics, stigma, macroeconomics and health, and environment and health and economic development.

We sought to understand how lgM was responsible for these activities, and to understand the consequences for the immune system. We demonstrated that lgM immune complexes became concentrated onto marginal zone B cells, which then transported these complexes to follicular dendritic cells for deposition. This suggested an unappreciated innate role for this subset of B lymphocytes in the early steps of initiation of primary immune responses. A role for orchestrated transport of antigen and immune complexes in secondary lymphoid organs is now widely accepted as early events in immune responses. a. Ferguson AR, Corley RB (2005).

Data from our laboratory and others had indicated that lgM antibodies were not always secreted as pentameric molecules with J chain, but little evidence existed to indicate if these antibodies shared functions with pentameric lgM, or if they had unique functions. We demonstrated that two alternative forms of lgM, lgM hexamers and lgM monomers, had discrete activities. Hexamers active complement far more efficiently than pentamers and could be deleterious in certain autoimmune diseases, while monomers did not fix complement, lacked the ability to function in antigen trapping, and could also accelerate disease manifestations in autoimmune prone mice. These data supported the important role for strict quality control standards in the assembly and secretion of lgM antibodies for maintenance of proper homeostasis in the immune system. a.

Prior to these studies there was controversy in the field as to how J chain was added to assembling lgM, and whether the addition of J chain was responsible for catalyzing assembly of lgM into polymers. Where assembly occurred was also controversial. We demonstrated, however, that lgM assembly is regulated in the endoplasmic reticulum by a process involving thiol regulation. Further, J chain plays no role in mediated lgM assembly, and its addition is a terminally late step in the production of polymeric lgM. To complete these studies, we made use of various biochemical assays including pulse chase experiments. We also cloned and expressed J chain to demonstrate its role in modulating polymer assembly, and this work remains the definitive description of lgM assembly. a. Reddy PS, Corley RB (1999).

Defining mouse mammary tumor virus as an endogenous superantigen, and demonstrating the role of B lymphocytes in the MMTV life cycle. Prior to these studies there was evidence for the existence of that endogenous superantigens which played important roles in shaping the T cell repertoire in mice, but the identity and nature of these superantigens were unknown. During a differential subtraction cloning process, we identified a mouse mammary tumor virus, Mtv-9, as a differentially expressed gene during activation of B cells, and later linked this to superantigens and suggested a role for B cells in the MMTV life cycle. a.

Personal Statement The identification of highly pathogenic human coronaviruses (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV) underscored the importance of understanding how viruses emerge from zoonotic reservoirs and how these emergent viruses replicate and cause pathogenesis in the new host. My research has focused on several key aspects of these questions by working to understand the cellular tropism of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in primary human lung cells, how host genetic pathways and gene networks affect virus replication and pathogenesis and how manipulating the coronavirus genome changes the host innate immune response to virus infection. I have more than 15 years' experience working with highly pathogenic human coronaviruses primarily as part of large multi-institutional projects that require constant lines of communication and data sharing to be successful. I have worked closely with Dr. Barie to lead and manage at least 4 large multi-institutional projects/awards and am familiar with all of the day to day and long term requirements for a successful collaboration. This project will extend an existing collaboration with Dr. Daszak and team at EcoHealth and world-wide and the required lines of communication have already been established to make this application a success. Relevant publications: My most relevant work to date focuses on using primary human lung cells as culture models for human coronavirus strains, which can be used to characterize the virus strains we propose to study in the current proposal. 1.

Finding suitable in vitro models for studying newly identified or emerged human respiratory viruses can be a challenge. Primary cells isolated from the human conducting airway can be cultured at an air liquid interface and following maturation recapitulate the morphology of the airway epithelium. These cultures provide a unique in vitro model and for one human coronavirus, HKU 1, provide the only in vitro model for studying this virus. a.

Contributions to Science 1. Understanding the origin and cross-species transmission of bat coronaviruses. Bats harbor a large diversity of coronaviruses (CoVs) and have been identified as the natural reservoirs and evolutionary sources of several emerging human coronaviruses, including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS�CoV) that emerged in China in 2002, However, CoV evolution and diversification in their bat hosts remain poorly understood. In this study, I used a Bayesian statistical framework to study the macroevolution of bat CoVs and their cross-species transmission dynamics and dispersal in China. This work reveals that alpha�CoVs were able to switch hosts more frequently and between more distantly related taxa than beta-CoVs during their evolution and suggest that phylogenetic distance among hosts represents higher constraint on host switches for beta- than alpha-CoVs. We identify the host taxa and geographic regions that together define hotspots of CoV phyla-diversity in China, allowing for more targeted surveillance of bat-borne CoVs and early detection to mitigate disease emergence and outbreaks in the future. a.

I have 17 years of experience conducting field-based research on the ecology and health of wildlife, with a focus on bats and rodents, and 3 years of international experience in bat disease surveillance in often resource-limited and remote sites. Moreover, I integrate principles of ecophysiology and disease ecology to identify specific environmental and ecological drivers that enhance pathogen persistence and transmission between bat hosts and to proactively prevent spillover events and safeguard human and animal health. My research has led to a better understanding of the consequences of environmental manipulation on bat health and disease dynamics at the human-wildlife interface, and development of a cave prioritization index to promote bat conservation. 1.

Contributions to Science 1. Wildlife ecology & conservation. Human-bat interfaces, such as bat-occupied caves visited for tourism or guano harvesting or bushmeat markets, must be considered when monitoring public health while promoting wildlife conservation, and demands a multidisciplinary approach. Bats and rodents are the two largest Page 98 BiosketchesContact PD/Pl: DASZAK, PETER mammalian orders, yet many populations are declining globally. Working with collaborators in the Philippines, I identified anthropogenic and environmental drivers of assemblage composition, population abundance, and individual health in cave-roosting bats of the Philippines. This research led to the identification of environmental and human disturbance factors that are most influential in structuring bat assemblages, thus allowing for prioritization of caves to conserve cave bats. Moreover, my findings highlight that human disturbance at roosting and foraging sites contributes to reduced diversity and simplified composition in cave bat assemblages. Minimizing disease risks to public health requires integrating tools from applied ecology and analytical modelling to identify ecological drivers that promote virus persistence and spread in bat assemblages. We found that transmission rates of viruses between bat species is strongly associated with roosting ecology, with species that roost in caves having the highest rate of virus sharing with co-roosting species. Caves often house a diversity of bat species, some of which form large aggregations, so assemblage composition and population structure likely contributes to infection dynamics in cave-roosting bats. a.

Bat health & disease surveillance. Bats are reservoir hosts for numerous zoonotic diseases, including fatal diseases such as rabies, Hendra, and Marburg. Despite the potentially devastating consequences of zoonotic disease spillover on public health, few studies have examined the ecological mechanisms that promote zoonotic disease persistence in diverse bat assemblages. To understand the underlying individual-level mechanisms that drive compositional turnover and species loss in bat communities, I assessed physiological health of 725 individual bats (i.e., neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratios, leukocyte counts, body condition, and ectoparasite counts) exposed to gradients of cave disturbance. I also included measures of cave quality (i.e., size and complexity), social context (i.e., species richness, conspecific and heterospecific abundance), and intrinsic traits (i.e., sex, reproductive state) to understand how context�specific factors may modulate individual health when exposed to disturbance. My findings reveal the importance of assemblage and population dynamics and ecological traits (e.g., sex, reproductive state) on the health of cave-roosting bats, which may influence an individual's susceptibility to infection. Working with regional collaborators from Turkey, Armenia, Georgia, Pakistan, and Jordan, I am characterizing the diversity and composition of bat species and associated coronaviruses across Western Asia in conjunction profiling bat-human interfaces at sampled sites to assess the risk of zoonotic disease emergence in the region. a.

Network coordination & capacity building. Zoonotic threats to public health are typically shared across a region due to shared host species distributions, consequently our ability to take proactive actions against such threats requires coordinated initiatives to build the capacity of multidisciplinary partners to study host ecology and disease surveillance across the region. I serve on the steering committee of the NSF-funded Southeast Asian Bat Research Unit (2011 - present), and work collaboratively with a large multidisciplinary network of 30+ international bat researchers to promote capacity building and research activities of local bat biologists in Southeast Asian countries. Specifically, I conduct workshops on how to design and implement research studies in bat ecology, including publishing results in peer-reviewed journals. I provide hands-on training on proper techniques for capturing, handling, and identifying bat species; collecting morphological measurements and ecological and acoustic data; taking diagnostic samples to assess measures of stress physiology; surveying and mapping cave systems, and site characterization to assess human disturbance levels and types of bat-human interactions) in Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, Philippines, and Thailand. Furthermore, I serve as the Field Scientist for the DTRA-funded Western Asia Bat Research Network (WAB-Net, 2018 - present) with the primary responsibility to establish and build capacity in zoonotic disease field surveillance with local multidisciplinary partners across Western Asia. Working with 10+ WAB-Net partners, I developed standardized field protocols for collecting non-lethal samples from bats and characterization of study sites to identify potential routes of interactions between bats and humans and/or domestic animals as well as developed standardized laboratory protocols for detecting and characterizing coronavirus diversity. I coordinate (e.g., procure research permits, necessary supplies and equipment, export and import permits, etc.) and oversee all sampling events across the region to ensure standardization of data collection and sample testing as well as biosafety (PPE) guidelines. a.

I am a lead author on a study that analyzes paired human survey and serological data to characterize associations between human-animal interaction and zoonotic spillover risk in Southern China (recently submitted for publication). The study provides the first serological evidence of bat-born SARS-related coronavirus and HKU10 coronavirus spillover and shows that domestic animals, in addition to wildlife, are an important link in understanding transmission from bat to human populations. As the lead data analyst on the study, I oversaw the statistical design, execution, and reporting. In addition to this study, I am a lead on analysis and reporting of human survey data collected in over 20 countries under the PREDICT project. In this role, I have developed an automatic report generator that provides data summaries, maps and graphics, and results of statistical analyses to global partners. This tool allows researchers and policy makers to understand and interpret links between animal contact and self-reported illness drawn from a complex data set. 2. Toxicological and exposure modeling in environmental risk assessment. I have formal training in human health and ecological risk assessment and three years of experience consulting in risk assessment under state environmental departments, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). In this time, I worked to advance risk assessment techniques to make better use of available toxicological and exposure data through statistical modeling. I frequently presented on the topic and contributed to novel risk assessments that incorporated mechanic, probabilistic and Bayesian modeling techniques to improve risk characterization and communication. a.

My research on Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in Egypt and Jordan for the USAID PREDICT-2 project and for the CDC Global Disease Detection Program have provided me with more than six years of experience in Egypt and Jordan working with communities along the camel value chain to identify MERS-CoV spillover from dromedary camels and behavioral risks for human MERS infection. Additionally, I have worked with an infectious disease surveillance system operating in 8 countries in the Middle East and North Africa region for influenza and other respiratory viruses to characterize seasonal transmission patterns and to monitor activity against alert thresholds in real time. I have also investigated tuberculosis transmission among New York City public housing residents using molecular, geospatial, and sociodemographic techniques. As the PREDICT-2 country liaison for Egypt and Jordan, I have cultivated critical management abilities that will prove beneficial in the proposed research project, including time management, budgeting, research planning, liaising with community leaders, cross-cultural communication, stakeholder engagement, and results communication. 1.

Contributions to Science 1. Using molecular and geospatial data to conduct epidemiological investigations. My early research as an epidemiologist focused on the transmission of tuberculosis (TB) among New York City (NYC) public housing residents. TB incidence in NYC had reached a peak in the 1990s and has significantly declined due to advances in case detection and treatment protocols. By the early 201 Os, a majority of TB cases in NYC were among foreign-born individuals who became infected in TB-endemic countries before arriving to the United States. However, in early 2011, a number of TB cases among U.S.-born NYC public housing residents raised concern that TB may be spreading within public housing facilities or directly between public housing residents. If true, this TB transmission occurring within NYC posed an opportunity for public health intervention aimed at interrupting further TB transmission. Working with the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene Bureau of Tuberculosis Control, I reviewed all confirmed TB cases in NYC between 2001 and 2009, and geocoded all patient addresses to obtain their residence's building identification numbers (BINs) and ran them against the New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) registered BINs to classify cases as public housing residents (NYCHA) or non-public housing residents. Overall, I found U.S.-born NYCHA residents had twice the TB incidence of all other U.S.-bom NYC residents. However, comparing the molecular TB strain data among NYCHA residents, I found they had high strain diversity. Further, there was no molecular evidence of TB strain clustering within NYCHA buildings, NYCHA complexes, or between NYCHA residents. Therefore, I concluded the increased burden of TB among NY CHA residents is due to public housing's role as a social safety net (which concentrates a population having many independent TB risk factors: history of homelessness, poverty, etc.) rather than due to spread within buildings or between residents. Due to these findings, the Bureau partnered with NY CHA to raise awareness of TB among residents and to provide information on getting free testing and treatment. a.

While working for the CDC Global Disease Detection Regional Center in Cairo, Egypt, I served as team lead for the Eastern Mediterranean Acute Respiratory Infection Surveillance (EMARIS) Network which operated in Egypt, Iraq, Iraq-Kurdistan, Jordan, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, and Yemen. The prevailing thought on influenza seasonality was that many countries or regions with arid/desert-like or tropical climates do not experience pronounced seasonal activity as do other countries with temperate climates (which experience Northern Hemisphere or Southern Hemisphere seasonal patterns). Understanding seasonal influenza patterns is an important public health priority because it may impact seasonal influenza vaccination policy and timing the allocation of hospital and clinic resources. I analyzed influenza patterns across seven years of patient data from the EMARIS Network in Egypt and Jordan, and found that both countries clearly exhibit Northern Hemisphere influenza seasonal patterns, with increased activity between November and May typically reaching peak activity between January and March. We communicated this information to our hospital partners in the EMARIS Network and with the Ministries of Health in order to support redistribution of relevant hospital and clinic resources during times of peak influenza activity as well as to add on to the evidence base supporting the adoption of Northern Hemisphere seasonal influenza vaccination in both countries. a.

In addition to the contributions described above, I have been working with the PREDICT-2 team to describe viral spillover, including MERS, in Egypt and Jordan and to characterize behavioral risks for MERS. We conduct triangulated viral surveillance among people, wildlife, and livestock along animal-human interfaces in both countries to detect known and novel viruses from the viral families of Coronaviruses, Influenza viruses, Filoviruses, and Paramyxoviruses as well as to detect antibodies to MERS-CoV. All enrolled participants are asked to have nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs and sera collected and to complete a standardized questionnaire assessing social and demographic characteristics and behavioral practices. In Jordan, I developed additional questionnaire modules specifically addressing exposures and behavioral practices pertaining to dromedary camels which are being used to characterize specific risk behaviors for MERS spillover from camels to humans. Analyses are currently underway and will be completed in the first half of 2019. a.

Qualitative analyses of global datasets attuned to socially-sensitive topics. Nuanced attitudes and beliefs are difficult to surface through quantitative human research tools alone, and qualitative explorations are a boon for researchers investigating populations living in environments with rigid social traditions. Through my qualitative work with Columbia University's RAISE Initiative, I collaboratively leveraged the focus group dataset to understand the complex ways in which focus groups initially expressed locally conforming beliefs about highly sensitive reproductive health issues, before offering more nuanced beliefs and attitudes related to gender, age, and circumstance. My other work, including those currently in progress at EcoHealth Alliance, has benefitted from this approach in framing the observations not only against the social environment, but against the progression of ideas within a given transcript. a.

Contribution to Science 1. Research on the origins of emerging viruses. Numerous high impact emerging viruses appear to have bat reservoirs (e.g. SARS-CoV, EBOV, NiV, HeV, MERS-CoV, SADS-CoV). As research assistant and program coordinator on four prior R01 s, my work has helped demonstrate their bat origin (SARS-CoV, SADS-CoV), analyze the drivers of their emergence and risk factors for spillover. Collaborating with virologists in China, I have identified SARS-like CoVs and other viruses in bats and other mammals. This work provides critical reagents and resources that have helped advance understanding of virus-host binding and may contribute to vaccine development.

Understanding the risk factors of zoonotic disease mergence among the high-risk communities. With its rapid urbanization and development as well as the high diversity of animal species, southern China is facing major social and ecological changes that result in human and animal interactions favoring the emergence of zoonotic diseases. In order to identify the zoonotic risks and develop a risk-mitigation strategy, the study used a biological-behavioral surveillance method to demonstrate the serological evidence of viral spill-over into human population, and identify demographic factors and human-animal interactions associated with viral exposure and self-reported severe acute respiratory and influenza-like illness symptoms. Combining existing protective factors and intervention opportunities, individual, social, community, and policy-level mitigation strategies are recommended to prevent zoonotic risk in Southern China. a.

Contributions to Science 1. Publications. Since 2011, I have co-authored >80 publications with >2000 citations. These publications have made a major contribution to the knowledge of the epidemiology, clinical features and treatment of P. knowlesi malaria. My studies on artesunate in severe knowlesi and vivax malaria (William et al, Emerg Infect Dis 2011, Barber et al, Clin Inf Dis 2013) have changed global (WHO) and SE Asian policy and practice. With collaborators Anstey, Barber and Grigg, my RCTs of artemisinin combination therapy (ACT) for non-falciparum species have led to national policy change to universal ACT for uncomplicated vivax and knowlesi malaria. In Sabah, I lead a large ongoing program of research into the prevention, surveillance and management of malaria and other tropical infections with national and international collaborators. In 2017 I was a joint recipient of Malaysia's prestigious Merdeka Award in Health, Science and Technology, for outstanding contribution to the treatment of knowlesi malaria.

Personal Statement I have nearly 20 years of laboratory experience on human viruses. I have started off with the sentinel surveillance of Hand, foot and mouth Disease (HFMD) from 2000-2004 providing molecular screening on swabs obtained from public hospitals and sentinel clinics. Results were made available to the Department of Public Health and State's Disaster Management Committee for outbreak management. I was tasked to develop a serological assay for the detection of Enterovirus 71. I have received the prestigious National Science Fellowship (NSF) Award from the Ministry of Science, Technology and Environment for my work on EV71 in Sarawak. I was also involved with the screening of suspected SARS-CoV specimens from Sarawak General Hospital (SGH) using molecular techniques but fortunately none were confirmed positive during that time. No manuscript was published on the work on SARS-CoV due to negative results but the experience of donning and doffing extra amount of PPE, setting up administrative and the maximizing the use of engineering controls to work safety in the laboratory become an invaluable experience for a virologist such as myself. Thereafter, I pursued my doctorate degree in Newcastle University, UK under the supervision of Emeritus Professor Geoffrey Toms. My project was to study the protective nature of maternal antibodies against human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). I have to work closely with the research nurse to obtain in nasoparyngeal swabs and blood serum from hRSV infected infants. All work related with my MSc and PhD were tissue culture, molecular biology and serology intensive. Whilst heading the Centre for Tropical and Emerging Diseases, I have worked closely with zoologists from my UNI MAS to study the seroprevalence of hantavirus in both rodents captured from residential and forested areas of Sarawak. The work involved setting up traps in strategic locations, capturing the animal, obtaining specimens and ethically euthanizing the animal. I have collaborated with Southampton University, UK funded by Newton Fund to study the nasal carriage of Streptococcus pneumoniae in the Malaysian population in hope to provide disease burden data to influence the adoption of the pneumococcal vaccine in Malaysia. The newest project is Page 133 BiosketchesContact PD/Pl: DASZAK, PETER in Human Papillomavirus (HPV) and cervical cancer. We are trying to define the molecular epidemiology of HPV in Sarawak and at the same time provide HPV DNA test for the rural communities. The work involves explaining the study to the women, obtaining informed consent and obtaining the specimen. Participating women are also visually screened for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) using visual inspection using acetic acid (VIA). This work is still at its infancy and 2 manuscripts are already in the pipeline. Recently, we have acquired the careHPV system (Qiagen), packed it in boxes and took a flight to Bario, a remote town at the northeast of Sarawak and set the portable laboratory there to screen the women for HPV infection and also providing them with cervical examination. 1.

Ph.D. Completion Date FIELD OF STUDY MM/YYYY 05/2004 Biotechnology 05/2008 Zoology 05/2013 Zoology I am interested in the systematics and molecular evolution of Southeast Asian mammals, particularly bats. I aim to understand the diversity of several genera in these groups, looking for common patterns in their distributions and origins. This allows me to understand the extent to which biogeography of Southeast Asia has shaped the genetic diversity of mammals in this region. Currently, my lab is examining the evolution of Roundleaf bats, Horseshoe bats, and several groups of rodents. We are studying multiple transmission lines (paternal, maternal and autosomal markers) along with behavioral characteristic such as echolocation, and we are using geometric morphometric technique to identify taxonomic units. My hope is that this research will provide a better understanding of the mode of evolution and diversification for bats and rodents in Southeast Asia. I am also keen to move forward with the advancement of the genomic field, by incorporating bioinformatics to better utilize natural history collections. I hope to use this new tool to better understand the microbial fauna carried by mammalian hosts. 1.

Different climatic conditions and geologic settings have been seen as the major signature in promoting diversification in mammals. Different types of molecular techniques allow us to capture this variation and understand when all of this happens. Further, new analyses allow us to test for the potential pitfall in analyzing data from different group of mammals. The following manuscripts are the flagship manuscripts for the last 5 years. a.

Assessing bat diversity across Malaysia. The actual bat diversity in Malaysia may be underestimated, as there are several new species recently described which were unknown due to their cryptic morphology. New species are the result of incorporating: molecular methods with greater resolution, electronically recorded acoustic calls, and efficient field techniques such as harp traps, to properly describe species diversity and status. Different hypotheses have been proposed to facilitate speciation processes in Southeast Asian bats (e.g. geographic isolation, habitat fragmentation, adaptation to different echolocation calls, etc.). a.

Rabies is the most fatal among all the infectious diseases with 100% mortality rate, however 100% protective if vaccine is used properly Therefore proper epidemiology, strains detection in different animals and variants detection is of utmost importance. Although rabies death toll is highest in Asian countries however studies are scarce from this region. My group studied the molecular epidemiology in Thailand, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Laos and Sri Lanka. We found a wide range of genotypes of rabies viruses are circulating in not only dogs but among cats and a wide range of wild animals. Rabies in bat is well recognized in the Americas however we first time confirmed rabies in an Asian bat. We also detected rabies for the first time in civet. We also showed that the strain is a variant of circulating rabies virus indicating genetic changes are occurring which may jeopardize vaccination. a.

Detection of animal-human reassortant of rotaviruses in human infections. Rotavirus gastroenteritis was designated as the first emerging infectious disease. Although there is species specificity regarding the genotype distribution of rotavirus, however, in several instances strains can jump from animals to humans or can form human-animal reassortant virus. These strains are challenge for the current rotavirus vaccination strategy. We have documented several events of human-animal reassortants during our research in several Asian countries. a.

Diagnosis of diseases is hampered by unavailability of user friendly, economical, rapid and robust diagnostic kits in the remote areas of Asia and Africa where the zoonotic diseases are more. Every year about 55,000 people die of rabies however it is known that many cases go undiagnosed because of the lack of diagnostic facilities in many areas. My group developed immunochromatography kit for diagnosis of rabies which is easy to use, robust and with high sensitivity and specificity. In many developing countries host response after vaccination cannot be evaluated due to the Page 143 BiosketchesContact PD/Pl: DASZAK, PETER unavailability of cell culture facilities. We also developed an immunochromatography based kit to detect the level of neutralizing antibody after rabies vaccination to determine whether the immune response is protective. a.

Personal Statement: I am an infectious diseases clinician-scientist based in Singapore and my research is focused on diagnosis, epidemiology, pathogenesis and clinical management of tropical and emerging infectious diseases. My research has been conducted in the field in low and middle income countries in South East Asia including Indonesia, Myanmar, Malaysian Borneo and Bangladesh as well as in Tanzania, Africa. In Indonesia, Bangladesh and Tanzania, my research has been conducted on clinical management and vascular pathogenesis of malaria including drug-resistant parasites in district hospitals and outpatient clinics. These studies were done in collaboration with the Indonesian Ministry of Health, Oxford University and Duke University. In Myanmar, the research has been conducted with the National Tuberculosis Reference Laboratory on the molecular epidemiology, transmission, diagnosis, and clinical therapeutics of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis in Yangon. In Malaysian Borneo, I have collaborated with the Malaysian Ministry of Health and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine on a novel emerging zoonotic malaria, Plasmodium knowlesi, which is increasing in incidence and is now the most common cause of malaria in Malaysia due to changes in land use. These studies have included multi-disciplinary studies involving entomologists, social scientists, geospatial experts, parasitologists and economists. Results from several of these studies have been used in the development of World Health Organization guidelines for malaria. In Malaysian Borneo, I have also collaborated on multiple clinical studies on central nervous system infections (including encephalitis) in both adults and children, as well as studies to delineate the etiologies of acute undifferentiated febrile illness in adults. In Singapore, I am currently a clinician scientist, practicing adult infectious disease physician and designated lead researcher for emerging viral and infectious disease at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases, the designated facility for management of outbreaks. I have been involved in the national response and research related to the Zika outbreak in Singapore in 2016 and well as the travel related case of Monkeypox in 2019. I currently also have ongoing research projects looking at the pathogenesis and clinical management of dengue in Singapore and Malaysia. I am also the deputy director of the research training office of the National Centre for Infectious Diseases, whose role is to co-ordinate pandemic research in Singapore.

Contributions to Science 1. Research on the epidemiology, risk factors, clinical management of the emerging zoonotic malaria, Plasmodium knowlesi. In collaboration with Malaysian investigators, we have detailed the increasing incidence of human knowlesi malaria in Malaysian Borneo with currently over 3000 cases annually, despite the near elimination of the human malarias such as P. falciparum and P. vivax. Collaborating with investigators, I have also been detailing the rise of this parasite in other areas of South East Asia including Sumatra, Indonesia. In an inter-disciplinary study with other scientists, we have also detailed that change in land use and local ecology leading to a change in simian and vector behavior is a main driver of the increasing incidence. Clinical studies including randomized controlled trials have also led to rigorous data for evidence based clinical management of complicated and uncomplicated knowlesi malaria. The results from these studies have also been used in World Health Organization guidelines on the management of malaria. a.

I have done clinical and translational research to further characterize the role of the host vascular endothelium on the pathogenesis of severe disease in falciparum, vivax and knowlesi malaria. This has led to several novel findings which have led to translational studies of adjunctive agents to attenuate vascular damage and dysfunction in critical infections such as malaria and dengue. These findings have recently also been shown by other investigators to be relevant in other viral hemorrhagic pathogens such as Ebola. a.

Personal Statement The HIV/STD Research Program (HSRP) is a joint enterprise of the US CDC and Thailand Ministry of Public Health. HSRP investigates clinical and behavioral interventions to reduce HIV and STI transmission among men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women (TGW) at high risk of acquisition. HSRP's Laboratory section provides both clinical laboratory and microbiology capacity for clinical trials/investigations as well as original investigations focused on HIV/STI prevention. I started my current role in Bangkok, Thailand in May 2016, where I oversee laboratory operations, provide scientific oversighUguidance, mentor staff, support publication/presentation of results, and coordinate operations/analysis within HSRP and our collaborators. I have led HSRP laboratory activities for all network studies for the past three years, including MTN-026 and HPTN-083. Prior to joining HSRP, I developed and managed multi-site and international research studies leading to publication. I have more than 10 years of laboratory research experience in molecular techniques, microbiology, virology, and in vivo studies. Much of my research focused on the development and characterization of clinical interventions/medical countermeasures for emerging viral diseases, including in vivo efficacy testing. I provided scientific mentorship laboratory personnel and oversight for research and public health laboratory programs during the response to infectious disease, including the introduction of a novel diagnostic for clinical practice. I contributed (first or co-authorship) to published 17 research articles (additional publications in preparation) and more than 16 professional presentations. I have a strong interest in translational research of clinical interventions for infectious diseases, particularly viral diseases. I have the motivation, experience, and training to successfully execute the laboratory studies as well as contribute to the scientific development of the proposed project.

Contributions to Science 1. The development of non-human primate (NHP) models for emerging viral infections to study acute infection and evaluate experimental medical countermeasures. This research path began with Hendra and Nipah viruses; as the NHP model was required to meet the criteria established under the FDA two�animal rule for medical countermeasures to highly-pathogenic viruses. I developed and performed the molecular studies to characterize Nipah virus pathogenesis in NHPs, the first NHP model for a Henipavirus, as well as molecular assays used to develop the NHP model of Hendra virus infection. I managed and Page 150 BiosketchesContact PD/Pl: DASZAK, PETER performed a long-term study of the humeral responses to flaviviruses. This was the first NHP study examining antibody persistence over an extended period as well as only report to directly compare the acute infection and humeral responses to all four Dengue virus serotypes. I directed and performed an in vivo efficacy study of a novel EV-71 virus-like particle vaccine developed by our collaborators. These projects contributed novel tools for characterizing acute infection, further characterized host responses to these infectious agents, and established reproducible models for important viral illnesses. a.

The development of an experimental sub-unit vaccine and antibody therapeutic for Hendra and Nipah viruses, two highly-lethal emerging viruses. The sub-unit G vaccine and monclonal antibody therapy are the the most well-characterized experimental countermeasure and furthest advanced in the development process. The sub-unit Henipavirus G vaccine has been deployed as a standard equine vaccine in Australia and the monoclonal antibody has now been administered, under FDA's compassionate use provision, to more than 11 individuals exposed to Hendra virus. a.

I developed the largest monoclonal antibody panel specific for Henipavirus Attachment (G) Glycoproteins and used the panel to identify protective epitopes as well as structural features associated with the viral fusion mechanism. These monoclonal antibodies were developed using the same soluble Henipavirus G determinants included in experimental Henipavirus subunit vaccine(s) and were used to demonstrate a conserved antigenic structure between the soluble and native G glycoprotein. These studies identified protective epitopes not previously documented in the literature (publication in preparation) and the first to describe receptor-independent protective epitopes of Henipavirus G. I devised and performed molecular studies to show extensive structural changes in the G glycoprotein following receptor binding and found some of these changes present in unbound soluble G (additional publications in preparation). This discovery suggests soluble G assumes an intermediate receptor-bound structural configuration and could explain why crystal structures of paramyxovirus G glycoproteins have not exhibited Page 151 BiosketchesContact PD/Pl: DASZAK, PETER significant changes when co-cyrstalized with receptor. Refining the paramyxovirus fusion model can identify opportunities for developing clinical therapies to Henipaviruses and structures/functions common to other viruses that use a Type I viral fusion mechanism, such as HIV and Ebola virus. a.

I developed multi-site collaborative studies to identify emerging viruses and further define the epidemiology. I worked with a team of epidemiologists and laboratorians to use molecular techniques, including next generation sequencing, to uncover the epidemiologic relationships of a cluster of Ebola infections near Monrovia, Liberia. These data were used to improve the public health intervention and control further spread of the virus. I developed a reliable and adaptable assay for identifying Henipavirus-specific antibody responses and deployed the assay for field studies, uncovering serologic evidence of sporadic exposure to Nipah/Nipah-like virus among bats in China and school children in rural Thailand (publication in preparation). Notably, this was the northern most detection of the virus and the first identification of Henipaviruses in insectivorious bats. I contributed to serology screening to determine the incidence and rate of re-infection with human Metapneumovirus, a common childhood respiratory infection. While developing a Dengue research project, I discovered abnormal properties of a sylvatic Dengue virus isolate isolated from a Malaysian individual with severe disease. Studies of this isolate in NHPs elicited illnesses among animals previously challenged with another Dengue virus serotype and NHP antibody responses suggested the isolate was antigenically divergent to the other Dengue serotypes (publication in preparation). The unique attributes of this Dengue virus isolate have been confirmed by additional groups. These studies have contributed a better understanding of the viral ecology and occurrence of important paramyxo-, flavi-, and filoviruses. a.

My hybrid professional skills enable me to take a cross�disciplinary approach to the surveillance of wildlife populations, the identification of the origins of novel agents, and the elaboration of infection dynamics in reservoir and spillover host populations. I am recognized as an authority on EIDs associated with bats, having worked with the US Centers for Disease Control, the World Health Organization, and the UN Food and Agriculture Organization to find the origins of Nipah virus in Malaysia, SARS in China, and Reston ebolavirus in the Philippines. More recently, as Principal Research Scientist at the Queensland Centre for Emerging Infections Diseases, I was co-Pl on government and university-funded grants to elaborate Hendra virus infection and immune dynamics in the reservoir population, enabling more effective spillover risk management. The current proposal complements and substantially expands this approach in proposing to novel and powerful tools to understand how host immune dynamics and heterogeneity in immune response affect the timing, location, and severity of disease outbreaks in wildlife, and risk of spillover from wildlife to human populations. As a company Director, I also have strong management skills that translate to effective team, project, budget and report management. My affiliations with the University of Queensland and the University of Malaysia, Sabah support EID research capacity building. have a strong publication record, with over 120 peer-reviewed papers and numerous book chapters. 1.

Contributions to Science 1. Hendra virus research. My role in identifying species of bats (Chiroptera) as the natural reservoir of Hendra virus was a pivotal breakthrough in the subsequent realization of the unique role of this taxa as reservoirs for highly lethal zoonoses. The early work provided a model for the investigation of the origins of wildlife associated EIDS and facilitated effective surveillance strategies; the later work elaborated spatiotemporal patterns and informed more targeted risk mitigation strategies. a.

Beyond identifying the origins of the virus, the Nipah virus research focused on elaborating the ecology of infection in the natural host and drivers for emergence. Our Page 155 BiosketchesContact PD/Pl: DASZAK, PETER collaborative and cross-disciplinary approach to the research across human health, livestock health and environmental components has been widely adopted.

The early epidemiological investigation of SARS cases undertaken by our WHO team showed that the earliest human cases were associated with wet markets, and lead to the identification of civets and other traded species as the source of human infection. However, these species were not the natural reservoirs and as part of an international team, I played a key role in focusing research on bats in which we subsequently found ancestral SARS-like coronaviruses. This finding precipitated global surveillance of bats and lead to the discovery of a suite of coronaviruses in the taxa, and promoted broader pathogen discovery focus on bats. a.

I made significant contributions to the development of the research on ecosystem health, especially as it relates to biodiversity loss, land use change, disease emergence and their economic implications. I have published peer-reviewed papers in Nature, Nature Comm., Lancet, PNAS, mBio and others. I have advised the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services Intergovernmental Panel of Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), the United Nations - System of Environmental-Economic Accounting (UN-SEEA) and I chair the International Union of Conservation Nature (IUCN) Task Force on Human Health and Ecosystems Management. Over the past ten years, I supervised students and technical teams in Argentina, Bolivia, Malaysia, Mexico, Venezuela and the USA. I am is a key member of the Modeling and Analytics Team of the PREDICT Consortium, under the cooperative agreement for USAID's Emerging Pandemic Threats Program. I have designed and implemented the Deep Forest Project that evaluates how increasing land-use development affects biodiversity which in turn changes viral dynamics that could lead to disease emergence. This project has been implemented in Brazil, Malaysia and Uganda. Similarly, Dr. Zambrana-Torrelio is Key Personnel of the USAID Infectious Disease Emergence and Economics of Altered Landscapes (IDEEAL) team that examines how land-use change and economics of disease emergence can be used by local and regional decision makers.

Decanato de Estudios Graduados e lnvestigacion University of Puerto Rico C. Contributions to Science 1. Applications of ecological niche modeling in disease systems. Ecological niche modeling (ENM) is widely employed in ecology to predict species' potential geographic distributions in relation to their environmental constraints. This method is increasingly employed to prioritize geographic areas for disease surveillance and control under the assumption that the distribution of hosts is directly related to the distribution of pathogens. I applied EN Ms to predict the potential impact of future climate change on the distribution of Henipaviruses. We showed that Henipaviruses' hosts could potentially expand to new geographic areas in Africa and Southeast Asia. I further explored the main assumption of EN Ms in disease ecology: host distribution corresponds to pathogen distribution. Hosts may occur where parasites are absent, and even when infection occurs, disease may be absent. I developed an ecological framework to model the geography of disease transmission under the an ENM approach. This theoretical framework: (i) addresses the selection of an appropriate modeling approach and highlights the importance of including biologically sound predictor variables; (ii) proposes the concept of a microscale parasitic niche defined by host traits to identify relevant parasite-host associations; and (iii) integrates traditional parasite ENM with the proposed microscale niche to better understand geographic distributions and improve fine-scale predictions of disease transmission risk. a.

Linking biodiversity, human health and ecosystems. Human health is intimately interconnected with biodiversity and the health of our ecosystems. There are different ways in which biodiversity can provide health and wellbeing to humans, including psychological (e.g. mental health), physiological (e.g. food provision), and traditional and modem medicines. Another important benefit from biodiversity to human health is the capacity to regulate the transmission and prevalence of some infectious diseases. Over the past 5 years I have worked with environmental economists, disease ecologists and biodiversity researchers and developed an optimal land use planning framework that assess the costs and benefits of developing land. This framework allows to determine the optimal land conversion rate when considering the losses of ecosystem services and also the economic damages of disease emergence. I have tested this framework in Sabah, Malaysia and our results showed that the Malaysian government could potentially lose $US 748 million due to excessive land conversion over the next 30 years by not considering the economic damages of malaria. a.

One Health Economics to confront disease threats. Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg. 111 :235-237. 3. Impacts of land use change on the ecology of emerging infectious diseases. The majority of emerging infectious diseases since 1940 were caused by zoonotic pathogens. Over the past 5 years I developed and implemented a systematic sampling methodology to address the ecological factors that drive zoonotic disease emergence due to land-use change. Land-use change has been attributed to around 1/5 of all novel disease emergence events and around half of all zoonotic diseases. Land-use changes could modify the risk of cross-species transmission ("spillover") by perturbing the dynamics of pathogens in wildlife hosts and/or by bringing novel host-pathogen pairs (including humans) into unprecedented contact. This project was implemented across a range of biogeographical regions including the Neotropical region (Brazil), Afrotropical (Uganda) and the Oriental region (Malaysian Borneo). Sampling was focused on two high-risk groups: bats and rodents. a.

Senior/Key Personnel Ralph Barie, PhD Co-Investigator will commit (b)(4),(b)(6) to this project. Dr. Barie is a known expert in coronavirus cross species transmission and pathogenesis and has studied this group of viruses for over 30 years. His group developed the first reverse genetic systems for epidemic and zoonotic SARS-like and coronaviruses and they have studied the ability of these viruses to replicate efficiently in various primary human airway epithelial cell cultures as well as other key primary cell types. His group has also studied the sensitivity of these viruses to be controlled by existing vaccines and therapeutics both in vitro and in vivo. Dr. Barie will lead the studies at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He will design research strategies, interpret findings and review research outcomes with Dr. Sims and Mr. Yount. At a regular basis, Dr. Barie will report the results of the teams research to Dr. Daszak, and together, they will use this information to identify additional research priorities and design downstream studies. Ors. Daszak and Barie have published together in the past and participated on research project applications. He will work closely with Ors. Sims and Tse and Mr. Yount to prepare timely reports, share research and discuss future research directions with the group. Amy Sims, PhD co-Investigator will commit (b)(4),(b)(6) to this project. or. Sims has over 22 years of research studying coronavirus molecular biology, replication and pathogenesis. She has published over 50 papers including seminal papers on characterizing host response patterns of primary human lung airway epithelial cells and other cell types after infection with SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, influenza and various SARS�like bat coronaviruses. She is not only well versed in the preparation, cultivation and maintenance of primary human lung cells but also proficient at studying virus infection outcomes, in the presence and absence of antiviral therapeutics. She is also expert in coronavirus reverse genetics. In consultation with Dr. Barie, Dr. Sims will design experiments, perform infections and characterize epidemic and bat SARS-like coronavirus replication in human cells. She will compile data and share these results with the research team. Dr. Sims will also interface and work closely with Mr. Yount, who will assist in these studies, including infections, cell preparations and characterizing virus growth efficiency in these cultures. Dr. Sims has over 15 years of experience working in a BSL3 laboratory and oversees the management of these facilities. She has select agent clearance. B. Other Personnel Dr. Herman Tse, Research Associate will commit (b)(4),(b)(6) to this project. He is well trained in molecular biology, synthetic genome design, whole genome sequencing, virus reverse genetics using flaviviruses and coronaviruses as models, virus recovery and characterization in cell in culture. He is completed his training for BSL3 research over the next month and has select agent paperwork under review. He will work closely with Ors. Barie and Sims to design experiments, sequence novel virus isolates, and design and recovery recombinant viruses from molecular clones. He will report his findings to Dr. Barie and prepare reports and presentations regarding his research productivity during the course of the program. Mr. Boyd Yount Laboratory Technician will commit CbH4),(b)(6) to this project. Mr. Yount has published over 50 papers on coronaviruses and developed the first reverse genetic platforms for SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and various SARS-like bat coronaviruses.

Received Date: 2019-06·28T16:02:40.000-04:00Contact PD/Pl: DASZAK, PETER Southeast Asia is one of the world's highest-risk EID hotspots, and the origin of the SARS pandemic, repeated outbreaks of novel influenza strains and the spillover of dangerous viral pathogens such as Nipah virus. It is a wildlife 'megadiversity' region, where a rapidly expanding human population is increasing contact with wildlife, and increasing the risk of zoonotic disease outbreaks. The overarching goal of this proposal is to launch the gmerging !nfectious Qiseases - §outh gast Asia Research Collaboration Hub (EID-SEARCH) to analyze the diversity of key viral pathogens in wildlife, the frequency and causes of their spillover, and to identify viral etiologies of undiagnosed 'cryptic' outbreaks in people. EID-SEARCH includes leaders in the field of emerging viral pathogens at key US institutions, and in Thailand, Singapore, and the 3 major Malaysian administrative regions, whose collaborative networks span >50 clinics, laboratories, and research institutes across almost all SE Asian countries. This hub, and the network, will act as an early warning system for outbreaks - a way to exchange information, reagents, samples and technology, and a collaborative power-house for translational research. The long-term collaboration among the key personnel, and multidisciplinary skillsets from epidemiology, clinical management, lab analysis, through wildlife biology and data analysis will act as significant assets when deployed to help counter outbreaks in the region. The research goals of this EIDRC follow three specific aims: Specific Aim 1: Identify, characterize and rank spillover risk of high zoonotic potential viruses from wildlife. We will: 1) analyze some of the tens of thousands of archived wildlife samples at our disposal, conduct geographically- and taxonomically-targeted field surveillance in wild mammals (bats, rodents, primates), and use serological & PCR assays to identify known high-profile zoonotic pathogens, or close relatives with potential to infect people; 2) biologically characterize novel viruses that our analyses suggest have high spillover and pandemic potential; and 3) conduct in vitro receptor binding assays and cell culture experiments, and in vivo animal model infections using humanized mice and the collaborative cross mouse to assess their potential to infect people and cause disease. Specific Aim 2: Identify evidence and analyze risk factors for viral spillover in high-risk communities using novel serological assays. Assessing the spillover of rare or novel zoonotic agents will require targeted surveillance of high-risk communities and approaches that can deal with the low statistical probability of identifying rare events. To achieve this, we will 1) conduct targeted cross-sectional serological surveys of human communities with extremely high geographic and cultural, occupational and behavioral exposure to wildlife-origin viruses; 2) design and deploy novel serological assays to identify baseline spillover of known or novel CoVs, PMVs and FVs in these populations; and 3) analyze and test hypotheses on the occupational, cultural and other risk factors for spillover (e.g. hunting wildlife). Specific Aim 3: Identify and characterize viral etiology of 'cryptic' outbreaks in clinical cohorts. Our prior work provides substantial evidence of spillover leading to undiagnosed illness in people in the region. To test if these represent 'cryptic' outbreaks of novel viruses, we will conduct syndromic surveillance at regional clinics for the communities sampled in SA2. We will: 1) enroll and collect biological samples, and detailed survey data on risk factors, from patients presenting with influenza-like illness, severe respiratory illness, encephalitis, and other specific symptoms; 2) conduct molecular and follow-up serological diagnostic assays to test causal links between their syndromes and known and novel viral agents identified in SA 1. Where viruses are identified, we will attempt to isolate and characterize them, then use the survey data, ecological and phylogenetic analyses to identify likely reservoir hosts/spillover pathways and inform intervention programs. This research will advance our understanding of the risk of novel viral emergence in a uniquely important region. It will strengthen in-country research capacity by linking local infectious disease scientists with an international collaborative network that has proven capacity to conduct this work and produce significant findings. These include: testing of tens of thousands of samples from wildlife, humans and livestock in the region; discovery of hundreds of novel viruses from zoonotic viral families in wildlife; outbreak investigations in rural communities across SE Asia; discovery of the bat-origin of SARSr-CoVs; discovery of a novel bat-origin SADS-CoV killing >25,000 pigs in S. China; and development of novel serological and molecular assays for high-impact viruses, and state-of-the-art in vitro and in vivo assays to characterize viral pathogenic potential. This body of collaborative research provides proof-of-concept that EID-SEARCH has the background, collaborative network, experience, and skillset to act as a unique early warning system for novel EIDs of any etiology threatening to emerge in this hottest of the EID hotspots. Page 276 Specific AimsContact PD/Pl: DASZAK, PETER II. Research Strategy: 1. Significance: Southeast Asia is a critical hotspot for emerging diseases due to its high biodiversity of wildlife and their viruses, and the presence of key ecological and socioeconomic drivers of emergence (Fig. 1) (1). These include dense human populations living in networks of rural and urban communities, with strong cultural and occupational connection to wildlife and livestock farming and trading, and intimate connection to global travel networks (2). The region is undergoing rapid environmental and demographic change, both of which increase the risk of disease emergence and spread. Pathogens that emerge in this region often spread and sometimes enter the USA (e.g. prior influenza pandemics, SARS) and threaten global health security. ' D Fig. 1: Southeast Asia, and in particular, parts of Thailand and Malaysia are hotspots of risk for disease emergence (left), and predicted high diversity of 'missing' or as-yet undiscovered viruses, yellow = highest diversity (left). From ( 1-3). Not surprisingly novel viruses, including near�neighbors of known agents, have emerged in the region leading to often unusual clinical presentations (Table 1).This adds to a significant background burden of repeated Dengue virus outbreaks in the region (20), and over 30 known Flavivirus species circulating throughout S. and SE Asia (21). The events in Table 1 are dominated by three viral families: coronaviruses (CoVs), paramyxoviruses {PMVs - particularly henipaviruses) and filoviruses (FVs), which are initial examples of our team's research focus and capabilities. These viral groups have led to globally important emerging zoonoses (4, 5, 22-31), causing tens of thousands of deaths, and costing billions of dollars (32-34). Furthermore, near-neighbors of known pathogens in these families have been reported throughout the region, including by members of our consortium: henipaviruses in bats in Thailand, Cambodia, Philippines, Laos, Indonesia, China, Malaysia, Bangladesh and India (35-41); a novel henipavirus, Mojiang virus, in wild rats in Yunnan (14); serological evidence of FVs in bats in Bangladesh ( 42) and Singapore ( 43); Nipah- and Ebola-like viruses in Hipposideros, Cynopterus and Rhinolophus species in Malaysia (Hughes et al., in prep.); evidence of novel FVs in bats in China (44-46), including Mengla virus Viral agent Nipah virus Melaka & Kampar virus Reston filovirus Thrombocytopenia Syndrome virus Reston filovirus Mojiang virus Nipah-like virus SARSr-CoV & HKU10-CoV SADS-CoV Nipah virus Site, date Malaysia, Singapore 1998-9 Malaysia 2006 Philippines 2008 E.

China that occur throughout the region (24, 49, 51, 52); 9 novel wildlife-origin CoVs and 27 PMVs in Thailand, and 9 novel CoVs in Malaysia reported by us from USAID-PREDICT funding (51, 53). These discoveries underscore the clear and present danger of zoonotic events in the region. The wide diversity of potentially pathogenic viral strains also has significant potential use in broadly active vaccine, immunotherapeutic and drug development (49). Most high-impact zoonotic viruses originate in wildlife reservoirs, sometimes spilling over first into livestock 'amplifier' hosts. or directly into localized human populations with high levels of animal contact (Fig. 2). Efforts to prevent emerging zoonoses have targeted these high-risk populations in regions prone to disease emergence (31, 54). However, these regions tend to be in the developing world, where nations often lack the resources to investigate novel zoonotic events, or wildlife reservoirs of zoonoses, and prioritize more immediate public health concerns such as Dengue virus or NTDs (20). Zoonotic disease surveillance and control is also hampered by inadequate information on basic disease ecology (e.g. range of wildlife reservoirs, risk factors for spillover) and pathogen biology (viral diversity, pathogenesis), and by logistical challenges sharing novel diagnostics, animal models, samples and reagents at sites where outbreaks begin (55). Countermeasure and vaccine development is challenged by the small number of isolates available, and the presence of closely-related strains. some with evidence of transmission to people but with unknown pathogenicity. For example, using NIH and other funding, we found serological evidence of exposure to African henipaviruses in 3-4% of a sample of people in Cameroon, with a significant risk factor being butchering of bats; and serological responses to bat SARSr-CoVs in 6/209 (2.87%) and bat HKU10-CoV in 2/412 (0.5%) people living close to a bat cave in Yunnan, all novel viruses with unknown clinical impact (16, 56). We discovered two novel bat-borne reoviruses, Melaka and Pulau viruses, and showed that 14/109 (13%) of people living in close proximity to bat roosts on Tioman Island, Malaysia were exposed to these viruses (7) as well as 12/856 ( 1.4 % ) of a random sample screened in Singapore ( 8). Previous studies in the Philippines found famers and butchers who had contact with sick pigs tested positive for Reston ebolavirus antibodies but had not experienced illness ( 11). and it was our team that discovered Philippine bats as natural reservoir hosts for Reston virus (57). In preliminary screening in Malaysia with funding from DTRA we found serological evidence of exposure to henipaviruses (Hendra, Nipah and Cedar) in 14 bats and 6 human samples, and Ebola (Zaire and Sudan)-related viruses in 11 bats, 2 non-human primates (NHP) and 3 human samples (Hughes, in prep.). PANDEMIC EMERGENCE lnternollonol Travel and Trade LOCALIZED EMERGENCE Expansion of the Wildlife-Human Interface Even when spillover leads to outbreaks of illness and mortality, they are often unreported, undiagnosed or misdiagnosed. We initiated targeted syndromic surveillance of encephalitis patients in Bangladesh clinics and showed that Nipah virus (NiV) causes repeated annual outbreaks with an overall mortality rate of -70% (58). NiV has been reported in people in West Bengal, India, which borders Bangladesh (28), in bats in Central North India (59), and now in people in Kerala, South India in 2018 and 2019, raising the specter of future spillover at other sites in the region ( 18, 60). Fig. 2: Our Early Warning Approach: Most zoonotic viruses emerge from wildlife hosts, sometimes via livestock (lower panel), to cause small scale outbreaks (green) or larger chains (red} of human-to-human transmission (middle). In some cases, these spread more widely via air travel (upper). Our EIDRC proposal targets each stage: SA 1 examines the diversity and spillover potential of viral threats in targeted SE Asian wildlife; SA2 seeks evidence of their spillover into focused high-risk human populations; SA3 identifies their capacity to cause illness and to spread more widely. Figure from (54). Under a current N IAI D R01, we have shown that we can use analytical approaches to target surveillance of wildlife and people and identify likely sites of spillover. We used phylogenetic analysis of bat hosts and their CoVs to identify a key cave complex in SW Yunnan Province that harbors all the genetic elements of SARS�CoV (61), as well as a series of SARSr-CoVs that can infect human cells in vitro, cause SARS-like clinical signs in humanized mice, and evade vaccine treatment and therapeutics (24, 49, 51, 52, 62-64). We conducted risk factor surveys and biological sampling of human populations living close to this cave and found serological evidence of spillover in people highly exposed to wildlife (16). This work provides proof-of�2 Page 278 Research StrategyContact PD/Pl: DASZAK, PETER concept for an early warning approach that we will expand in this EIDRC to target other viral groups in one of the world's most high-risk EID hotspots. The overall premise of this EIDRC proposal is that there is substantial evidence that: 1) diverse CoVs, henipaviruses and FVs related to known human pathogens are circulating in wildlife reservoirs in Southeast Asia; 2) these viruses likely spillover regularly to people, are often unreported or misdiagnosed, and their clinical manifestations and potential to cause pandemics are unknown and underestimated; and 3) our strategy for targeted surveillance and detection of spillover and illness in at-risk human populations can be used as an 'early warning system' to conduct public health interventions and disrupt disease emergence. To scale-up this approach, we propose to launch EID-SEARCH (the gmerging !nfectious Diseases - §outh gast Asia Research Collaboration f::!ub ), to better understand, and respond to, the risk of zoonotic viral emergence in Southeast Asia. We will initially focus on the diversity of known and novel CoVs, henipaviruses, and FVs in wildlife reservoirs. We will use this work to build our center's interactive network throughout the region, bridge barriers, provide early focal point for basic and translational studies, develop sample handling and storage routines, communication networks, cohort management, infrastructure development, and cross-training in surveillance and novel diagnostic platforms. We will develop and transfer technology to test these viruses' capacity to infect human cells and mouse models, develop new specific and sensitive serological and molecular diagnostic tools, conduct surveillance of human communities with high risk of exposure to wildlife, and clinical cohorts to identify evidence of spillover of viruses causing previously 'cryptic' clinical syndromes in people. We will test the capacity of novel viruses to infect human cells and/or mouse models, and thus asses potential for spillover and spread which will feed into our risk models. Our group also has extensive experience in other viruses, including vector-borne flaviviruses, and alphaviruses, and will use this experience to provide robust long-term surveillance, diagnostics, and basic science opportunities. While the current proposal focuses its basic and applied research agendas on this group of viral EID, we note that the EID-SEARCH is poised to rapidly respond to any outbreak. Thus, FVs, henipaviruses and Co Vs are examples of sentinel surveillance systems in place that illustrate EID-SEARCH's capacity to identify and initiate a rapid response targeting any novel microbial pathogen that emerges in this region. 2. Innovation: Previous work by our consortium has developed strategies to target surveillance in wildlife and people to better anticipate and identify early spillover events and pre-empt outbreaks of emerging viruses. In the EID-SEARCH we scale up this approach in a central research "hub" made up of leading laboratories, clinics and surveillance sites in three critically high-risk EID hotspot countries in SE Asia. EID-SEARCH's reach is expanded through its regional network of collaborators that covers nearly all of the greater SE Asia region. The innovation of the EID-SEARCH is in: 1) Its multidisciplinary approach that combines modeling to target geographic and taxonomic sampling targets with on-the-ground zoonotic disease surveillance in human and wildlife populations; 2) the biological characterization approach that identifies how likely viruses are to be able to infect people, and enables evaluation of existing countermeasure technologies; an approach that is grounded in our successful work on SARSr-CoVs; and 3) the strategic sampling of both high-risk communities with extensive animal contact at the front-lines of viral spillover and syndromic clinical cohorts that present with signs of novel viral emergence, to identify risk of viral spillover in an early warning system approach (Fig. 2). In Aim 1, we will target viruses in archived and newly collected wildlife samples, and characterize their risk of spillover to people. We will use spatial and phylogeographic analyses to identify the geography and species of wildlife to test samples from, and to further characterize viruses we have recently discovered. We will use in silica methods (novel ecological-phylogenetic risk ranking and mapping of receptor binding domains), cell culture, and animal models to assess their potential for spillover into high-risk human populations. In Aim 2, we will conduct targeted cross-sectional serological surveys of human communities with high levels of animal contact to find evidence of viral spillover, and identify occupational and other risk factors for zoonotic virus transmission. We will use serological tests targeting viruses identified in Aim 1 to identify the baseline spillover of known or novel CoVs, henipaviruses and FVs in these populations. Serological findings will be analyzed together with subject metadata (including a simple animal-contact survey, location data, viral sequence/isolates etc.) to identify zoonotic risk factors and routes of exposure from specific wildlife or vector species. In Aim 3, we will use syndromic surveillance of clinical human cohorts to identify evidence of viral etiology for otherwise 'cryptic' outbreaks. We will enroll and 3 Page 279 Research StrategyContact PD/Pl: DASZAK, PETER collect biological samples from patients in local clinics and hospitals who present with syndromes previously linked to known viral agents and live within communities at high risk for disease emergence. We will conduct molecular and follow-up serological diagnostic assays to identify likely viral etiology of syndromes that may represent otherwise cryptic events. Where viruses are identified, we will attempt to isolate or molecularly re�derive them, and use survey data, ecological and phylogenetic analysis to identify likely reservoir hosts and inform intervention programs. Our US partner BSL-4 laboratory, NEIDL, will attempt isolation and characterization of viruses requiring BSL-4 of containment (e.g. novel filoviruses, close relatives of Hev/NiV). 3. Approach: 3.1. Research team: The EID-SEARCH builds on long-term collaboration among world leaders in emerging virus research with proven experience collaborating internationally on field, lab and human surveillance research (Fig. 3). Over the past two decades, our consortium partners have conducted high profile research on EIDs within the region and globally, including identifying the wildlife reservoirs for NiV and Hendra virus (HeV), MERS- and SARS-CoVs (24, 27, 59, 61, 65-67), discovering SADS-CoV (17), and developing an array of serological, molecular, in vitro and in vivo approaches to characterizing high-risk CoVs, henipaviruses, and FVs (62-64, 68-81). Our team has substantial experience conducting human surveillance in the community and during outbreaks (Sections 2.2.a., 2.2.b., 2.2.c, 3.2.a, 3.2.b), including: USAID-PREDICT, and DTRA�funded viral surveillance of indigenous communities in Peninsular Malaysia and syndromic surveillance of hospital patients in Sabah (Co-I Hughes); collection of >2,000 serum samples from healthy blood donors and sanitation workers, febrile and influenza like illness (ILi), and diarrheal stool samples from children under 5 years of age across Borneo Malaysia (Co-I Kamruddin); collaboration on the MONKEYBAR project with the AIM 2: COMMUNITY ........

Geographical focus: The three core (hub) countries for this proposed EIDRC are Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore, three contiguous EID hotspot countries that stretch through one of the most significant foci of EID origins globally. Our proposed work includes sampling wildlife and people in Thailand, Peninsular Malaysia, Sarawak and Sabah, and thus contains overlapping wildlife biogeography with India, Bangladesh, Myanmar, SW China, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, Philippines, and Indonesia. It encompasses diverse cultural and socioeconomic backgrounds which have correspondingly diverse and intensive interactions with wildlife reservoirs and the global travel network. We have already begun sampling of wildlife hunters, livestock workers, wildlife farmers and market workers, rural villagers living close to high risk wildlife species, people otherwise highly exposed to animals in these countries, and clinical cohorts, as part of current/prior NIH, DTRA, and USAID funding. Our core member's extensive network of collaborators in clinics, research institutes and public health laboratories in almost every other Southeast Asian country positions the EID-SEARCH within a much larger catchment area for emerging zoonoses and will allow us to rapidly scale up to include additional sites in response to an outbreak or shift in research priorities. We will conduct regular meetings with key research, public health and community leaders, including >50 leading laboratories/institutions in 10 countries (Section 4.2) to maintain these collaborative relationships with the core members of our consortium (Fig. 4 ). ,_ SRJlANKA ' - EJD-SEARCH Core Coantrlt$ '•., - COllabOnlUng Pl!rtneis f ,~ .. - .,; INDONESIA ' ..••• ,,,.,,.r·-; We will use these, and our annual meetings, to share information on novel research and diagnostic approaches, pathogens that are of key pandemic potential, regions or populations at high risk of spillover, and information from the greater network on likely outbreaks of novel disease.

Capacity for linkage with other NIAID studies, and scaling up to respond to outbreaks: EID-SEARCH US-based partners include senior scientists with significant experience on NIAID-funded projects, extensive collaborations with other NIAID-funded scientists, and previous experience working with NIAID leadership through workshops, review of programs (e.g. Pl Daszak's role in NIAID CEIRS external review), and work on study sections. These contacts ensure that the EID-SEARCH senior leadership will be ready and able to rapidly set up data, sample and reagent/assay sharing protocols with NIAID researchers, the other EIDRCs, the EIDRC CC and other NIAID research centers. EID-SEARCH in-country partners include senior medical doctors and infectious disease specialists at national and regional hospitals in each country and administrative state in this proposal. On news of potential outbreaks, EID-SEARCH will rapidly mobilize its core staff and their extensive collaborative network across almost all SE Asian countries (Fig. 4) (Sections 4.1.a, 4.2. 4.3). The core analytical approach can be used to rapidly identify sampling sites and targets to harvest vectors, vector borne arboviruses, birds and mammalian species that harbor most other viral threats. Through existing projects such as the USAID PREDICT Project and DTRA-funded biosurveillance projects, EHA is currently partnered with hospitals and researchers across South and Western Asia. West and Central Africa, and Latin America. Our partners already have capacity to conduct human and wildlife sampling and testing for novel viral agents, so expanding in geography or scale is readily achievable given sufficient resources. Aim 1: Identify, characterize and rank spillover risk of high zoonotic potential viruses from wildlife. 1.1 Rationale/Innovation: The vast majority of emerging zoonotic pathogens are linked directly or indirectly to wildlife host, particularly from important mammalian groups like bats, rodents and NHPs (3). Our previous work on wildlife origin viruses demonstrates that zoonotic viral emergence tends to occur in specific regions with high diversity of wildlife that harbor viruses of zoonotic potential, and human populations that have close contact to these wildlife (Fig. 1) (2, 3). In Aim 1 (see Fig. 9 for overview), we will strategically conduct EID 5 Page 281 Research StrategyContact PD/Pl: DASZAK, PETER surveillance by applying risk analytics to prioritize the regions, wildlife species, and human populations that have a particularly high risk of viral spillover. We will target high-risk zoonotic host reservoirs (bats, rodents and NHPs) in these regions and apply novel predictive models to estimate viral diversity and host range to identify wildlife species that have been ignored or under-sampled by previous zoonotic disease surveillance efforts. We will strategically collect specimens from these species and screen them, together with some of the tens of thousands of recently collected samples we have archived, for known and novel agents. We will begin screening using conserved PCR assays to identify known and novel viruses in high risk RNA viral families, Coronaviridae, Paramyxoviridae, and Fitoviridae. We will expand to other groups of pathogens, including arboviruses, pending available resources and priorities established with the EIDRC coordinating center (EIDRC-CC) and other regional EIDRCs. Using risk ranking algorithms and a series of ecological and virological risk factors, we will triage the wildlife viruses we discover for further genomic characterization and viral isolation. On this subset of viruses, we will then use in vitro and in vivo approaches (viral rescue, cell lines, gene edited humanized transgenic mice and the collaborative cross genetic reference mouse population) previously developed and widely used by our team to predict capacity of novel viruses to infect people and spillover (63, 85-88). These high-risk viruses and their close relatives will be targets for human community serosurveys and clinical sampling in Aims 2 and 3. respectively. 1.2 Preliminary data: 1.2.a. Geographic targeting: EHA has led the field in analyzing where the highest risk of zoonotic spillover is across the globe, identifying SE Asia as a major EID hotspot (1, 2). These hotspots are sites where high wildlife biodiversity, human population density and rapid ecologic change collide (Fig 1). Using host and ICTV viral data for all known mammalian viruses, and generalized additive models to correct for sampling bias, we are able to predict the relative number of yet-to-be-described viruses that a species harbors (3). This demonstrates substantial undiscovered viral diversity in mammals across Southeast Asia, and particularly in regions of Thailand, Singapore and Malaysia (Fig. 1). Separately, we found that factors driving spillover (host diversity, climate) differ from those driving spread in human populations (population density, bushmeat hunting, livestock production) (89). We therefore analyze capacity for viral spread as a separate risk factor, using our unique demographic and air travel and flight data modeling software (90, 91). In the current proposed work, we will use all the above approaches to target wildlife sampling (archival and new field collections) in Aim 1, to inform sites for human sampling in Aim 2, and to assess risk of spread in Aim 3. 1.2.b. Reservoir host species targeting: Our analysis of all known mammalian host-viral associations demonstrates that bats, rodents and NHPs represent the three most important reservoirs for zoonoses, responsible for the highest proportion of known and predicted viral diversity of zoonotic potential (3). Thus, the bulk of our proposed wildlife sampling and testing will consist of these three taxa with a focus on bats, because this group is the known or hypothesized reservoir for the majority of high-impact zoonotic CoVs, PMVs and FVs (50, 92-94). Bats have the highest proportion of predicted zoonotic viruses in any mammalian group (2), and are exceedingly diverse in Southeast Asia (~500 species). To further prioritize taxonomic sampling targets within these diverse geographic hotspots, we used a novel Bayesian phylogeographic algorithm to identify host genera and species that are the most important centers of evolutionary diversity for a given viral group, e.g. bat genera for 13-CoVs (Fig. 5) (51). This approach will be extended to other mammal taxa and viral families of Hipposld•ro• interest. allowing us to identify the reservoir hosts of specific zoonotic viral vespor1;110 groups, where viral diversity is likely highest.

Epttslcus Hypsugo Rouserrus Mogr,o,ops Fig 5: Preliminary analysis of sequence data collected under prior NIH funding, identifying SE Asian bat genera with the highest 13-CoV evolutionary diversity. We will apply this Bayesian discrete phylogeographic model to identify taxonomic and geographic centers of viral diversification and sharing for relevant PMV, CoV, FV and other virus clades. Line thickness proportional to probability of virus sharing between two genera. Inter-family switches in red. Finally, we have designed a strategy to estimate sampling gaps, using a viral 'mark-recapture' approach we previously published (95, 96) (Fig. 6). Using prior data for bat, rodent and NHP viral discovery vs. sampling rates, we can identify the likely total viral diversity for specific host groups in a region, and use this to estimate sample sizes to discovering the majority of unknown viruses within a specific family or genus. In the current 6 Page 282 Research StrategyContact PD/Pl: DASZAK, PETER proposal, we will use these analyses to estimate geographic and species-specific sampling targets to more effectively identify new strains to support experimental infection studies and risk assessment. ·f20 t: r·~~-:-.- ... _·_____ _ ~ e s 8 0 0 2500 5000 7500 10000 Number of specimens !iMY b.ata MY rodents •TH bats TH rodents c:- -~30 ~ 1:~---··_· .. -············ I!! c..

Bats have 4X more viral species than rodents, controlling for sampling effort. We estimate that additional collection of 5k-9k bat specimens and testing of our archived bat and rodent specimens alone will identify >80% of remaining CoV and PMV viral species in these key reservoirs, yielding >800 unique viral strains. 1.2.c. Sample testing to identify known and novel viruses: We have conducted extensive wildlife surveillance for novel viruses across Southeast Asia in prior NIAID funded work and as part of the USAID PREDICT project. Under the 10-year PREDICT program globally, we identified 912 novel and 210 known viruses, more than the total number of viruses previously recognized in mammals by the ICTV (97). This work included collecting nearly 300,000 individual mammal samples from 14 EHA-led PREDICT countries, and PCR-screening of more than 60,000 individual specimens (53). In southern China alone, we identified 178 13- CoVs, of which 172 were novel, discovered a new 13-CoV clade, "lineage E" (41 ), diverse HKU3r-CoVs (179 sequences) within a 'sister' clade to the SARS-CoV lineage, and a new bat-origin SADS-CoV, responsible for killing >25,000 pigs in Guangdong Province (17). We have collected 28,957 samples from bats, rodents and NHPs in Thailand and 47,178 in Malaysia, but have only tested a minority of these using PCR. We have identified 100 novel viruses in Thailand and 77 in Malaysia. Furthermore, we have only sequenced a small segment of one gene for all novel viruses found. We have archived duplicate samples which are now available for use in this project, including fecal, oral, urogenital, serum samples, and biopsies from bats, rodents, and NHPs. In the current proposed work, we will attempt to sequence, isolate and characterize those viruses that our analyses below suggest are most likely to be able to infect humans. 1.2.d. In vitro & in vivo characterization of viral potential for human infection: Using Coronaviridae as an example, we have conducted in vitro and in vivo experiments to characterize the pathogenic potential of novel SARSr-CoVs from bats. We isolated three SARSr-CoVs from bat feces: WIV1, WIV16 and Rs487 4, with Spike (S) protein sequences that diverged from SARS-CoV by 3-7% (24, 61, 98). We conducted full-length genome sequencing of 12 other novel SARSr-CoVs, some highly similar to outbreak SARS-CoV in the most variable genes (61). Using our reverse genetics system we constructed chimeric viruses and rederived full length recombinant SARSr-CoV from in silco sequence. All 3 SARSr-CoV full length isolates and the two chimeric viruses replicated efficiently in Vero E6 cells and in Hela cells expressing hACE2, civet and bat ACE2, but not in those without ACE2 (24, 61, 98). We used the SARS-CoV reverse genetics system (72) to generate a chimeric virus with a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV backbone expressing SHC014 S protein with 10% sequence divergence from SARS-CoV S. This and the other full length and chimera viruses replicated in primary human airway epithelium, using the human ACE2 receptor to enter into cells (62). Thus, SARSr-CoVs with diverse variants of SL-CoV S protein without deletions in their RBD can use human ACE2 as receptor for cell entry. The Barie lab has a well-established hACE2 and DPP4 transgenic mouse model that we used to assess the capacity of novel SARSr-CoVs and MERS-CoV to infect humans and cause disease (85, 99). Infection of bat SARSr-SHC014 or WIV1 caused SARS-like clinical signs in the transgenic hACE2 mouse model that weren't reduced by immune-therapeutic monoclonals that attenuate SARS-CoV pathogenicity, nor after challenge following vaccination against SARS-CoV (62) (Fig. 7).

The broad mammalian tropism of HeV and NiV (68) is likely mediated by their usage of highly conserved ephrin ligands for cell entry (19, 100). A third isolated henipavirus, Cedar virus does not cause pathogenesis in animal models. Co-ls Broder and Laing have developed a reverse genetics system and rescued a recombinant CedV to test ephrin receptor usage/tropism and pathogenicity during henipavirus infections (77). CedV is unable to use the Ephrin-B3 receptor (77, 101) which is found in spinal cord and may underlie NiV encephalitis (102) and that pathogenesis also involves virulence factors V and W proteins. The putative henipaviruses, Ghana virus and M6Jiang virus, predict V and W protein expression, with GhV able to bind to ephrin-B2, but not -B2 (103), and the receptor for MoJV remains unknown (104) but is likely ephrin-B2 ( 105). Our group has also used similar methods to test the hypothesis that novel Filoviruses discovered in wildlife are able to infect people. NiV, EBOV and MERS-CoV all infect primary microvascular endothelial cells, which are available at Co-I Baric's lab for EID-SEARCH collaborators (71, 106). Primary human lung endothelial cells are highly susceptible to Ebolavirus infection (107), and Huh? cells can be used to isolate virus from clinical samples (108) offering advantages for reverse genetic recovery of novel FVs (109). The three filovirus genera, Ebola virus, Marburgvirus and Cuevavirus, use Niemann-Pick type C1 (NPC1) protein as cell entry receptor (110). For novel filoviruses, cell culture would be carried out under BSL-4, however they can readily be characterized following identification of their encoded GP sequences which can be pseudotyped into recombinant GP-bearing vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) pseudovirions ( 111 ). These pseudovirions can be safely used to characterize the tropism and entry filoviruses mediated by GP without a need for BSL4 containment. Co-ls Wang and Anderson used cells originating from various mammalian species to determine spillover and/or zoonotic potential of MLAV, a newly discovered Asian filovirus (47). Despite the low amino acid sequence identity (22-39%) of the glycoprotein with other filoviruses, MLAV is capable of using NPC1 as entry receptor. Cells from humans, monkeys, dogs, hamsters and bats were able to be infected with a MLAV pseudovirus, implying a broad species cell tropism with a high risk of interspecies spillover transmission. Mouse models. For novel viruses across all families, we will use the UNC collaborative cross mouse that captures 90% of the diversity within all mouse groups to assess the most suitable model for further experiments ( 112). We have used this model for CoV, FV (Ebola), Flaviviruses, and alphaviruses infections. Clinical signs such as weight loss, hemorrhage, encephalitis, and, acute or chronic arthritis were recapitulated in these mice following SARS, EBOV, West Nile virus and Chikungunya infections, respectively (86-88, 113- 116). Note that CC OR3015 shows hemorrhagic disease phenotypes after EBOV infection (Fig. 8). Bat Models. Duke-NUS has developed two models for bat in vivo studies: a colony of Eonycteris spetaea (cave A _,.,, 0 ......,.., dwelling small fruit bat) and a bat mouse model, which contains the bat immune system in an immunodeficient mouse ( 117). In a proof of concept study, Co-ls Wang and Anderson infected E. spelaea bats with MERS�CoV to demonstrate their susceptibility and suitability for infection with a bat borne virus under BSL3 containment. These bats and the bat mouse model will serve to complement and expand studies from the UNC collaborative cross mouse, pending further funding from EIDRC CC. Recombinant viruses, transgenic mouse models and experimental recombinant protein constructs described above will be made available to the EID-SEARCH consortium and other EIDRCs following standard procedures (see Resource Sharing Plan).

General Approach: We will conduct analyses to geographically- and taxonomically-target testing of samples from wild mammals that are most likely to harbor known high-profile zoonotic pathogens. or close relatives with potential to infect people. This includes selecting from tens of thousands of samples collected on recent projects and stored in freezers in our laboratories, and new sampling of wildlife in high risk locales. We will use viral family level PCR assays to identify and partially characterize viruses, then follow up sequencing of relevant receptor binding proteins to assess homology and predict binding affinity, then attempt to isolate and 8 Page 284 Research StrategyContact PD/Pl: DASZAK, PETER biologically characterize viruses that phylogenetic and other data suggest have high spillover and pandemic potential. We will follow this with in vitro binding assays and cell culture experiments. and in vivo animal model infections to assess their potential to infect people and cause disease (Fig. 9). EHA will lead the study design, targeted sampling, and data analysis; Co-ls Hughes and Wacharapluesadee will lead field sampling and in�country testing; Duke-NUS, UNC, USUS will lead the serological and PCR diagnostic development and the in vitro and in vivo analyses, as well as cross-training and tech transfer to the hub labs in Thailand and Malaysia. This will include via support of one Malaysian Ph.D student. Mei-Ho Lee (CM Ltd.) who has worked with the EID-SEARCH collaborators for 9 years.

Geographic and taxonomic targeting for newly collected wildlife samples: We will ■ • ~ • prioritize sites within each country that •-----------• rank highest for both the risk of zoonotic disease emergence (2) and the predicted number of 'missing' zoonotic viruses (3). Our preliminary analysis (Fig. 1) suggests priority areas include: the Kra Isthmus (S. Thailand) and adjacent forests in N. Peninsular Malaysia, NW Thailand (near the Myanmar-Laos border), and lowland rainforests of Sarawak and Sabah. In each of these 'hottest of the hotspots' regions, we will identify 2-4 distinct sampling sites based on the geographic distribution of key hosts we prioritize for additional wildlife sampling. We will priority rank bat, rodent. and NHP species using host trait-based models (3). We will also identify species predicted to be centers of evolutionary diversity for Co Vs, PMVs, and FVs using ancestral host reconstruction of available sequence data and Bayesian discrete phylogeographic models ( 118-120). We will leverage our strong collaborations with wildlife experts in Malaysia and Thailand, including many of whom are based at our core partner institutions, to ground-truth geographic and taxonomic model outputs with local expert knowledge to ensure the sampling plan is realistic based on current species distributions, population size estimates, seasonality, and accessibility to sites. Most zoonotic viruses are naturally carried by multiple wildlife host species, and there are strong, predictable relations between host phylogeny and viral taxonomy (3). We will use a combined network analysis and phylogeographic model to rapidly predict and prioritize new (unsampled) hosts for important, novel viruses we discover during our research. We have shown this relatively simple model (using just wildlife species range overlap and phylogenetic similarity between host species) is both generalizable to estimate host range for all mammalian and avian viruses and robust - accurately predicting hosts 98% of the time when cross-validated using data from known viruses (121). 1.4.b. Sample size justifications for testing new and archived wildlife specimens: We calculate initial sample sizes targets using our preliminary data on average PCR prevalence from screening tens of thousands of bat, rodent and NHP specimens for CoV and PMVs based on previous studies in Malaysia and Thailand. We will refine these sample size targets, in real-time, over the course of our project using viral discovery curve analyses (Fig. 6) to either scale-up or scale-back new sampling and testing of archived specimens for each species depending on viral capture rates. We will only collect additional specimens projected from each prioritized taxa to achieve statistically robust sample sizes and to complement our archived specimens. For example, Rousettus spp. bats, known FV reseNoirs, were not adequately sampled under PREDICT research in Thailand. Preliminary analysis indicates that, for all viral target families, we will require ~14,000 new samples to identify 80% of remaining viral species diversity in our study region, ~5,000 samples from Thailand and ~9,000 samples from Malaysia (Fig. 10). Viral strain diversity from a sampling effort this size is expected to number in the hundreds of strains. For example, given ~6% prevalence of Co Vs in bat species previously sampled under the PREDICT project, a target of 14,000 individuals would yield ~800 PCR positive individuals, 9 Page 285 Research StrategyContact PD/Pl: DASZAK, PETER representing, an estimated ~600 novel sequences/strains. Similarly, for PMVs, which have an average PCR detection prevalence of ~1.5%, sampling of 14,000 individuals would yield ~200 positives and an estimated 150 unique strains. Filovirus estimates are not feasible yet due to the small number of positive samples in prior Sampling needed tor 80% of viral diversity studies, but will be estimated as the project begins. From each mammal, we Coronaviruses Paramyxoviruses 15000 </) l~1.I . . I. will collect serum, whole blood, throat swabs, urine and fecal samples or rectal swab using our previously-validated nondestructive methods. We will sample sites at different time-points throughout each year, and sample an l remalning collected equal number of males and females to account for seasonal or sex-specific differences viral shedding (See Vertebrate Animals) (122, 123). Dead or animals euthanized due to injury will be necropsied. Fig. 10: Stacked bar plot showing number of currently-archived specimens (blue) and new specimens required (orange) to discover 80% of predicted number of CoVs and PMV species from high-risk bat and rodent taxa in Malaysia and Thailand. 1.4.c. Sample collection, testing, viral isolation: Wildlife will be captured and sampled using previously published techniques, by personnel wearing appropriate personal protective equipment (Tyvek suits or dedicated long external clothing, double nitrile gloves, leather gloves, an N95 or p100 respirator, and safety glasses) (53, 93, 95, 96, 122, 124). All samples will be placed in a vapor phase liquid nitrogen dry shipper immediately upon collection, and then transferred to a -80C freezer once back in the lab, until testing. Viral RNA will be extracted from bat fecal pellets/anal swabs. RNA will be aliquoted, and stored at -80C. PCR screening will be performed with pan-coronavirus (125, 126), filovirus (127) and paramyxovirus primers (128), in addition to virus specific primers where additional sensitivity is warranted in key viral reservoirs, i.e. Nipah virus or MERS virus specific primers (129, 130). PCR products will be gel purified and sequenced. We will attempt isolation on samples that contain viruses of interest (determined in Aim 1.5 below). using Vero cells and primary cell culture from the wildlife taxonomic order (bat, rodent and NHP cell lines). Over 70 bat cell lines are maintained at Duke-NUS from five different bat species. These include primary lung, brain, bone marrow, heart, kidney, intestine, liver, lymph node, muscle, spleen, PBMC and ovary/testes from Eonycteris spe/aea, Cynopterus bracyhotis, Rhinolophus Lepidus, Myotis muricola and Pteropus alecto bats. In addition we have 8 immortalized cell lines, including those derived from lungs, therefore suitable for the isolation of respiratory viruses. 1.4.d. Moving beyond RNA viruses: To detect pathogens from other families, such as non-RNA viruses, we will combine conserved PCR assays with NGS. We will perform either unbiased NGS, or use a pan-viral enrichment library to sequence full-length genomes ( 131). We will conduct this work via EID-CC research projects or as part of outbreak detection/investigation in the region from DNA viruses or other agents. 1.4.e. Sequencing Spike Glycoproteins: Based on earlier studies, our working hypothesis is that zoonotic Co Vs, FVs and henipaviruses encode receptor binding glycoproteins that elicit efficient infection of primary or continuous human cell lines (e.g., lung, liver, etc.) (16, 61, 62). Characterization these for SARSr-CoVs suggest that viruses up to 10%, but not 25%, different in the spike glycoprotein use human and bat ACE2 receptors for docking and entry. Uneven sampling gaps (e.g., no strains were found with 10-25% spike variation) prevent a thorough understanding of the transition point where the most divergent strains lose human ACE2 receptor usage. Our viral discovery curves (Fig. 6) suggest further sampling will reveal a rich diversity of as-yet-undiscovered SARSr-CoVs and strains of other viruses that fill in the phylogenetic tree between currently-described viruses. In this aim we will use phylogenetic and viral discovery analysis to specifically target bat species and regions that are under-sampled to allow sufficient power to identify and characterize missing strain diversity for potential zoonoses. We will sequence the S proteins of novel SARSr�CoVs to prioritize viruses for experimental work in Aim 3 to test this hypothesis. Likewise, we will test the hypothesis that phylogenetic related zoonotic receptor binding protein genes of ME RS-related, Ebola-related and NiV/HeV-related viruses will also program efficient entry via human and ortholog receptors. For all novel virus strains, we will sequence the complete entry spike genes by amplifying overlapping fragments using degenerate primers as shown previously (24, 61). Reverse Genetics: Full-length genomes of selected CoVs, FVs or henipaviruses (representative across subclades) will be sequenced using NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library 10 Page 286 Research StrategyContact PD/Pl: DASZAK, PETER Prep Kit for lllumina and sequenced on a MiSeq sequencer, PCR or Minion sequencing will be performed to fill gaps in the genome, The full length spike gene sequences, including the amount of variation in the receptor binding residues that bind the appropriate human receptor will be used to select strains for Aim 3 experiments. We will sequence full length genomes of high risk strains that are antigenically distinct and escape SARS or MERS-CoV cross neutralization, synthetically reconstruct a small subset (1-2) and evaluate growth in Vero, BHK and Huh? cells (63, 132). From full length sequences, synthetic clones will be ordered to recover recombinant viruses using reverse genetics as described by our groups ( 62, 63, 77, 109, 133, 134). Recombinant virus growth will be accessed in Vero, BHK, Huh? and select bat cells and recovered viruses used for downstream studies. Virus strain prioritization is described below. 1.5. Assessing risk for spillover. 1.5.a. Capacity to infect human cells: We will use a series of cell cultures to assess the capacity of target viruses to enter human cells. For Co Vs, FVs and henipaviruses, we will use primary human ciliated airway epithelial cells (HAE) and lung endothelial cell cultures derived from the lungs of de-identified transplant recipients. HAE are highly differentiated and grown on an air-liquid interface for several weeks prior to use (62, 63, 132). We will prepare HAE and lung endothelial cultures from three different patient codes in triplicate in collaboration with the tissue procurement facility at the Cystic Fibrosis Center at UNC. Cultures will be inoculated with chimeric bat SARSr-CoVs or novel FVs or henipaviruses to assess efficient replication. At 72 hpi, cultures will be fixed for immunofluorescent staining using antisera to the SARS-CoV conserved nucleocapsid protein (N) or to structural genes of the other viruses (64, 71). SARSr-CoVs that differ significantly in S protein sequence (11-24 % ) from epidemic SARS-CoV yet replicate in vitro, will also be evaluated for sensitivity to neutralization in Vero cells by PRNTS0 assays using broadly SARS-CoV cross reactive human mAbs S227.14, S230.15, S215.17, and S109.8 (63, 135) or monoclonal antibodies targeting the Ebola or Marburg E glycoprotein (Available through BEi), or NiV/HeV glycoproteins (136). As controls or if antisera is not available, the S genes of novel SARSr-CoV or spike entry genes of other novel viruses under investigation will be inserted into VEE 3526 replicon vectors (VRP3526-S), packaged and used to vaccinate mice ( 137). Polyclonal sera against test bat-SARS virus or other spike genes will be harvested and tested for ability to cross neutralize SARS-CoV, GD03, WIV-1, SHC014, WIV-16, other novel SARSr-CoV and HKU3- SRBD by PRNTS0 assay (63, 138, 139). Using PRNTS0 titers with sera (n=4 each) among these viruses, antigenic cartography (140) will allow comparison of antigenic vs. phylogenetic distance, identifying the transition at which SARSr-CoV strains escape SARS-CoV based vaccines, informing immunotherapeutic and vaccine design strategies (141-143). Similar approaches will be applied to novel MERS-related viruses, other CoV, FVs or henipaviruses. While most wildlife-origin viruses with unknown transmission potential or pathogenicity in people uncategorized, we use BSL-3 for isolation as standard, and cell culture for potentially BSL-4 pathogens will be undertaken at collaborating institute NEIDL. To facilitate this, duplicate samples in culture medium from animals PCR +ve for FVs and very close relatives of NiV or HeV will be shipped to NEIDL (See letter of support) for culture, characterization and sharing with other approved agencies including NIH Rocky Mountain Laboratories where Pl Daszak and Co-ls Barie have ongoing collaborations. Similarly, some duplicate samples of animals PCR +ve for CoVs will be shipped to UNC for further characterization by Co-I Barie. Where feasible and appropriate, training opportunities at NEIDL and UNC for in-country staff will be given, thereby enriching hands-on collaboration across sites. 1.5.b. Host ACE2, DPPR, Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) and EphrinB2/EphrinB3 receptors: We will sequence relevant host receptors for select mammalian wildlife species we find positive for strains of high-priority CoV clades, and all new henipaviruses and FVs. Of particular interest is homology across 18 bat and human orthologue ACE2 contact interface residues that engage the SARS RBD as a potential indicator of SARSr-CoV cross species transmission potential and growth in human cells (70). Likewise, variation in the NPC1 receptor has been shown to alter EBOV ability to infect in humans and bats, so this can be structurally mapped for prediction and downselection of strains (144). Signatures of positive selection in bat NPC1 were concentrated at the virus-receptor interface, with the strongest signal at the same residue that controls EBOV infection in Eidolon helvum cells. Thus NPC1 is a genetic determinant of FV susceptibility in bats, and some NPC1 variations likely reflect host adaptations to reduce FV replication and virulence (145). NiV and HeV use ephrin 82 or ephrin 83 as a receptor, and variation affects its ability to use human vs bat receptor molecules (103, 146). 11 Page 287 Research StrategyContact PD/Pl: DASZAK, PETER 1.5.c. Host-virus evolution and predicting receptor binding: We will use Bayesian and Maximum Likelihood phylogenetic analyses of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) sequences from PCR screening, receptor binding glycoproteins, and/or full genome sequence data (when available) to reconstruct the evolutionary history of the novel bat SARSr-CoVs, bat MERSr-CoV, FVs and henipaviruses that we identify. We will run co-phylogenetic analyses to map out instances of host-switching (147, 148) and ancestral state reconstruction analyses (Fig. 4) to identify the most important species for shaping evolutionary diversity for these viruses (51, 149), allowing for more targeted future surveillance and spillover mitigation interventions. For receptor binding glycoprotein sequence data from characterized viruses, we will apply codon usage analyses and codon adaptation indices, as used recently on henipaviruses ( 150), to assess the relative contributions of natural selection and mutation pressure in shaping host adaptation and host range. 1.5.d. Viral strain prioritization: Of the expected 100-200 novel SARSr-CoV strains, and approximately 600 total CoV strains, we will down-select to prioritize for further characterization based on S genes that are: i) different from SHC014, WIV1, SARS-CoV with diversity ranges of 10-25%; ii) have virus S RBD that could use human/bat receptors; iii) have recombinant chimeric spikes indicative of gene flow between clade I and II strains; iv) have bat ACE2 or DPP4 receptors that might select for spike RBDs that can use human receptors for entry ( 15/18 conserved residues in human/bat ACE2 molecules that bind SARSs-CoV S RBD domains are likely more efficient receptors than 3/18 conserved sites). Using structural models based on the SARS S glycoprotein, the extent and location of antigenic variation will be annotated onto the structure, further resolving the locations of highly evolving and conserved structural motifs/epitopes that function in protective immunity (135, 151-153). For novel henipaviruses, we will examine the receptor-binding proteins (e.g. envelope attachment (G) proteins) for sequence and structural homology with particular attention to conversation of amino acids that mediate ephrin receptor binding. We will prioritize strains that are predicted to interact with ephrin-B2 and expression V/W proteins to determine whether these viruses represent zoonotic threats. Using the recombinant Cedar virus (rCedV) platform, we will be able to rescue rCedV that express heterotypic G proteins to explore receptor utilization and tissue dissemination in animal models. We will assess ability to infect human cells using a continuous lung epithelial cell line, Calu3, which our group has previously used to generate data on NiV and HeV growth curves and a variety of host expression changes after infection (154). We will also use primary human airway cultures and microvascular endothelial cells to assess human infection for FVs, henipaviruses and MERSr- and SARSr-CoVs (155) (156). There is some evidence for NiV and HeV replication in mouse lung, low level titers in young animals, 10 fold higher titers in aged mice (157, 158). Thus it is likely these models could be improved in the collaborative cross mouse resource at UNC. We have identified CC lines that are highly vulnerable to wildtype SARS and others that develop hemorrhagic disease following mouse adapted Ebola infections (86-88). 1.5.e. Animal models: We will use transgenic mouse models and the UNC Collaborative Cross model to assess spillover potential of viruses. For work on Co Vs, we will follow the protocols in the transgenic mouse model used by the Barie lab previously. Briefly, in the BSL3 lab, 10- to 20-week old hACE2 or hDPP4 transgenic mice will be intranasally inoculated with 5 x 104 PFU of full length wildtype rbat CoV, or chimeric SARSr-CoV or MERSr-CoV encoding different bat CoV spike proteins respectively, then monitored daily for weight loss, morbidity, and clinical signs of disease. Mice will be euthanized at 2, 4, and 6 dpi (endpoint of 14 dpi), organs harvested and virus quantified by plaque assay or genome (mRNA 1) RT-PCR. After 7 days in formalin, tissues for histopathology will be removed from the BSL3 and stained with H&E, and for immunohistochemistry using polyclonal antibodies against the N protein. We will conduct limited evaluation of existing countermeasures using therapeutic monoclonal antibodies in vitro. Existing SARSr-CoV or MERS-CoV mAbs (159, 160) will be diluted in DMEM starting at 1 :20, and serial dilutions mixed with an equal volume of 50 PFU of chimeric bat SARSr-CoVs encoding different spike proteins and RFP indicator genes, then incubated on Vero E6 cells at 37°C for 1 h. Antibody neutralization titers will be evaluated by plaque quantification at 4- 5dpi. In select instances, hACE2 transgenic mice will be injected with SARS-CoV mAbs, and infected with chimeric bat SARSr-CoVs. Clinical signs and morbidity will be assessed and tissue pathology examined and compared with mice without treatment of mAbs to determine the therapeutic effect on SARSr-CoV infection, and protection of SARSr-CoV by wildtype SARS-S based vaccines assessed as described (132, 161). We will sequence full length genomes of high risk strains that are antigenically distinct and escape SARS or MERS�12 Page 288 Research StrategyContact PD/Pl: DASZAK, PETER CoV cross neutralization, synthetically reconstruct a small subset (1-2), recover full length viruses and evaluate the ability of nucleoside analogues to inhibit growth in HAE cultures and/or in vivo (63, 132). For the Collaborative Cross model, we will infect six to eight mice from 6-8 Collaborative Cross mouse lines (1 0 weeks of age) with six test viruses/yr, intransasally or by subcutaneous infection with 1 x 1 0e4 virus. Animals will be followed for weight loss, morbidity, mortality and other clinical disease symptoms (e.g., hunching, hindleg paralysis). One half the animals will be sacrificed at day 3 and day 7 pi. to evaluate virus growth in various organs, and organ pathology. In highly vulnerable lines, additional experiments will be performed using more animals, evaluating virus growth, clinical disease symptoms, respiratory pathology, tropism and organ pathology through day 28 pi. We anticipate that some CC lines will prove highly vulnerable to select wildtype viruses, because of host susceptibility combinations that promote severe disease outcomes. 1.6. Potential problems/alternative approaches: Challenges with logistics or obtaining permission for wildlife sampling in sites we select. We have a >20-year track record of successful field work in Malaysia, and >1 0 years in Thailand, and have strong established partnerships with local wildlife authorities and communities to ensure access. We have existing permissions in place which will be renewed at the start of this project. Due to the abundance of wildlife habitats in the region, if access to a site is withdrawn, we will rapidly identify a suitable, complementary site with similar bat species composition and abundance. Finally, we have already collected tens of thousands of wildlife samples from the region and will focus on these while waiting for permission. We may not identify novel viruses in our sample wildlife species due to seasonality of viral shedding or other factors. We have calculated sample sizes based on realistic detection rates from our extensive preliminary data, and are confident that we will detect and identify large numbers of potentially zoonotic pathogens, particularly for CoVs and PMVs. We acknowledge that FV strain diversity may be harder to capture, given relatively low seroprevalence in bat populations - suggesting lower levels of viral circulation (42, 43). However, our team was the first and only group to sequence FV RNA from Asian wildlife species (46, 47, 57), and we are confident that with our targeted sampling and testing strategy offers the best chance globally to identify additional strains of Ebola and related viruses. The sampling regions we have selected are subtropical, and our previous data, and even published studies in temperate regions (162), do not suggest a strong pattern of seasonality in CoV shedding, and where seasonal patterns do occur, i.e. for henipaviruses in Thailand (163), or can be predicted from wildlife serology data, we will be sure to conduct sampling at different timepoints throughout the year to account for this. Aim 2: Identify evidence and analyze risk factors for viral spillover in high-risk communities using novel serological assays. 2.1 Rationale/Innovation: Rapid response requires early detection. Assessing the spillover of rare or novel zoonotic agents will require targeted surveillance of high-risk communities that interface frequently with wildlife that harbor high risk emerging viral strains. To enhance the low statistical probability of identifying these rare events, In Aim 2 we will target rural human communities inhabiting regions identified in Aim 1 as having high viral diversity in wildlife, that also engage in practices that increase the risk of spillover (e.g. hunting and butchering wildlife). We will initially identify 4 subsites in each of Thailand, Peninsular Malaysia, Sarawak, and Sabah for sampling. We will design and deploy human risk factor questionnaires, and specific and sensitive serological assays to identify the baseline frequency, and causes of, spillover of known and related novel viral pathogens in these populations. We will use the results to test a key hypothesis: that hunting wildlife increases the risk of exposure to novel viruses, compared to the rest of the community. The alternative hypothesis is that seroprevalence in the general community is not statistically different to those who hunt and butcher wildlife, because exposure to wildlife pathogens is largely through inhabiting a biodiverse landscape where wildlife make indirect contact with people (e.g. via fomites). For participants who report symptoms related to 1) severe/acute respiratory illness (SARI/ARI); 2) Influenza-like illness (ILi); 3) fever of unknown origin (FUO); 4) encephalitis; 5) hemorrhagic fever; or 6) unusual presentation of high fever with severe diarrhea; all within the last 1 0 days, an additional sample type will be collected, two nasal or oropharyngeal swabs. Samples will be marked for additional PCR-based assays to identify presence of known and novel CoVs, henipaviruses and FVs, and for isolation and biological characterization of potential pathogens, using the approach laid out in Aim 1. 13 Page 289 Research StrategyContact PD/Pl: DASZAK, PETER 2.2 Preliminary data on high-zoonotic risk human community surveillance: 2.2.a Biological sample collection in SE Asia: Our long-term collaboration in the region has included qualitative and quantitative survey data, and collecting large archives of banked human sera and other biological samples from high zoonotic-risk populations. For example, under the USAID-PREDICT project, EHA has collected 1,400 and 678 specimens in Malaysia and Thailand respectively from people living in zoonotic disease interfaces, all of which will be available for retrospective serological testing by EID-SEARCH which we have ensured is compliant with our existing IRB. Our core group has collected and tested many thousand additional specimens from other important community cohorts (Table 2), and some of these will continue under EID-SEARCH (Section 2.4).

We conducted exploratory studies using standardized one-on-one semi-structured interviews and site observation data with people living in hotspot areas or engaged in high-zoonotic spillover risk activities, using these data to assess local social and cultural norms underlying wildlife contact ( 165). We then developed a risk factor survey to accompany human biological sampling to evaluate the type and frequency of animal contact, wildlife exposure in daily life, occupational risk in markets and long the wildlife value chain, and unusual illnesses reported over the past 12 months. We conducted cross-sectional studies in high risk populations in 27 countries, and study participants provided biological samples (oral/oropharyngeal swab, nasal/nasopharyngeal swab, urine sample/urogenital swab, fecal sample/rectal swab, whole blood, serum, plasma). For example, survey and biological samples were collected from: 1,585 participants from 7 sites in Yunnan, Guangxi, and Guangdong provinces, China; 1,400 participants from 4 sites in Malaysia; and 678 participants from 4 sites in Thailand. Samples were tested with novel serological assays and results analyzed against risk factors from survey data (16). In China, CoV-seropositive individuals were mostly farmers/peasants (8/9), living in Yunnan province (7/9), 41-60 yrs old (7/9), with domestic contact with rodents (6/9), that are male (6/9). Although these results are preliminary and don't provide detailed information on routes of exposure, they identify key subpopulations to target that would likely increase the opportunity for identifying evidence of spillover for other CoVs, PMVs and FVs. Data from PREDICT surveys have been used to help identify target populations in Aim 2, identify strategies to better target at-risk people, and conduct focused human risk factor surveys and serosurveys to produce statistically significant findings for henipaviruses, CoVs and FVs. In Aim 2, we will use combined biological sampling and risk factor surveillance in targeted populations within the community to 1) test the hypothesis that occupational (i.e. wildlife hunting) risk factors correlate with seropositivity to henipaviruses, FVs and CoVs; 2) assess possible health effects of infection in people; and 3) where recent 14 Page 290 Research StrategyContact PD/Pl: DASZAK, PETER illness is reported, obtain biological samples for PCR testing and potential viral isolation and characterization. Obtaining this information could be a significant step in understanding the likelihood of recent 'hidden' spillover events and their public health impacts, as well as the risk of future emergence of viral disease. 2.2.c. Risk factors for illness: Our preliminary data in Thailand, Malaysia and other SE Asian countries revealed that frequent contact with wild (e.g. bats, rodents, NHPs) and domestic animals (e.g. poultry, swine) among local communities was associated with a high percentage of self-reported severe/acute respiratory illness (SARI/ARI) and Influenza-like illness (ILi) symptoms (Section 3.2.b). In addition, people involved in crop production, hunting and butchering of wildlife reported statistically significantly higher SARI and ILi symptoms (Li et al., in prep.). These preliminary data suggest a target population and sites for current proposal with the correct targets for serological surveillance and risk factor surveys in Aim 2 to produce statistically significant findings. Coupled with better serological tools from our team (Section 2.2.d), we will be able to identify the likely routes of exposure to known or novel coronaviruses, henipaviruses, and FVs in the study region, as well as build data on the illnesses they cause in people. 2.2.d. Serological platform development: Most emerging viruses produced a short-lived viremia in people so that large samples sizes are required to provide enough PCR-positive individuals to analyze infection patterns. For Aim 2, we will focus on serological sampling in the community, because antibodies are typically long-lived and can be used to assess prior virus exposure or infection with much smaller samples sizes ( 123). Most serological assays target a single protein, and for emerging viruses, it's often unclear which viral antigen will be immunodominant during human infection, and therefore which to target in developing serological assays. Co-ls Wang. Anderson (Duke-NUS) and Broder. Laing (USUS) have developed a series of approaches to deal with this problem. and which will be used in testing human biological samples in Aims 2 and 3. Henipaviruses, FV and Co Vs express envelope receptor-binding proteins that are the target of protective antibody responses. Co-I Broder has led efforts to express and purify henipavirus native-like virus surface proteins for immunoassay application (166, 167), developing monoclonal antibodies (168, 169) and as subunit vaccines (170, 171), has developed a novel, multiplex microsphere immunoassay (MMIA) allowing serum samples to be simultaneously tested for antibodies reactive with henipaviruses, FVs and CoVs. This MMIA uses a Luminex-based multiplex platform and custom designed virus receptor-binding proteins expressed in a mammalian cell-culture system and purified as native-like oligomeric proteins. These oligomeric antigens retain post-translational modifications and quaternary structures, allowing capture of conformational�dependent antibodies raised during a natural infection, which represent the majority of the protective humeral response. The known diversity of henipaviruses includes five presently described viruses, NiV, HeV, CedV, GhV and MojV and this assay has been expanded to include all described species (Fig. 11 ). In the past, our collaborators have used NiV and HeV G protein antigens in a MMIA assay to identify a serological footprint of NiV-related African henipaviruses and exposure to virus(es) antigenically-related to NiV in livestock sampled in Bangladesh (78, 79).

Co-ls Hughes, Broder, Laing have conducted initial screening of human, wildlife and livestock samples at high-risk interfaces in Malaysia, finding serological evidence of past exposure to viruses antigenically-related to NiV and EBOV in humans, bats and non-human primates (NHPs). Fig. 11: Validation of multiplex microsphere immunoassay (MMIA) specificity and identification of immunologically cross-reactive viruses for A) NiV B) EBOV. 15 Page 291 Research StrategyContact PD/Pl: DASZAK, PETER Co-ls Wang and Anderson (Duke-NUS) have developed a phage-display method to screen antibodies for all known and related bat-borne viruses, including henipaviruses, FVs and CoVs and have set up a similar Luminex-based assay. Additionally the Duke-NUS team has demonstrated capacity for rapid and cost-effective development of LIPS serological assays against novel viral agents (Sections 2.6.a, 3.2.a). These will be used for verification and expanded surveillance. For molecular investigation (Aim 2 & 3), we will combine targeted PCR with a discovery-driven enrichment NGS strategy to not only survey currently known viruses, but also to discover potential novel viruses. Both the phage-display serological and enrichment platforms can be rapidly updated to include new viruses identified. 2.3 General Approach/Innovation: Our human sampling approach uses two approaches in Aims 1 & 2 (Fig. 12). In Aim 2 we will conduct community-based surveillance using a brief, focused questionnaire to )I Alm 2 High-Risk Communltiee Q Sito Selection • high z:oonotic-risk 'ilirusH Identified In .an melt • human-animal interaction • adjacent to wl1dllft umpllng lites In Alm 1 Target Population • community realdent1 • ~12yHl'I0ICI • high expo1ure lo animals Consent an.d Enrollment Q Data Collection I • whole blood for serology • risk factor survey ,r SARVARI, Ill; FUO, enoephal,t,s; hemofrhlfg)o f6VO,: t/ilUSuhl fng/1 ta.wfflldlarrltea ropotto<J witllHJ rm, la.sl JOdttys • nasal/oropharyngeal twaba Q DataAnalysls I • 11rologlc11 dlagno11lcs • PCR diagnosllcs • risk f1c:1or 1naly1l1 • epldemlologlc.al analysts Alm 3 Clinic Syndromic Patients )I Sile Selection Q •clinic.sand h01pltat1 &ervlng I commI,mlllt1 a1 sites fOf Alm 2 Target Population 0 "lnpatlont1 • it 12 ye,,s and old outpatients I • presenting with SARl!ARI; Ill; FUO; ancophalltlt; hemorrt,a,g le fa-wor: unusual high fe-,.,erJuvere diarrhea Consent and Enrollment Q Data Collection • nasallo,opharyngeat IwabI • rlak fact0< aurvey • clinical hlItory Data Analysis • PCR dlagno11lc1 • rt k faclof 1matyI1a • opklem~l~leal 1n1ty1l1 d po.sltw9 PCR reslllts • virus charac-terlzallon Follow-Up within 35 Days • whole blood tor sorology • nrologlcal dl1,gno1tics identify the prevalence and frequency of risk-factors for viral spillover in tandem with collection of high quality biological samples to determine the seroprevalence of spillover viruses in at-risk human populations. We will use generalized linear models to analyze correlation between biological results and risk-factors for viral spillover. In Aim 3, we will conduct clinic-based syndromic surveillance and biological sampling at clinics/hospitals that are the catchment healthcare facilities for the communities sampled in Aim 2. Both community-based and clinic-based syndromic surveillance programs are cross sectional case-control studies designed with the sample sizes necessary to statistically quantify (with a power of 80%) risk factors and health impacts for viral spillover, linked to serological status and PCR prevalence in symptomatic patients. All human sampling conducted under Aims 2 and 3 will adhere to strict criteria for inclusion and recruitment and protection of human subjects from research risk (see Human Subjects and Clinical Trials Information). Fig. 12: Human sampling approach. Aim 2 (left) focuses on serology in high-risk communities to identify evidence of population exposure to novel zoonotic viruses. Aim 3 (right) sets up clinical cohorts at hospitals serving these high-risk communities to conduct syndromic surveillance and identify the etiology of new viral syndromes 2.4 Target population & sample sizes: We will target populations in the same geographic regions as those identified in Aim 1 that harbor wildlife with high potential zoonotic viral diversity, that are EID hotspots, and that are well-connected through regional travel and trade hubs to the global travel network (Fig 13). Within each geographic region we will identify populations at four sub-sites, building on our preliminary data (Table 2). We will target specific communities based on our analysis of previously collected behavioral questionnaire data, and other publicly available data (e.g. wildlife hunting licenses sold in a region, number of guano caves accessed for fertilizer etc.) to identify key at-risk populations and occupations with high exposure to wildlife. We will conduct concurrent sampling trips at visits to sub-sites during which members of the community will be enrolled and wildlife surveillance activities conducted. Individuals living or working around wildlife habitats (e.g. bat caves/roosts), who hunt wildlife, work with wildlife or livestock, or slaughtering wildlife will be considered for enrollment. Participants will complete a consent form and questionnaire in addition to having biological samples collected. During these community trips after data collection the field research staff will conduct community meetings to help inform the public health risk of zoonoses. Target populations: Thailand (Co-/ Wacharapluesadee): 100 subjects of healthy high-risk community from 2 study sites, Chonburi (NiV, other PMVs and CoVs found by PCR in bats in our previous work), and Ratchaburi (bat guano harvester villages where we found a MERSr-CoV in bat guano (50, 175) and serological evidence of a-CoVs, HKU1-CoV in people ( 175). Peninsular Malaysia (Co-I Hughes, CM Ltd.): We will expand our sampling of the Orang Asli indigenous communities to include sub-sites in communities in Districts we have already sampled and 16 Page 292 Research StrategyContact PD/Pl: DASZAK, PETER additional Districts in the States of Kelantan Perak, Pahang, and Kelantan all close to bat caves.

Sabah: We will conduct sampling at the Madai bat and bird cave that has 200 permanent residents who harvest bird's nests for soup, and >1,000 during the harvesting season and at Gomantong cave - one of the largest bat and cave swiftlet nesting sites in the world.

Protocols follow those for Peninsular Malaysia Singapore: {Co-I Wang, Duke-NUS): Active human surveillance will be not be conducted in Singapore, but archived human specimens e.g. from our Melaka virus serosurvey (8), will be made available to conduct retrospective serosurveys for specific pathogens that are identified as high interest to the EIDRC, NIH, and EID-CC. ...... ..... ........ ;. Fig. 13: Targeting high-risk sites for human zoonotic disease surveillance in Thailand and Malaysia. This map plots areas with high numbers of expected viruses in wildlife (3), greater spillover probability based on EID risk factors (2), and higher levels of connectivity (measured by road density data) that may facilitate person-person spread . .__ Sample sizes: From our previous work we conservatively anticipate that 10- 30% of the community population will have had exposure to wildlife allowing us to capture highly exposed and non-exposure individuals at each site. Individuals living or working around wildlife habitats (e.g. bat caves/roosts), who hunt wildlife, work with wildlife or livestock farming, transportation, selling, or slaughtering wildlife in the surveyed areas will be targeted so that they make up 230% of the sampled population in each community. We will stratify sampling to ensure appropriate representation of sex, demographic, and socio-economic factors at each community site. In each of our regions, we will conduct sampling at four sub-sites in populations with high prevalence of high occupational and environmental risk of exposure to wildlife populations, sampling 175 persons at each sub-site. We will target populations with, on average, 30% or higher prevalence of occupational or environmental exposures to wildlife based on data from previous studies. This design will give us >80% power to detect 5 percentage point differences in seroprevalence against any of our viral groups between baseline and high-risk subgroups. We conservatively assume 5% base seroprevalence, as well as assuming high spatio-temporal variance amongst sub-sites, with baseline varying 0-25% amongst sub-sties and the fraction of the population at risk varying from 20-40%. (Power calculation conducted by 500 simulations of a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM)). For community-based surveillance, we will enroll 700 individuals per study region, allowing us to make county/province-level comparisons of differing effects; the total sample will be 3,500 participants over 5 years. 2.5 Data & sample collection: Following enrollment, biological specimens (5ml will be drawn for whole blood and serum collection, samples will be aliquoted, at least one max 500 µL of whole blood and two 500 µL serum samples) will be collected by locally certified healthcare professional proficient in phlebotomy techniques and a short questionnaire will be administered by trained project staff that speak appropriate local language to all participants. Through the serological findings and the survey we will investigate the details of five risk factors related to high risk wildlife exposure, to maximize the power of the analyses, based on continuing analysis of our previous work, and will focus on: 1) occupation and occupational exposures; 2) observed or reported interactions with priority wildlife, especially bats, in/around house; 3) proximity of residence or work place to environments of increased risks, e.g. nearby bat roosts; 4) working or regular visitor to animal markets; 5) self�reported ILi/SARi clinical diagnosis or symptoms in the past 12mo and lifetime. For participants who report the symptoms relating to 1) severe/acute respiratory illness (SARI/ARI); 2) Influenza-like illness (ILi); 3) fever of unknown origin (FUO); 4) encephalitis; or 5) hemorrhagic fever within the last 10 days, an additional sample type will be collected, nasal or oropharyngeal swab (2x). Blood of participants whose serum tests positive for emerging viral pathogens will be taken and Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) frozen for future use. 17 Page 293 Research StrategyContact PD/Pl: DASZAK, PETER These will be used for future harvesting of polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies as potential therapeutics/ diagnostics (see Letter of Support NEIDL). 2.6: Laboratory analysis: 2.6.a Serological testing: We will screen all human specimens for henipaviruses, FVs and CoVs using our novel, multiplex microsphere immunoassay (MMIA) (Section 2.2.d). We will use ELISA and serum neutralization tests (SNT) as confirmatory, where feasible and appropriate for the biocontainment level given sensitivity and specificity variation, and the need for live virus for SNTs (See Select Agent Research). Serologic evidence of local spillover will be used to prioritize zoonotic strains for recombinant virus recovery from full length sequences. Preliminary data suggest ELISA will be effective for some viral groups. We previously developed a SARSr-CoV specific ELISA for serosurveillance using the purified NP of a bat SARSr-CoV (Rp3). The specificity of this assay was evaluated using polyclonal antibodies against HKU1, OC43, 229E, NL63, MERS-CoV and EBOV and no significant cross-activity detected ( 16). This suggests that if we can expand our NP serology tests to cover other bat CoVs, and that doing so may identify many more seropositive individuals. For CoVs, we will therefore use two serological testing approaches: 1) testing human sera collected from both community- and clinic- based sampling for a panel of bat CoVs that will include SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, SADS-CoV and a range of bat SARSr-CoVs (16); 2) testing for antibodies to common human CoVs (HCoV NL63, OC43 - Section 2.8). We will test panels of NP and G recombinant proteins to assess if this approach will act as a comparison to MMIA for FVs and PMVs. 2.6.b RT-PCR testing. Specimens from individuals in the community who reported being symptomatic within the last 10 days (Section 2.5) will be screened using RT-PCR initially for CoVs, PMVs, and FVs following published protocols (Section 1.4.c). Positive samples will be subjected to full genome sequencing and RT�PCR amplification of the glycoprotein genes. Samples from the clinic-based syndromic surveillance will also be tested using RT-PCR for Influenza A & B, HCoV NL63, OC43, HKU1, SARS-CoV & 229E, NiV, HeV, Ebola (WHO PCR protocol) based on the symptom as rule-outs. 2.6.c Biological characterization of viruses identified: Novel viruses identified in humans will be recovered by cultivation or viruses re-derived from full length genome sequences using reverse genetic approaches. Viruses will be characterized for growth in primary human cell lines and in mouse models, including the Collaborative Cross Mice or humanized mice expressing human receptors from related strains. The approaches are discussed in more detail under Aim 1. 2.7 Epidemiological analysis: We will conduct a cross sectional case-control study to identify risk factors for Henipavirus, FVs, and CoVs spillover. "Cases" are defined as participants whose samples tested positive for Henipavirus, FVs, or CoVs by serological tests. "Controls" will be selected from the pool of participants admitted to the studies and whose samples tested negative for Henipavirus, FVs, or CoVs. We will use nearest neighbor matching to pair cases demographically (e.g. age, sex, location) with controls at a 1-to-3 ratio or greater. We will use generalized linear models and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analyses ( 176) to analyze correlation between biological results, serological/PCR status, and risk factors related to high risk wildlife exposure including: 1) occupation and occupational exposures; 2) observed or reported interactions with priority wildlife, especially bats, in/around house; 3) home or work proximity to environments of increased risks, e.g. nearby bat roosts; 4) working or regular visitor to animal markets; 5) self�reported ILi/SARi clinical diagnosis or symptoms lifetime and past 12mo. Additionally, we will use this procedure to determine how clinical presentation differs between Henipavirus, FVs, or CoVs in exposed and unexposed participants, as well as in the time course of illness, severity of symptoms, and type of symptoms. 2.8 Potential problems/alternative approaches: Rarity of spillover events means it may be difficult to identify sufficient seropositives to statistically analyze human risk profiles. First, we will be targeting our community-based surveillance to subpopulations with high-levels of wildlife exposure, at sites selected for diverse and prevalent viruses to increase likelihood of finding positive individuals. Second, our serology testing will include a multi-plex panel of assays for a large diversity of viruses, increasing likelihood of positives. For example, in previous work our overall bat CoV PCR prevalence in the community was, 11.8%; 13-CoV, 3.4%; a�CoV, 9.1 %). Thus, using this broad serological panel to screen individuals prone to contact with species of higher zoonotic risk increases the potential for detecting spillover with enough power for statistical analyses, 18 Page 294 Research StrategyContact PD/Pl: DASZAK, PETER and will shed light on behaviors that predispose to spillover, Third, we will include common human CoVs, PMVs, and influenza viruses in our panel, so that even if low prevalence of wildlife viruses is found, we will be able to conduct a valuable cross-sectional study of the seroprevalence of more common human viruses. Finally, we will be able to assess relative measures of human-wildlife contact from our survey work. We will analyze intensity of contact with high-risk taxa against other risk factors to provide useful proxy information for spillover risk. Serological testing may be difficult to interpret in the presence of known and novel viruses. We will use the three-tiered serological testing system outline in 2.6.a to try to identify exposure to these 'novel' viruses. However, we know exposure to a range of related viruses generates antisera that are cross-reactive with known, related virus antigens - a serious challenge to serological surveillance and diagnostics. Our collaborations have already demonstrated that SE Asia bat sera samples screened with our pan-filovirus MMIA have been exposed to an Ebola-like virus, that is antigenically-distinct from known Asiatic filoviruses, Reston virus and Mengla virus (43). Using these three serological platforms we will address inherent challenges of indirect virus surveillance through antibody capture by testing multiple binding assay platforms and antigens, using positive control samples to establish serological profiles against known viruses that will aid in our interpretations of cross-reactive antisera responses likely representative of 'novel' viruses. Aim 3: Identify and characterize viral etiology of 'cryptic' outbreaks in clinical cohorts. 3.1 Rationale/Innovation: Our previous research (Table 1) and other data suggests that there are substantial numbers of outbreaks or clinical cases for which the etiologic agent is not diagnosed, e.g. (177, 178). To investigate this in SE. Asia, we have assembled a multi-disciplinary team that includes senior infectious disease doctors and clinicians and will work directly with local clinics and regional hospitals to identify the 'cryptic' outbreaks or cases that occur in the region. In Aim 2, we will conduct serology in high zoonotic�risk communities to find evidence of prior exposure in people, i.e. evidence of viral spillover into the community. In Aim 3 we identify members of these communities presenting at clinic with undiagnosed illness that may have high-impact zoonotic viral etiology. Therefore, in Aim 3 we focus on PCR to identify the putative viruses that are replicating in these actively-infected patients (Fig. 12). We will enroll, and collect high quality biological samples from patients who live in rural communities linked to Aim 2 and who present at regional clinics or hospitals with symptoms typical of high impact zoonotic viruses. We will collect detailed survey data to assess their contact type and frequency with wildlife and livestock and conduct molecular and serological diagnostic assays to test causal links between their syndromes and the known and novel viral agents identified in Aim 1. We will conduct molecular viral discovery assays on patients who present with symptoms indicative of a high-risk zoonotic virus. If novel pathogens are identified by PCR, we will attempt to isolate, obtain full genome sequence and/or biologically characterize the wildtype or molecularly re-derived pathogen, using the in vitro and in vivo strategy laid out in Aim 1. 3.2 Preliminary data clinical surveillance: 3.2.a. Clinical surveys and outbreak investigations: Our longterm collaboration in the region has included the following activities investigating clinical syndromes: Peninsular Malaysia: At the time of writing, an outbreak of suspected undiagnosed viral illness in the indigenous Batek Orang Asli ("people of the forest") community living at Gua Musang ("civet cat cave") district, in Kelantan, Malaysia, close to Taman Negara - a National Park containing the oldest known rainforest. This community is one where we have conducted prior routine surveillance and biological sampling, demonstrating proof-of-concept that our two-pronged high-risk community/clinic approach will work. Dozens of people are affected and the outbreak is currently being investigated by our group in collaboration with the Malaysian NPHL. The Orang Asli continue to practice traditional subsistence hunting of wild animals (bats, rodents, primates). These communities are remotely located, in heavily forested areas, with limited access to medical services. This outbreak, and others that will continue to emerge just like it underscore the critical need for our EIDRC - to improve the technological tools, training, and human capacity for rapid EID surveillance, diagnosis, and response at the frontlines of disease emergence in SE Asia. Investigating this outbreak is a key priority if EID-SEARCH is funded. Sabah: Co-I Kamruddin (BMHRC) is leading an asymptomatic leptospirosis study on sanitation workers, an ILi study in a Kota Kinabalu clinic and diarrheal study in children under 5 yrs. Co-ls William, Tan and others have conducted clinical observational studies to determine the etiology of central nervous system infections and acute undifferentiated febrile illness in Sabah. 19 Page 295 Research StrategyContact PD/Pl: DASZAK, PETER Co-ls William and consultant Yeo have collaborated with Co-I Wang to enroll 90 adult and over 100 pediatric participants with central nervous system infections, negative tests for malaria and dengue from 3 district hospitals in Sabah to determine the various etiologies. While a proportion tested positive for rickettsial agents, the majority had no clear diagnosis. Co-ls William, Rajah ram, and Yeo have conducted clinical studies of over 200 inpatients with acute febrile illness with negative tests for malaria and dengue from 3 district hospitals in Sabah to determine the various etiologies. While a high proportion tested positive for rickettsial agents, the majority had no clear diagnosis. Sarawak: Co-I Siang (UNI MAS) is conducting a survey of high-risk female Kelabit indigenous people and has found 8% with HPV52 as the dominant strain. He is working on clinical cohorts of hand, foot and mouth disease and will recruit patients from that study in the current proposed work. Finally, Co-ls Siang, Kamruddin are conducting a long-term study of rotavirus and other viral etiologies of acute gastroenteritis in Kuching, Sarawak that will include swine herders and farmers. The Barie lab is a global leader in norovirus VLP diagnostic reagents to detect serologic evidence of norovirus gastroenteritis, as well as RT-PCR detection of novel noroviruses in humans, and has identified novel bat noroviruses, suggesting further opportunities for expansion of this work ( 142, 179-181 ). This work is particularly relevant in Malaysia because pig farms are shunned by the government and local villagers to they are placed far away from town centers, deep in the forest, and it is this scenario that led to the emergence of Nipah virus in 1998-9 (6, 22). Thailand: Co-ls Hemachudha, Wacharapluesedee (TRC-EID, Chulalongkorn Univ. Hosp.) work in coordination with the Thailand Ministry of Health to investigate outbreak etiology, including the first case of imported MERS-CoV in Thailand, for which we produced sequence confirmation within 24 hours from acquiring the specimen. Three imported MERS cases have been detected in Thailand since 2015, and all cases were confirmed at the TRC-EID. We worked during the Zika outbreak to identify> 500 PCR-positive Zika patients with sequence confirmation. We have also worked on returning and suspected Ebola travelers, syndromic surveillance for SARI, encephalitis, Hand Foot and Mouth disease in children and viral diarrhea. Consultant Hickey (US CDC, Thailand), screened specimens collected between 1998 and 2002 from a large cohort of children from Kamphaeng Phet Province to examine Dengue virus and JE epidemiology (182, 183). Among the 784/2,574 convalescent sera henipavirus-specific antibodies were detected in 13 serum samples (1.7% seroprevalence ), suggesting prior exposure to endemic henipaviruses or a related PMV in rural Thailand. Singapore: Duke-NUS has worked with the Ministry of Health to investigate Zika cases (184), and other EIDs. With EHA and others, Duke-NUS has developed novel CoV assays for clinical surveillance, and for expedited analysis during outbreaks. Our pipeline of novel virus detection, reservoir host identification, serological assay development, and serological testing is as rapid as several months, with the development of novel serological assays from sequence data in 7 days (17). For example, with the discovery of SADS-CoV, we identified and fully sequenced a new virus, screened archived wildlife specimens to identify the natural reservoir host species (Rhinolophus spp. bats), developed LIPS serological assays, and tested human and swine samples to assess seroprevelance in less than 3 months (17). 3.2.b Analysis of self-reported illness: We have developed a standardized approach for analyzing data from study participants on self-reported symptoms related to target illnesses: fever with cough and shortness of breath or difficulty breathing (severe acute respiratory illness - SARI); fever with muscle aches (fevers of unknown origin (FUO); and, cough or sore throat (influenza-like illness - ILi). For all of our prior human clinical surveillance in 20+ countries, including in Malaysia and Thailand, we used a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression to identify associations between participants who reported ILi and/or 1,1ii.n,....orww,wOQOUdawrwates I•• o 74 n • 17) .i~~poute~&lano>of••078n•56) 0 p.lc.1$ (1 •004 n • 183) 0 lnhocaebe!t.

Results have clear biological relevance. For example, in Yunnan, China, factors strongly associated with prior disease involve animal hunting and consumption (Fig. 14). We will expand this approach for all clinical syndromes in Aim 3, and use targeted questions to t U 2 assess patient's exposure to wildlife in terms that are relevant to each specific country.

Orange circles= odds ratios> 1 (+ve association); purple= odds ratios <1 (-ve association). 20 Page 296 Research StrategyContact PD/Pl: DASZAK, PETER 3.3 General Approach: Our previous research suggests that there are substantial numbers of outbreak cases for which the etiologic agent has not been identified. To capture these, we will expand on our current syndromic surveillance to enroll, and collect high quality biological samples from patients who present at regional clinics and live in rural communities linked to Aim 2. Case definitions and enrollment criteria include: 1) severe/acute respiratory illness (SARI/ARI); 2) Influenza-like illness (ILi); 3) fever of unknown origin (FUO); 4) encephalitis; 5) hemorrhagic fever; or 6) high fever/diarrhea with unusual presentation. We will collect survey data to assess contact with wildlife, and occupational and environmental exposures, conduct molecular and serological assays to test causal links between their syndromes and the known and novel viral agents identified in Aim 1. If novel pathogens are identified by PCR, we will attempt to isolate and biologically characterize the pathogen, using the collaborative cross to identify an appropriate animal model to conduct preliminary pathogenesis work. We will then use behavioral survey data, ecological and phylogeographic analyses to assess the likely reservoir hosts to inform intervention programs. 3.4 Clinical cohorts. 3.4.a Cohort selection: We will initiate active clinic-based syndromic surveillance at 2 town-level level clinics and 2 provincial-level hospitals in each Thailand, Peninsular Malaysia, Sabah and Sarawak. These serve as the catchment healthcare facilities for people in our community-based surveillance of Aim 2 and are inclusive of wildlife sampling sites in Aim 1. Patients 2::: 12 years old presenting at the health facility who meet the syndromic and clinical case definitions above will be recruited into the study after completing a consent form. We will aim to enroll 300 participants per hospital, with that we will have a 95% probability of detecting live virus in patients in each hospital assuming a population prevalence of 1 %. This sampling effort will total of 4,800 individuals for clinical syndromic surveillance. We assume up to 40% loss from follow-up, therefore yielding 2880 participants that will be available for follow-up blood sampling (Section 3.4.b). While enrollment is limited by the number of patients that come to the healthcare facility presenting with relevant clinical symptoms, in our work in the PREDICT project we enrolled an average of 100 participants per year, so we are confident this is an achievable enrollment target. Study data will be pooled across country regions, as clinical patients are limited by the number of individuals presenting at hospitals. "Cases" will be determined as participants whose samples tested positive for either CoVs, henipavirus, or FVs, PCR tests. "Controls" will be selected from the pool of participants admitted to the studies and whose samples tested negative. We will use nearest neighbor matching to pair cases demographically (e.g. age, sex, location) with controls at a 1-to-3 ratio or greater. Sites: Thailand: We will work with two primary hospital, Phanat Nikhom Hosp., Chonburi district (Key Pers. Dr. P. Hemachudha) & Photharam Hosp., Ratchaburi Province, and a large tertiary hospital, King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Bangkok Thailand (Co-I Dr. T. Hemachudha). Peninsular Malaysia: Focusing immediately on the current outbreak in Orang Asli, we will work closely with the Malaysian Ministry of Health to support their investigation, and with 6 Orang Asli clinics which focus solely on this indigenous community. Co-I Sellaran (Lintang Clinic, Kuala Kangsar) refers patients to Sungai Siput Hospital and Gen. Hospital, lpoh. Key Pers. I Lotfi (Pos Betau clinic, Kuala Lipis) will continue collaboration with Co-I Hughes in the communities at that site. Sarawak: Key Pers. Diyana (Director, Bario Clinic) refers patients to Miri Hospital (Co-I Utap) and serves people from the Kelabit, and nomadic tribes in the region, as well as populations within a number of large towns. Sabah: We will continue our collaboration with Queen Elizabeth Hospital, QEH (Key Pers. Lee, Rajahram) and Hospital University Malaysia Sabah, HUMS (Co-I Lasimbang, Director). Both clinics include our targeted sites for Aim 2 in their catchment, and both have ongoing collaboration with the Borneo Medical Health Ctr (Co-I Kamruddin, Director). Singapore: Currently, there are no plans to conduct clinic surveillance based on budget constraints. However, in the event that that is an evolving need for clinic surveillance, enrollment, and sampling, we have close working relationships with all hospitals in the country, and the central infectious disease reference lab (key clinicians at which are aware of our proposal). This would allow us to rapidly on-board a hospital based site. 3.4.b Clinic enrollment and follow-up: We will recruit inpatients and outpatients to participate in the study after initial screening to determine if they meet our clinical case definitions. Once consented and enrolled, biological samples will be collected by trained and locally certified hospital staff and a questionnaire administered by trained hospital or research staff that speak appropriate local language. Every effort will be made to take samples concurrently when collecting samples for normative diagnostics. For both inpatients and outpatients, samples will be collected no more than 10 days of reported onset of illness to increase the chance 21 Page 297 Research StrategyContact PD/Pl: DASZAK, PETER of PCR detection of viruses ( 185). Where possible, we will follow up 35 days after enrollment to collect an additional two 500 µL serum samples conduct a standardized questionnaire supplement to collect additional data on the course of symptoms in the interim period. This gives adequate time for development of lgG, which occurs <28 days after onset of symptoms for SARS patients ( 186-188). Serum samples will be used to screen panels of high risk human and local zoonotic Filovirus, Henipavirus and Coronavirus strains as described in Aim 2. These samples may prove valuable to collaborators in that the PBMC could be used in production of therapeutic antibodies. 3.4.c Sampling and clinical interview: Biological specimens whole blood (5ml will be drawn for whole blood and serum collection, samples will be aliquoted, at least one max. 500 µL whole blood; two 500 µL serum samples) and two nasal or oropharyngeal swabs will be collected from all participants, and a questionnaire will be administered. We will investigate five risk factors, to maximize the power of the analyses, all related to high risk wildlife exposure, based on continuing analysis of our previous work, and will include: 11) occupation and occupational exposures; 2) observed or reported interactions with priority wildlife, especially bats, in/around house; 3) proximity of residence or work place to environments of increased risks, e.g. nearby bat roosts; 4) working or regular visitor to animal markets; 5) self-reported ILi/SARi clinical diagnosis or symptoms in the past 12mo and lifetime. With additional consent considerations for participants enrolled from clinical settings, we will review clinical records to collect data on medical history, clinical syndromes, and patient etiology. Blood will be taken for future harvesting of Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs), as per Section 2.5. 3.5 Sample testing: The standard syndromic diagnostic PCR assays for common pathogens will be conducted and the results will be shared with the hospital with 48 hours. Specimens will be further tested for 3 viral families; CoV, PMV and filovirus by consensus PCR (Section 1.4.c). Necropsy samples from deceased patients will be further characterized by NGS if previous PCRs are negative and unable to identify the cause of infection. Co-ls Wang, Anderson will conduct a VirScan serological assay using paired serum samples at Duke-NUS that identifies antibodies with a four-fold rise in titer in the convalescent sample compared with the acute sample, thereby indicating a possible etiological agent. A PCR test with the specific primer from each virus antibody positive case will be further tested from acute specimens to confirm infection. 3.6 Viral risk characterization and potential for pandemic spread: We will use statistical models built from collated biological, ecological, and genetic data to assess the likelihood of pathogenicity for the range of diverse viruses we will characterize. The aim is to quickly identify and assess which viruses pose the most significant risk to human health and thus prioritize additional resources to more fully characterize, better understand oathogenicity, and invest in our animal model pipeline and ultimately therapeutic development for those pathogens. We will combine two independent but related statistical models to predict pathogen spillover risk and pathogenicity. First, we will expand a simple generalized additive modeling approach (3) to assess spillover risk probability to a new virus that is currently not known to infect people, when we have only limited genetic data from initial PCR screening and sequencing. Additional data from receptor binding protein homology and cell line infection experiments will be incorporated into the model framework as available. Second, given high likelihood to spillover and infect humans, or direct evidence of human infection from our clinical surveillance, we will then assess the likelihood of pathogenicity based on traits for phylogenetically related nearest neighbor viruses as a first approximation and incorporating more detailed data from genomic characterization and animal model experiments (Aim 1 ). Epidemiological trait data for ~300 viral species known to infect people (e.g. case fatality rate, global estimates of number of human cases per year or decade, Ro, infectious period, and primary symptoms) have been collated by recent studies and will be used as -···FLIRT predictor variables (189). Thirdly, we will apply tools already developed, Research Strategy and being refined by EHA under DTRA and DHS supported research. to predict pandemic spread for viruses using global flight models, as well as additional datasets on human movement and connectivity across Southeast Asia (90, 91) (Fig. 15). Fig. 15: Probability feed from EHA's Flight Risk Tracker tool (FLIRT). This image is of the likely pathways of spread and establishment for a Nipah-like virus emerging from Sabah, based on human movement and airline flight data (90, 91). 22 Page 298Contact PD/Pl: DASZAK, PETER 3.7 Potential problems/alternative approaches: Patients visiting clinics may have cleared virus, but not yet developed lgG antibodies, reducing seropositive cases. Our 35 day follow-up sampling should account for this because the maximum lag time between SARS infection and lgG development is ~28 days and Ebola virus infection and lgG approximately 20 days ( 185-188, 190). We also expect that patients in rural communities will only visit clinics when symptoms have progressed, likely coinciding with late illness and onset of lgG. We will also have data from our community study that can be analyzed in conjunction with, or in the absence of, clinical data from the hospital data to identify PCR- or seropositives. Finally, the risk of limited detection is outweighed by the potential public health importance of discovering active spillover of new henipaviruses, FVs or Co Vs infection. 4. Administrative Plan 4.1. Project management: 4.1.a. Administrative core: The EID-SEARCH organizational partner roles are laid out by Specific Aim above (see Fig. 3). EcoHealth Alliance (EHA) will lead the administrative core of the EID-SEARCH, including: coordination and management of all human and animal research; communication with consortium partners, NIH, other EIDRCs, and the EIDRC-CC; data management and quality assurance; modeling and analysis; and compliance with all US, international, and institutional rules and regulations. The administration will be led by Pl Daszak, who has >20 years' experience managing international research collaborations on emerging zoonoses, and has collaborated with all partners in the EIDRC consortium for 5-20 yrs on NIAID- and USAID-funded research (Fig. 16). He also has direct experience as one of two external reviewers of one of the CEIRS partners for NIAID (Program officer Diane Post). Pl Daszak will be assisted by Deputy Lead, co-I Oliva!, who has overseen zoonotic disease research in Southeast Asia for >10 years and working directly with our partners in Thailand and Malaysia for 15 years.

Fig. 16: Administration and program management for the EID-SEARCH The EID-SEARCH core laboratory team includes global experts in virology, molecular pathogenesis, and the development of assays, reagents, and therapeutics for high consequence viral zoonoses (Co-ls Wang, Anderson at Duke-NUS; Barie, Sims at UNC; Broder, Laing at USU; Keusch, Corley at NEIDL). The core laboratory team will work with in-country diagnostic labs in Thailand (Wacharapluesedee, Hemachudha at the TRC-EID, Chulalongkorn University) and Malaysia (Hughes, Lee, CM Ltd.). Wacharapluesedee and Hughes will additionally serve as country coordinators for the EID-SEARCH, liaising directly with EHA on weekly conference calls, and working with in-country partners to ensure the smooth operation and coordination of clinical and community surveillance and wildlife research in Thailand and Malaysia, respectively. A Core Executive Committee comprising Pl Daszak, Deputy Lead and Co-I Olival, and leads from each core partner and country: Co-ls Hughes, Wacharapleusadee, Barie, Wang, Broder, Keusch (or alternates), will conduct 23 Page 299 Research StrategyContact PD/Pl: DASZAK, PETER regular conference calls and in-person meetings to facilitate rapid decision making within the EID-SEARCH. This committee will also convene to manage EID-SEARCH response to outbreaks. 4.1.b Project Management in Thailand and Malaysia: Wacharapluesedee and Hughes have collaborated directly with EHA for >15 years, including acting as country coordinators on the USAID PREDICT project for the last 10 years (project end date Sept. 2019). They maintain strong ties with Ministries of Health (MOH), Agriculture and Environment, multiple universities and research institutions, clinics, and hospitals, in their respective countries and across the region. The EID-SEARCH will use these connections to disseminate results, obtain permissions to conduct sampling, and also rapidly respond to and assist with outbreaks as they happen. Peninsular Malaysia, Sarawak, and Sabah are the three main Malaysian administrative regions, and effectively operate as three separate countries, with different regulations and government structures. We therefore provide specific details on the management of EID-SEARCH activities in each: Coordination among Peninsular Malaysia, Sabah and Sarawak will be led by co-I Hughes (Conservation Medicine Ltd), and follow a successful model we implemented under USAID-PREDICT. On Peninsular Malaysia this project will be administered through the Zoonosis Technical Working Committee (ZTWC) established under the PREDICT project with a binding MOU among EHA, CM Ltd. and ZTWC, and including officers from MOH, Dept. of Veterinary Services, and PERHILITAN (the Govt. wildlife agency). EHA will communicate weekly with Co-I Hughes to coordinate and monitor implementation of research and reporting to ZTWC. Co-I Hughes will coordinate activities at all other Peninsular Malaysia institutions: NPHL, the National reference laboratory for diagnostic confirmation of pathogens, will manage molecular and serological screening (BioPlex) of Orang Asli samples, and serological screening of syndromic samples from Sabah and Sarawak; the PERHILITAN molecular zoonosis laboratory will store and conduct molecular and serological screening on wildlife samples; and Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM) Faculty of Veterinary Medicine will conduct molecular and serological screening (BioPlex) of livestock samples, should these be required. For Sabah & Sarawak, work will be administered through the Sabah Zoonotic Diseases Committee (SZOC), a working technical committee comprising appointed and authorized officers from Sabah State Health Dept., Department of Veterinary Services, Sabah Wildlife Dept. (SWD), Universiti Malaysia Sabah (UMS) and EHA, all of which are also committed through a signed MOU. Co-I Hughes will oversee work at all other partners in Sabah, including: the Kata Kinabalu Public Health Lab (KKPHL) for molecular screening of syndromic samples from Sabah and Sarawak; the SWD Wildlife Health and Genetic and Forensics Lab for molecular screening of Sabah wildlife samples; The Borneo Medical Health Research Center (BMHRC) for screening some Sabah wildlife and livestock samples, if required, and human syndromic samples from Sabah and Sarawak. In Thailand all human community and wildlife research and testing will be coordinated by co-I Wacharapluesedee from the TRC-EID center. Clinical surveillance will be overseen by senior clinical physician and co-IT. Hemachudha. 4.1.c. Approval and release of results: In our experience, it is critical when working in resource-poor countries, on potentially important pathogens, to strictly adhere to protocols for release of results. EID�SEARCH will liaise with existing points of contact in the Ministries of Health, Environment, and Agriculture in each our administrative areas to approve and release project findings publicly. Results from human screening will be shared with participants when they become available, as per our IRB agreements ensuring no violations to anonymize data requirements (see Protection of Human Subjects). 4.2. Flexibility to extend the EID-SEARCH to new sites as needed: The EID-SEARCH consortium partners maintain extensive working relationships with leaders in EID outbreak control, clinical investigations and research at over 50 clinics, research institutes and public health laboratories across Southeast Asia. Due to space constraints, we haven't listed each of these, nor have we solicited >50 Letters of Support for this project. However, each core EID-SEARCH partner has contacted their networks and obtained permission for inclusion in the broader goals of the EIDRC. As examples of these contacts, our core partner, the Thai Red Cross Emerging Infectious Disease Health Science Centre (TRC-EID) at Chulalongkorn University, also serves as the WHO Collaborating Centre for Research and Training on Viral Zoonoses and has ongoing research collaborations across WHO SEARO countries including Bangladesh, Bhutan, Democratic People's Republic of Korea, India, Indonesia, Maldives, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka, (Thailand), Timor-Leste; and has recently served as a training hub for scientists from Malaysia, Myanmar, Laos, the Philippines, and China to learn methods of wildlife sampling and diagnostic screening. Our Thai clinicians (Co-I T. Hemachudha and KP P. 24 Page 300 Research StrategyContact PD/Pl: DASZAK, PETER Hemachudha) provide regular case consultations and clinical trainings for doctors across SEARO countries, including with Yangoon General Hospital and the National Health Lab in Myanmar, 2018. To maximize leverage of this broad network, EHA has budgeted for annual meetings in SE Asia, in addition to regular smaller network meetings, with our core team and key public health experts from network labs in each of the 10 SE Asian countries. Additionally, we will set up a listserv and an internal communication network to facilitate collaboration and information exchange, including on the first reports of new disease outbreaks. Our annual and smaller network meetings will critically allow face-to-face meetings of the EID-SEARCH that will foster greater sharing of information on novel research and diagnostic approaches, pathogens that are of key pandemic potential, regions or populations at high risk of spillover, and information from the greater network on likely outbreaks of novel disease. This platform will coordinate sample sharing and diagnostic platforms and help build a rapid response to outbreaks in the region, guided by the Pl, Deputy and the Executive Committee. 4.3. Outbreak response: EHA collaboration with expert networks around the world allows us to mobilize and enhance effective One Health response to disease emergencies (191), ranging from real-time situation updates and risk analyses to on-the-ground investigations (192-194). We will adopt management tools from Emergency Operating Center (EOCs) (195) and Incident Management Systems (IMS) (196), to shift resources where necessary to help respond to novel zoonotic outbreak events and other public health emergencies. EHA has extensive experience working with governments in low and middle income countries (LMIC) applying these principles of epidemic preparedness during outbreak responses we've been involved with under the USAID�PREDICT project. For example, at the request of the government of Bangladesh, we provided technical field and laboratory support for Nipah virus and avian influenza outbreak investigations, assisting with wildlife sampling as part of the outbreak response alongside human and domestic animal sampling. In India, we provided technical assistance in response to the Nipah virus outbreak in Kerala in 2018. Last month in Indonesia were assisted the Ministry of Health's Center for Health Laboratory in Makassar to provide technical assistance in a mysterious outbreak in a small village in South Sulawesi that killed 4 villagers and infected 72. Our network partners include the key government and govt. approved laboratories that would be directly involved in public health emergency response in their respective countries. The serological and PCR platforms that EID-SEARCH develops will be made available to the main government outbreak investigation teams for clinical work and research during the outbreak. EID-SEARCH will also offer assistance training and conducting animal sampling during an outbreak, epidemiological analysis and modeling to help identify likely reservoirs or likely pathways to spread. Technical and material support for lab, field and analytical activities during an outbreak will be provided by EHA, UNC, USU, Duke-NUS, and NEIDL, as well as in-country partners. Any clinical samples, viral isolates and sequence data will be shared among partners to promote the rapid development of new diagnostic assays, reagents, and therapeutics that can be deployed to the region or other regions as part of the larger NIH EIDRC network. Finally, while the initial pathogen focus of our group is on CoVs, PMVs and FVs, our broad collaborative group has multidisciplinary expertise on a number of virus-host systems. For example: Pl Daszak was Pl on a subaward from Pl Laura Kramer's U01 on Poxviruses and Flaviviruses, managing a multidisciplinary research project on West Nile virus ecology. He was also co-I on a 5-year NSF-funded project to understand West Nile virus dynamics and risk in the USA (197-201); Co-I Barie is a global leader in Norovirus research leading to the development of vaccines and therapeutics (202-205); Co-I Wang has conducted significant work on bat immunology, therapeutic, and reagent development, as well as being involved in a range of outbreak investigations, viral discovery programs and other research on a wide diversity of viral groups (206-215). Additionally, the serological and PCR-based diagnostic platforms being developed by Co-ls Wang and Broder are adaptable to other viral targets. The modeling tools developed by Co-ls Olival and Zambrana-Torrelio can be used to predict the emergence and spread of diverse viral targets, including influenza, antimicrobial resistance, and vector-borne diseases (216-221). Our clinicians working in Thailand and Malaysia have a wide range of infectious disease investigations to adapt to any outbreak situation. 4.4. Communications: EHA will coordinate communication among all co-ls and key personnel, including: • Multiple meetings per week with Pl, Deputy Lead, Senior Program Manager (on project and task status) • Weekly web/phone meetings between Program Manager and subawardee admin. staff • Monthly web/phone conferences between EHA Pis and all subawardee Pis. 25 Page 301 Research StrategyContact PD/Pl: DASZAK, PETER • Monthly web conferences between key personnel (research presentations/coordination) • In-person Annual meetings with partner leads, key personnel at EHA and two in-person partner meetings annually between subawardees. • Annual in-person meeting among all key personnel 4.5. Problem identification and resolution: Regular planning, monitoring, and evaluation meetings will be the primary mechanisms for problem identification. Minor problems (e.g. delays in sample availability or test results) will be dealt with internally through appropriate action and resolution monitored by Pl Daszak and co-I Oliva!, and our Senior Program Manager. In the event of significant problems, such as prolonged poor productivity, inadequate scientific collaboration, or major disputes regarding research direction or resource allocation, EHA will assist with resolving the problem through negotiation with relevant co-ls and consultation with the Executive Committee. Should a resolution not be forthcoming, consultation with the EIDRC-CC, additional external technical advisors, and NIH staff may be warranted. 4.6. Adaptive management and risk mitigation: Maintaining a timeline and meeting milestones will require strict and continuous oversight of all project phases, frequent and regularly scheduled communication, and the ability to make decisions and implement strategies. To maintain our timeline on all projects, including the EID-SEARCH, we use an adaptive management approach to continually evaluate these trade-offs, to make decisions about when iteration is appropriate and when it is necessary to move forward with current information. Our ethos is that regular, scheduled communication among all staff, partners and collaborators will go a long way towards mitigating risks, especially if the process is collaborative and transparent. 5. Data Management Plan EHA will house the Data Management and Analysis (OMA) team for EID-SEARCH, led by Co-Pis Oliva! and Zambrana-Torreilo and include Key Personnel Latinne and Mendelsohn. EHA has served as the data and analysis hub for numerous multi-institutional, multi-sectoral, international disease research groups, including acting as Modeling and Analytics lead for the PREDICT project (122), the Western Asia Bat Research Network (222) and EHA's Rift Valley Fever Consortium. We will leverage our experience and infrastructure from those projects to benefit the EID-SEARCH. 5.1. Project Database: We will create a dedicated, centralized EID�SEARCH database to ingest, store, link, and provide for analysis all data associated with the proposed study and other expanded projects associated with the research network. The database will be SOL-based and use encrypted, secure cloud hosting services and enable export to archival and platform-independent formats. It will ensure data and metadata compatibility between project components, track data versioning and annotations. The system will be designed to work with both with both paper- and tablet-based field data entry and with the Lockbox laboratory information management systems (Section 5.2) in place in individual partner labs. The database will use existing metadata standards, including NCBI standards for genetic and molecular data and Ecological Metadata Language (EML) for field and wildlife data, as well as other standards and formats designated by the EIRDC CC. This will enable rapid publication and deposition of data. Granular security and privacy controls will be applied so that specific expansion projects undertaken in the network may be managed while maintaining data confidentiality as needed. 5.2. Biological Specimen Management: Project laboratories will use the Lockbox Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS), to manage the security, traceability, and quality of biological specimens. The LIMS will support sample barcoding at creation, tracking through transport, storage/inventory, and use via portable scanners. Lockbox supports CLIA and ISO 17025 as well as direct export to NCBI formats such as Sequence Read Archive. We will use the Lockbox LIMS application programming interface (API) to link to the central project database and associated samples with field and ecological data. We note that the project focuses on highly pathogenic viruses, including select agents; Lockbox LIMS supports sample tracking and movement compliant with US Select Agent Regulations and US Department of Commerce Pathogen Import and Export Control Regulations, and includes all necessary encryption, security, and backup protocols. 5.3. Training: Members of the OMA team will team will develop documentation and provide training for field and laboratory teams at all partner institutions in data management, metadata standards and data hygiene best practices. The OMA team will act as trainers and consultants for partner institutions in experimental 26 Page 302 Research StrategyContact PD/Pl: DASZAK, PETER design, power analysis, data analysis, and computational and reproducibility issues, and visit each partner institution and/or field team base for training workshops and analysis consultations. 5.4. Data Identification and Privacy: For human clinical data and questionnaires, data will be identified by a unique identification code assigned to each individual and only this, de-identified code will be accessible in the project database, and destroyed at the end of the project - as per details provided in the Clinical Management Plan and Protection of Human Subjects forms. 5.5. Computing Resources: EHA operates a cluster of high-performance servers for data analysis activities, as well as infrastructure to launch cloud-based computing environments (see EHA Facilities). Our servers host all necessary software for statistical and bioninformatics work that is available to the OMA and partners anywhere in the world. We use a mixture of cloud services (AWS, Azure, Backblaze, GitHub) to provide redundancy, backup, version control, and rapid post-disaster recovery, and will be available to all project partners for analysis and training. 5.6. Data and Code Sharing: See details provided in the Resource Sharing Plan. 6. Clinical Management Plan 6.1. Clinical site selection: Our consortium partners have been conducting lab and human surveillance research, including during outbreaks, for >20 years and have developed strong relationships with local clinical facilities and processes in SE Asia and in LMIC globally. The plan for selection of clinical sites will begin in the same geographic regions as those identified in Aim 1 with high zoonotic viral diversity. Clinical sites will additionally serve as the catchment healthcare facilities for people in our community-based surveillance of Aim 2. We have already developed successful working relationships with the major healthcare facilities in Thailand and Malaysia and will use these established partners to rapidly gain appropriate permits and begin data collection quickly. Focusing on these EID hotspots in select biogeographic areas (see Fig 13) also reduces the number of additional sites needed to meet our goals within our geographic range. The capacity and capability requirements for clinical sites are fairly minimal, and include ability to enroll patients that meet the clinical case definitions of interest, collect and temporarily store biological samples, and follow standards for data management and subject protection with locked filing cabinets to store all paper records and an encrypted computer. We will be enrolling inpatient and outpatient participants within 10 days of the presentation of symptoms to increase the chance of PCR detection of viruses so we will not wait for advanced normative diagnostic tests, that are likely unavailable in the more remote sites, to be completed. We will work with clinical sites to determine the best process for project staff, in most cases supporting the time of currently hired staff at each site. We will recruit and train hospital staff in project-specific procedures including enrollment of patients, sample types to be collected, storage of samples, administration of the questionnaire, and data management plans. During the development and on boarding of new clinical sites we will assess the physical needs of the site and what supplies will be required for collection of data. 6.2. Standardized approach, oversight, and implementation: Management and oversite for all study sites will be undertaken by the local country coordinator with support from our Core Administrative team at EHA. Our research team has over 10 years of experience building capacity on human subjects' research and has developed training resources and materials for standardized implementation of community and clinical research and SOPs for screening, enrollment, and retention of participants. The country coordinator will conduct regular site visits to the clinical sites and annual visits to observe, monitor and evaluate the research process, and conduct follow-up training if required. Through our work with clinical sites under the USAID�PREDICT project we have developed culturally appropriate screening measures for clinal sites that do not disrupt the flow or quality of medical treatment received by the patient. This was done by working collectively with clinical staff to evaluate current procedures and patient flow at the site to determine the most efficient while minimal invasive inclusion of our study into the daily working of the clinal site. Most efficiently this was done by adding minimal basic screening questions to the current clinal intake forms, which allows the clinal research officer to quickly scan charts or logs for potential patients to enroll avoiding potential enrollees from being overlooked if staff are too busy or not on duty. Patients will be enrolled following established clinical criteria (see Section 6.3), samples collected and brief surveys conducted to assess the participants contact with wildlife through: 1) occupational exposures; 2) animal contact; and 3) the environment. With permission 27 Page 303 Research StrategyContact PD/Pl: DASZAK, PETER from each clinic, and consent from participants, we will review clinical records to collect data on medical history, clinical syndromes, and patient etiology. Additionally, we will be following up with clinical participants to determine how clinical presentation differs between CoV, henipavirus, or FV in exposed and unexposed participants, as well as in the time course of illness, severity of symptoms, and type of symptoms. The country coordinator will be continually monitoring the project database to ensure we hit target sample sizes. While patient's enrollment is limited by the number of individuals presenting at hospitals, in previous research we enrolled an average of 105 patients per year, ranging from 77-244. 6.3. Clinical cohort setup, recruitment, enrollment: We will recruit inpatients and outpatients from clinical sites to participate in the study after initial screening to determine if they meet the clinical case definitions for 1) severe/acute respiratory illness (SARI/ARI); 2) Influenza-like illness (ILi); 3) fever of unknown origin (FUO); 4) encephalitis; 5) hemorrhagic fever, of unknown etiology or severe diarrhea with unusual presentation for symptoms to increase the chance of PCR detection of viruses. Once enrolled, biological samples will be collected by trained hospital staff. When possible, samples will be taken concurrently with samples being collected for normative diagnostics. We will collect 5ml of blood for whole blood and serum collection, samples will be aliquoted, at least one max. 500 µL whole blood; two 500 µL serum samples and two nasal or oropharyngeal swabs will be collected. Controls who test positive for CoVs, FVs, or Henipaviruses will be selected from the pool of participants admitted to the studies and whose samples tested negative for coronaviruses, henipavirus, or filoviruses. We will follow up 35 days after enrollment to collect an additional 5ml blood draw for collection of two 500 µL serum samples and a standardized questionnaire supplement to collect additional data on the course of symptoms in the interim period. Following up 35 days post initial collection gives adequate time for 1) development of lgG and lgM, which occurs <28 days after onset of symptoms to evaluate the immunological progression of disease and 2) further the risk assessment of the participants to monitor contact with wildlife, people, and to assess the likely reservoir hosts to collect information to inform potential intervention programs. 6.4. Utilization of collected data: Sampling of wildlife and the enrollment of community surveillance participants and a clinical cohort of participants give us the ability to assess the viruses that are circulating in each of the three populations in a similar geographic region. We will use phylogenetic analysis to compare the relationship between wildlife viruses found and viruses fond in human participants. Additionally, the questionnaire data will allow us to assess relative measures of human-wildlife contact that we will analyze the intensity of contact with species known to be at a higher risk for spillover against other risk to provide useful proxy information for spillover risk. The clinical cohort will be split into cases and controls. "Cases" are defined as participants whose samples tested positive for either CoV, henipavirus, or FV via PCR tests. "Controls" will be selected from the pool of participants admitted to the studies and whose samples tested negative. We will use nearest neighbor matching to pair cases demographically (e.g. age, sex, location) with controls at a 1-to-3 ratio or greater. In clinical study, we will use this procedure to determine how clinical presentation differs between virus-exposed and -unexposed participants, as well as in the time course of illness, severity of symptoms, and type of symptoms. We will model the outcomes to analyze correlation between biological results and risk factors related to high risk wildlife exposure. With this collective data set we aim to quantify and detect novel viruses likely to spillover regularly to people, are often unreported or misdiagnosed as their clinical manifestations, and are unknown to detect cryptic outbreaks causing previously 'hidden' clinical syndromes in people. Our strategy for targeted surveillance and detection of spillover and illness in at-risk human populations can be used as an 'early warning system' to conduct public health interventions and disrupt disease emergence. 6.5. Development of reagents of value to the community~ Members of the EID-SEARCH consortium have substantial experience producing reagents, assays, and other products that are used widely by the clinical and research community, and some of which are on a pathway to commercialization. These include: Pis Daszak and Co-I Olival have produced software for analyzing the spread of novel viral agents through air travel networks; Co-I Barie has collaborated with a Norovirus surveillance collaboration with surveillance cohort at CDC and has developed therapeutics that have reached phase 2 and 3 clinical trials, He is currently working with Takeda Sanofi Pasteur on a Dengue therapeutic and with NIH on a tetravalent vaccine; Co-I Broder 28 Page 304 Research StrategyContact PD/Pl: DASZAK, PETER developed a Hendra virus subunit vaccine that was commercially produced by Zoetis for horses and is labeled for human use under compassionate circumstances during outbreak situations. 6.6. Potential expansion: Expansion of the research project to other clinical sites or research areas could happen as new information is gathered, either through our research, the EID-SEARCH information network, or an outbreak being identified in the region by other organizations. If expansion is required we would rapidly shift research activities towards the clinical or community sites where the outbreak is active, using the same process we used to set up initial research locations. First, by working with local stakeholders to create a working relationship and on-boarding new clinical research staff through advanced trainings of project aims, SOPs on data collection and storage, and ethical guidelines. The network of infectious disease researchers in the community and hospital settings would allow for an accelerated response to any potential infectious disease outbreaks as staff are well trained on ethical guidelines for working with human subjects, data and specimen collection, storage, and transpiration, project staff would be on the front lines ready for the call to action. Ideally, our testing for viruses in priority viral families may lead to the discovery cryptic outbreaks before it spreads in the general public. Biological results coupled with survey data on key risk factors will provided necessary information for granular understand of disease spread. 7. Statistical Analysis Plan: 7.1. Framework: Statistical analyses across the project will be conducted under a common Bayesian framework. These models provide a unified, probabilistic approach best-suited for estimating effect sizes in heterogenous populations of human clinical and wildlife subjects in observational studies. Within this Bayesian framework, we will use generalized linear mixed models to estimate population prevalences and seroprevalences, and estimate the effects of demographic, occupational and environmental factors affecting these. We will use occupancy models (223) to estimate total viral species and strain diversity and completeness of sampling within the human and wildlife sub-populations, and discrete phylogeographic models to identify taxonomic and geographic centers of viral diversification. All statistical analyses will be performed reproducibly using scripted, programmatic workflows (e.g., the Rand Stan languages) and maintained under source code version control (git). As with data management, the OMA team will act as trainers and consultants for exploratory data analysis, power analysis, and study design with project partners, and the EHA computing cluster will be available for partners undertaking additional or expansion studies. Power analyses, current and expansion, are performed via simulation approaches allowing planning for complex, hierarchical variation in study populations. Power analyses and specific analytical components of this study are detailed under each Specific Aim. 7.2. Data Quality Control and Data Harmonization: All data will be are examined at entry by field and lab teams upon data entry, followed by examination by OMA team members at upload and integration, for complete de-identification, completeness, accuracy, and logical consistency. The OMA will provide field and lab teams with reports, produced automatically, of data summaries, including aggregates, distribution, detected outliers and possible mis-entries. On a regular basis (quarterly or as-needed during data collection), OMA team members will review reports with field and lab teams to identify errors and update collection and entry procedures as necessary. 7.3. Statistical Considerations for Behavioral Questionnaires and Clinical Metadata: The data collected from the questionnaire will be analyzed to assess the reported measures of contact for each risk group under study, related to1) occupation and occupational exposures; 2) observed or reported interactions with priority wildlife, especially bats, rodents, and primates in/around house and other livestock animals (e.g. farming, butchering, slaughtering); 3) proximity of residence or workplace to environments of increased risks (e.g. nearby bat roosts); 4) working or regular visitor to animal markets; 5) self-reported ILi/SARi clinical diagnosis or symptoms in the past 12 months and lifetime. Specific measures we are interested in are the proportion of respondents indicating they consume wildlife, where wildlife is obtained for consumption, have hunted wildlife, butchered or slaughtered live animals, seen wildlife in their homes, been bitten or scratched by animals, etc. Comparisons of measures of exposure contacts and types between men and women, children and adults, different study regions will be conducted in order to explore the occupational, environmental, and demographic factors (gender, age, socioeconomic status (SES)) that influence contact with animals and to determine who is 29 Page 305 Research StrategyContact PD/Pl: DASZAK, PETER most at-risk. Statistical analysis will be employed to identify differences between groups with a 95% probably of detecting a difference. Measures of contact related to different activities within specific groups will be compared to determine the activities that put groups at most risk. As appropriate multivariate analysis (e.g. ordinary linear regression, logistic regression, non-normal distributions of outcome, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression, etc.) will be utilized to evaluate the relationship between the outcome variables, positive biological results (PCR or serology) key measures of contact and the factors that influence frequency and types of human-animal contact. 8.

We will make every effort to have men and women equally represented in this study and no individuals will be excluded based on ethnicity. • At community sites, living or working around wildlife habitats (e.g. bat caves/roosts), who hunt wildlife, work with wildlife or livestock farming, transportation, selling, or slaughtering wildlife in the surveyed areas will be the primary criteria for identifying participants in community. • At clinic sites, only patients who present at the healthcare facility who meet the clinical case definition of 1) severe/acute respiratory illness (SARI/ARI); 2) Influenza-like illness (ILi); 3) fever of unknown origin (FUO); 4) encephalitis; or 5) hemorrhagic fever; or 6) diarrhea in combination with any of the previously mentioned illnesses of unknown etiology will be recruited for this study, and no patients will be excluded based on ethnicity or gender. INCLUSION OF CHILDREN: Children aged 12-17 years will be included in this study, and there will be no maximum age restriction for adults, at both community and clinical sites • Previous clinic-based studies have shown that children are one of the major populations who present to healthcare facilities with severe/acute respiratory illness (SARI/ARI), Influenza-like illness (ILi), or fever of unknown origin (FUO). Our behavioral study in Thailand and Malaysia also suggested the close contact with wild animals among children in the study regions via activities of animal hunting, trade, or butchering. • Children aged 12 years or older are post-primary school in Thailand and Malaysia and are able to comprehend and respond to the questionnaire autonomously which increases the reliability of responses. We will not enroll children aged 12-17 years without an accompanying parent or guardian who is able to provide informed consent, or a child aged 12-17 who is unable to or unwilling to provide assent. • Children under age 12 in target communities are mainly school children who have very limited exposures to wild animals under the scenarios of interest to the study, and ethically we do not want to collect or enroll participants without strong scientific need for inclusion. We will not enroll children who are wars of the state • Every effort will be made to protect the privacy, dignity, and well-being of children who participate in this study. Our in-country human research team are well-trained medical doctors and researchers who have extensive experience working with children, as well as their parents, at both community and clinical settings. Prior to the start of human subject research activities, all research staff will be CITl-trained and further trained on conducting ethical human subject research training including a module on the special considerations for working with children Page 312 Inclusion of Women, Minorities, and ChildrenContact PD/Pl: DASZAK, PETER Program Director/Principal Investigator: Daszak, Peter regarding risk and coercion. Enrollment of children will be monitored and annually reported to the IRB. Page 313 Inclusion of Women, Minorities, and ChildrenContact PD/Pl: DASZAK, PETER Program Director/Principal Investigator: Daszak, Peter RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION PLAN In order to improve recruitment within target communities, introductory visits will be made by project staff to each of the selected sub-sites. These visits will be advertised through word of mouth and a project description letter to village/town/city leaders and letters that can be posted or shared in a central community location. The letter will inform the community that a team will be coming on a particular day(s) to enroll voluntary participants and after discuss health issues related to animal contact. This letter will be for informational sharing not be used for recruitment purposes. It will only be used to inform the community of the research visits. The project description letter will be written in the local language with a Flesch-Kincaid readability score equivalent to a 7th grade reading level or below (primary school in Thailand and Malaysia), to assure that community leaders and potential community participants understand the study purpose, eligibility, and inclusion guidelines. Community visits will begin with discussions and meetings with local authorities and community leaders to introduce ourselves and our project, and when appropriate following approval from local authorities, the study team will post flyers to inform the community when the team will be speaking about enrollment and later coming back to enroll interested individuals. Attending this "town hall" style meeting will be completely voluntary and based on our experience, those interested are likely to attend. Although local authorities may be present to introduce the study team members, they will not be involved in the recruitment and/or consent of the participants for the study. Individuals will be clearly informed during the recruitment process that their participation in the study is voluntary. If research visits or recruitment events are held at a workplace individuals choice of involvement will not impact their employment, nor will information discussed be shared with employers. With local permissions and accompanied by local community leaders, district health officers, or authorities the study team members will engage in community town halls and 'walkabouts' during which they will discuss study details, dates, times, and locations for enrollment and participation in the study. Participation in the study will be strictly voluntary and will require signed informed consent for all participants and signed assent for participants aged 12-17 along with parent or guardian consent. During the enrollment process interested individuals will be given a consent form and research staff will read the consent form to potential participants. Together they will review the consent form and study staff will explain details of the study including: why they were selected, what the study procedures are and what will be expected from them, potential risks and benefits of their participation, that their participation is completely voluntary, and that they can withdraw their participation at any time. After reviewing the consent form individuals will be given as much time as needed to ask questions. At that time if individuals wish to participate they will sign two copies of the consent form and it will be countersigned by the research staff, with a copy given to the participant for their records. Included in the consent form is the contact information for local research staff and a local IRB contact for participants if they have questions in the future. Responses will be kept strictly confidential. Measures will be taken to assure the privacy, dignity, and respect of each participant. Ethical human subjects research methods will be a focus in all training of research staff, we will emphasize the importance of avoiding coercion during enrollment and protecting the privacy of participants. Community-based recruitment: Participants from the community will be recruited through town hall meetings and community 'walkabouts' as described above. Meeting dates, times, and locations for enrollment and participation will be shared during these activities, and individuals who wish to enroll can volunteer to participate at these times and locations. Clinic-based recruitment: Patients eligible for enrollment will be identified during standard intake procedures or from overnight intake logs, or in the emergency room, ward, or intensive care unit of each participating clinic or hospital by collaborating clinic staff. Employed staff at each location will identify potential participants meeting the clinical case definition of 1) severe/acute respiratory illness (SARI/ARI); 2) Influenza-like illness (ILi); 3) fever of unknown origin (FUO); 4) encephalitis; 5) hemorrhagic fever; or 6) diarrhea in combination with any of the previously mentioned illnesses of unknown etiology. Patients will be screened for eligibility according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria based on available clinical information and clinical presentation. We have set a minimum target enrollment sample size to detect live virus in patients at each hospital assuming a population prevalence of 1% with a 95% probability. We will work with the local institution review board to determine the maximum enrollment of patients without undue burden on the population. However, in larger Page 314 Recruitment and Retention PlanContact PD/Pl: DASZAK, PETER Program Director/Principal Investigator: Daszak, Peter tertiary healthcare centers where many cases fitting study inclusion are expected or are being enrolled we will regularly evaluate enrollment logs to be sure we are prepared to collect samples throughout the length of the sample collection timeline as to not miss a change in circulating virus. If we need to control the number of patients being enrolled at a hospital interval sampling will be implemented by selecting every Nth case of those individuals who meet enrollment criteria. The interval will be determined in collaboration with the local research staff and implementing partners based on an evaluation of the enrolled participants to date and expected number of cases presenting at the site within a given year in order to best meet study design and sample size criteria and stay IRB compliant. In terms of retention, we will express our gratitude to subjects for their participation and discuss the research importance of the follow-up data collection. Nonetheless, we expect to have an approximate 40% loss to follow up and have included this in our sample size calculations. Page 315 Recruitment and Retention PlanContact PD/Pl: DASZAK, PETER Program Director/Principal Investigator: Daszak, Peter STUDY TIMELINE At each sampling time point, patients/participants will be asked to volunteer approximately 1 hour of their time for participation in the study, including providing biological samples and completing the questionnaire. This will be an ongoing five-year project from the time of award. • We anticipate obtaining all required IRB approvals and local permissions in the first 6 months of projects; • We will start human subject enrollment at community and clinical sites in Year 0.5 at the earliest, and enrollment will continue through Year 5, to be completed by the conclusion of the project; • Human sample testing will start in Year 0.5 at the earliest, with completion of analyses by the end of the award.

Risks to Human Subjects 1.1 Human Subjects Involvement, Characteristics, and Design This project is a study of human spillover and exposure to animal coronaviruses, henipaviruses, and filoviruses in Southeast Asia, with active sample collection in Thailand and Malaysia and testing of archived samples in Singapore. As there is substantial evidence that these viruses likely spillover regularly to people, are often unreported or misdiagnosed and thus underestimated; and this targeted surveillance and detection of spillover and illness in at-risk human populations can be used as an 'early warning system' to conduct public health interventions and disrupt disease emergence Subjects will be enrolled on a voluntary basis and informed consent will be obtained from all participants and assent from all participants aged 12-17. Consenting participants will provide biological samples for PCR or serological testing and complete a questionnaire to collect information on wildlife exposures and frequency. Subjects will be individuals: 1) who are highly exposed to wildlife, specifically bats, rodents, and non-human primates, in community settings, through hunting, butchering, or general handling within the context of their living or working environments (::2:: 18 years old); and 2) patients admitted to hospitals and clinics presenting with disease symptoms of clinically-defined 1) severe/acute respiratory illness (SARI/ARI); 2) Influenza-like illness (ILi); 3) fever of unknown origin (FUO); 4) encephalitis; or 5) hemorrhagic fever; or 6) diarrhea in combination with any of the previously mentioned illnesses of unknown etiology. The study population will be selected from the subnational geographic hotspot regions listed in Aim 1. We will enroll participants from: 1) communities at 4 sub-sites from each of the regions of interest in Ratchaburi (Thailand), Chonburi (Thailand), Peninsular Malaysia, Sabah Malaysia, and Sarawak, 175 individuals from each of sub-site in the 5 regions will be collected and pooled across the region for a total of 700 participants per region, allowing us to make region-level comparisons of differing effects, enrolling a total of 3,500 participants; and 2) patients from the selected 2 town-level level clinics and 2 provincial�level hospitals in each of the geographic regions of Thailand, Peninsular Malaysia, Sabah and Sarawak, we will enroll a minimum of 300 participants per clinic or hospital, for a total of 16 healthcare facilities and 4,800 total clinical participants. This will yield 2,880 participants that will be available for follow-up blood sampling assuming for an estimated 40% loss from follow-up. The community and clinical sites are further defined in Specific Aims 2 and 3. There are no data to suggest a gender or ethnic bias for coronaviruses, henipaviruses, and filoviruses exposure or infection, therefore individuals will be enrolled based on exposure criteria alone and individuals will not be excluded based on ethnicity or gender. We will also monitor sampling enrollment to ensure equal representation of sex, demographic, and socio-economic factors in each community site. 1.2 Sources of Materials Biological samples to be collected and tested for coronaviruses, henipaviruses, and filoviruses include whole blood, serum, and nasal/oropharyngeal swabs. Samples will be collected by locally trained medical personnel and a questionnaire will be administered by research or collaborating staff from the local hospitals and clinics. In community sites, whole blood samples will be collected from participants one time during the data collection period during Years 2-5 of the study. The whole blood samples will be aliquoted into at least one max. 500 µL whole blood and two 500 µL serum samples. Samples will be tested for coronaviruses, henipaviruses, and filoviruses using developed ELISA by consortium partners. For participants who report the symptoms relating to 1) severe/acute respiratory illness (SARI/ARI); 2) Influenza-like illness (ILi); 3) fever of unknown origin (FUO); 4) encephalitis; or 5) hemorrhagic fever; or 6) diarrhea in combination with any of the previously mentioned illnesses of unknown etiology within the last 10 days, an additional sample type will be collected, nasal or oropharyngeal swabs (2x). These samples will be marked for additional PCR-based assays to identify presence of known and novel coronaviruses, henipaviruses and Page 320 Protection of Human SubjectsContact PD/Pl: DASZAK, PETER Program Director/Principal Investigator: Daszak, Peter filoviruses, and for isolation and biological characterization of potential pathogens if PCR results are positive. In clinic sites, both whole blood samples and nasal/oropharyngeal swabs will be collected at enrollment, whole blood samples will be aliquoted into at least one max. 500 µL whole blood and two 500 µL serum samples. Samples will be tested for coronaviruses, henipaviruses, and filoviruses using consensus PCR (cPCR). We will follow up 35 days after enrollment to collect an additional blood sample of 5ml to be separated and aliquoted into a minimum of two 500 µL serum samples that will be serological tested with the developed ELISA assay. All blood samples will be kept frozen for future harvesting of Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) for those study participants whose serum tests are positive for emerging viral pathogens. These will be used for harvesting polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies as potential therapeutics. During data collection a standardized questionnaire will be administered to both community and clinic participants. This survey will collect data on exposure type and frequency with wildlife focusing on: 1) occupation and occupational exposures; 2) observed or reported interactions with wildlife, especially bats, rodents, and non-human primates, in/around house; 3) proximity of residence or workplace to environments of increased risks, e.g. nearby bat roosts; 4) working or regular visitor to animal markets; 5) self-reported ILi/SARi clinical diagnosis or symptoms in the past 12 months. During the follow-up with clinic participants a standardized questionnaire supplement will be administered to collect additional data on the course of symptoms in the interim period. All electronic data will be password protected, and all hardcopy files and biological samples will be stored in secure storage facilities. All consent forms and participant logs will be stored separately from research data in locked filing cabinets. 1.3 Potential Risks The potential risks to study participants as a result of study participation are minimal. The biological specimen will be collected by locally certified healthcare professionals proficient in phlebotomy techniques, the volume of blood being collected is within normal safety limits and the swab sample is not overly invasive. The questionnaire will be designed to assess exposure risk and may ask personal questions, however, administration will be conducted privately and confidentially to protect individuals' personal health and exposure information. There may be some stress or discomfort for participants who are informed that they have been exposed to a zoonotic virus, to reduce this counseling will be available and options for future medical care will be included in the discussion with the health official or physician reporting results back to individuals. 2. Adequacy of Protection against Risks 2.1 Recruitment and Informed Consent Potential study participants at each site will be recruited after obtaining local permissions and support from local community leaders, district health officers, and/or authorities the study team members will engage in community town hall meetings and 'walkabouts' during which they will discuss study details, dates, times, and locations for enrollment and participation in the study for individuals who wish volunteer to participate. The team will be trained on conducting ethical human subjects research before the commencement of data collection and enrollment of participants. This will include the importance of avoiding coercion during enrollment, protecting the privacy of participants, how to effectively communicate the research objectives, what is being asked of participants, any risks or benefits to participation, with sufficient support to be able to address any questions that potential participants may have. Training will also include a module on special populations for advanced training on working with minors during human subjects research. During the enrollment process interested individuals will be given a consent form in the local language and research staff will read the consent form to potential participants, via an interpreter in local dialects if necessary. Together they will review the consent form and study staff will explain details of the study including: why they were selected, what the study procedures are and what will be expected from them, potential risks and benefits of their participation, that their participation is completely voluntary, and that they can withdraw their participation at any time. After reviewing the consent form individuals will be given as much time as needed to Page 321 Protection of Human SubjectsContact PD/Pl: DASZAK, PETER Program Director/Principal Investigator: Daszak, Peter ask questions. At that time if individuals wish to participate they will sign two copies of the consent form and it will be countersigned by the research staff, with a copy given to the participant for their records. Contact details for local research staff member, a local IRS contact, and project Pl will be provided to all subjects in the consent form to answer any future questions or requests for withdrawal participants may have. 2.2 Protection against Risks Biological sample collection: collection of whole blood samples and nasal or oropharyngeal swab samples pose minimal risk to subjects. The potential complications associated with whole blood draw include pain and/or hematoma at the site of venipuncture. Nasal or oropharyngeal swab sample collection may cause minor irritation at the time of collection. To protect against and minimize potential complications, all biological sampling will be done by a locally trained and certified healthcare professional and/or clinic staff, and the sample collection sites will be monitored according to existing health facility protocols. Risk factor questionnaire survey: potential risks associated with the administration of the questionnaire may be discomfort or concern providing responses related to wild animal contact or consumption if practices are taboo or prohibited by local laws. To minimize this risk, questionnaire data will be collected in a strictly confidential manner. The questionnaire will be conducted in private, ensuring that others cannot overhear participant responses and a barrier will be used or created so that no other individuals can view the participants. Depending on the location, this could be a private room, behind a building or fence, or behind a line of trees, obstructing view so that confidentiality may be maintained. The interview team will take care to pair interviewers and participants by sex to the best of their ability to increase the level of comfort of the participant and the team will ensure the privacy and confidentiality of response data. Children aged 12-17 will not be interviewed in the absence of a parent or guardian. Every effort will be made to ensure the privacy, dignity, and well-being of children and adults who participate in this study. In addition, identifying information will not be linked to responses, and data will be stored in secure, password protected files or locked secure storage facilities. Participants may feel some stress or discomfort if informed that they have been exposed to a known or novel zoonotic virus, to reduce this counseling will be available and options for future medical care will be included in the discussion with the health official or physician reporting results back to individuals. Additionally, we will provide participating hospitals, clinicians, and community leaders with information and background data on relevant zoonotic viruses. 3. Potential Benefits to Subjects and Others There are no measurable benefits to the individual study participants enrolled in this study. There may be secondary benefits including receiving a physical exam/health check from a medical officer at the time of enrollment or advanced non-diagnostic testing assays that add clarity medical history for clinic participants. There are also benefits to the community and regional healthcare providers understand the risk of zoonotic infections among high-risk populations. At the conclusion of the study, we will deliver an educational workshop reporting study findings that will be open to both study and non-study participants, describing the health benefits of using PPE and hand-washing during animal handling activities throughout the day, as well as to share other prevention interventions that emerge from the research data. 4. The Importance of Knowledge to be Gained There are valuable potential benefits to the general public from the knowledge to be gained from this study. One key benefit of this study to the community an understanding the risk of zoonotic spillover events among high-risk populations. This strategy for targeted surveillance and detection of spillover and illness in at-risk human populations can be used as an 'early warning system' to conduct public health interventions and disrupt disease emergence. As well as share information with communities on practices that could reduce exposure and related health risks such as the avoidance of particular animals or the need for PPE and extra care when handling wildlife may substantially reduce the risk zoonotic pathogen transmission. Page 322 Protection of Human SubjectsContact PD/Pl: DASZAK, PETER Program Director/Principal Investigator: Daszak, Peter Knowledge gained will also increase understanding of the conditions and human activities associated with the introduction of zoonotic infections into human populations, which may have implications for disease control more broadly. Page 323 Protection of Human SubjectsContact PD/Pl: DASZAK, PETER Program Director/Principal Investigator: Daszak, Peter SINGLE INSTITUIONAL REVIEW BOARD (slRB) In compliance with the NIH Policy on the use of a single IRB of record for multi-site research EcoHealth Alliance will prepare, submit, and work the institutional review board that follows the ethical standards set forth by the HHS regulations at 45 CFR 46. Once this single IRB is approved in the US it will functions as the IRB of record and will be relied on at all planned sites and any future sites. We are currently anticipating working with Hummingbird I RB to serve as the IRB of record for all study sites. All of our local research partners, partner institutions, and study staff will rely on the IRB protocol that is approved at the IRB of record for all planned and future sites where data collection will occur. All data collection (biological and questionnaire) procedures and protocols and consent processes will be conducted using the same protocols outlined in the approved IRB of record and consistent for all location sites. The approved protocol at IRB of record will serve as the foundation for all locally submitted IRB packages in all partner countries, Thailand, Malaysia, and potential Singapore for inclusion of archived samples for testing. EcoHealth Alliance will submit for IRB approval and maintain all records, and annually manage and submit for continuing review approvals at the IRB of record. Additionally, EcoHealth Alliance will manage the authorization and reliance agreements between partners and implementation the communication plan. Each partner implementing human subjects research in Thailand, Malaysia, and Singapore will maintain regular communication with scheduled updates to the EcoHealth Alliance point of contact on enrollment and recruitment numbers, breakdown of enrollment of special populations and report any adverse events within 8 hours if not sooner. Prior to commencing study enrollment or sample testing, the partner organization that is managing human subjects enrollment in Thailand, Malaysia, and Singapore will sign a reliance agreement that will acknowledge the role of the I RB of record and responsibilities of the participating institutional partners.

Detailed description of animal use. Work with vertebrate animals will be conducted in Thailand and Malaysia for field sampling (collection of diagnostic clinical specimens) of free-ranging mammals; and the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, USA and the National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratory (NEIDL), Boston, USA for mouse model experimental infections. Wild animal captures: Capture and sampling techniques for all wild animals (bats, rodents and non-human primates) described in this study have been previously approved by multiple Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUCs) for projects led by EcoHealth Alliance. These institutions include: UC Davis IACUC (Mazet and Epstein; UC Davis 15898; current); and The Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine at Tufts University (Oliva!, Phelps, and Epstein, current), Animal Welfare Assurance (#A4059-01) on file with the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare at the National Institutes of Health. We have a draft IACUC application for this proposed project, and will submit it within 2 month of the project's start date (to Tufts University) to minimize delays in beginning Year 1 field sampling. Bats: Free-ranging bats will be captured using either a mist net or harp trap. The net system is manned by two people during the entire capture period, and bats are removed from the net as soon as they become entangled to minimize stress and prevent injury. In the Co-ls Oliva! experience, a maximum of 20-30 bats can be safely held and processed by a team of three people per trapping period. Duration of trapping will depend on the capture rate. Bats are placed into a pillowcase or small cloth bag and hung from a branch or post in a cool place until samples are collected. Bats are held for a maximum of six hours (typically less than 3 hours), and released after sampling. Rodents: Free-ranging rodents will be captured through pit traps and box traps. Food, water and shelter will be provided. Traps will be checked a minimum of twice daily, in the morning and in the afternoon. If adverse weather (extreme heat, rain) is expected or researchers are working in areas where predation is common, traps will be checked more frequently, and closed during the adverse weather. Padding, shelter and food and water will be provided in traps. Non-human primates: Free-ranging and captive non-human primates will be chemically restrained (by darting with anesthetic or through manual chemical injection), and handled only for the duration of sampling. Where possible, small primates (<15 kg) will be captured with nets, using a hoop and mesh size appropriate to the size of the animal. Alternatively, medium sized primates (e.g. free-ranging macaques) will be captured using metal traps placed on flat ground in a secure area or on a pallet constructed on a tree. Trapped animals will be transferred to a transfer cage placed against a sliding door and covered. Sample Collection from wild animals: Bats: Bats will be manually restrained during sampling. Depending on the species and size of bat, swabs will be taken from the oropharynx, urogenital tract, and rectum. Fresh feces will be collected if available, in which case a rectal swab will not be collected. Blood will be collected from smaller insectivorous bats ( <50g) using a 27g needle to puncture the brachia! artery and a 70ul hematocrit tube to collect the blood. For larger bats (>50g) we will collect blood from either the cephalic vein or from the radial artery or vein using a 25 or 23 gauge needle and 3cc syringe. Rodents: Anesthesia for captive small rodents will be conducted using plastic tubes, with the animals transferred directly from the traps to the tubes containing a cotton swab soaked in ether, isoflurane, or methoxyflurane for anesthetic induction. For larger rodents, chemical restraint and anesthesia (ketamine alone, or ketamine combined with xylazine) will be applied either through the squeeze cages by syringe if applicable. Once anesthetized a small blood sample will be collected using a capillary tube placed into the retro-orbital sinus. Only trained technicians will perform retro-orbital bleeding and it will only be performed on anesthetized rodents. Page 327 Vertebrate AnimalsContact PD/Pl: DASZAK, PETER Femoral or jugular venipuncture may be used for larger rodents (e.g. rats). In all rodents, blood volumes of no more than 1% of body weight will be withdrawn. (example 0.2 ml blood from a 20 gram rodent). Non-human primates: Chemical immobilization of any small primate species will be preceded by accurate weight determination. For anesthesia, ketamine (8-15 mg/kg depending on animal size) or a combination of tiletamine/zolazepam (7-8mg/kg in smaller animals; 4-6mg/kg in medium sized animals; 3-4mg/kg in larger animals; and 2- 3mg/kg in great apes) or ketamine/medetomidine (3.5 mg/kg ketamine and 0.035 mg/kg of medetomidine), or ketamine/xylazine (1 00mg/ml each) in a 1 :1 ratio at a dose of 1 0mg/kg IM will be administered, using low doses where possible to allow for relatively rapid sampling. Caution will be taken when administering chemical immobilizing drugs to animals in estrus to prevent against hemorrhage of the tumescent area. Immobilized animals will be allowed to recover in isolation. Sampling procedures for non-human primates will include venipuncture; fecal, urine, and external parasite collection; biopsy of lesions and/or skin samples for genetic testing; oral, nasal, urogenital and anal swabs, plucked hair and milk if/when available. Blood samples from larger primate species will primarily be collected from the forearm veins (cephalic, radial, median, and ulnar veins). In smaller species, the femoral or caudal saphenous veins will be preferred. In very small non-human primates the jugular vein may be the only option. Following handling and when appropriate, benzodiazepine and alt a-2 agonist sedation will be chemically reversed, and the animal returned to its group of con-specifics in the immediate vicinity of their capture, with appropriate obseNation. Laboratory animals (mouse models): The goal of these studies is to identify if novel high risk emerging coronaviruses (CoV), filoviruses (FVs) and henipaviruses that circulate in bats and/or other reservoir species are poised for emergence in human populations, and to assess pathogenicity for selected strains of Co Vs, FVs, and henipaviruses. High containment BSL3 and BSL4 pathogens will be recovered from natural infections in reservoir species and/or humans, or recovered from whole genome sequences by reverse genetics using synthetically derived molecular DNA clones. Viruses will be used to infect classic laboratory mouse strains (eg, C57BL6/J), transgenic mice expressing human entry receptors for different coronaviruses, filoviruses or henipaviruses, the Collaborative Cross Genetic Reference populations, or mice reconstituted with the bat immune system designed to identify new mouse models of human disease. Animal experiments with mice will be performed at the University of North Carolina (UNG), Boston National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratory (NEIDL) in dedicated facilities under the direction of the research Pis. Prior to infection studies, the animals will be maintained in Sealsafe TM HEPA-filtered air in/out unit or compatible systems for at least one week prior to virus challenge. In addition, laboratory personnel inspect animals daily and any animal in distress is immediately euthanized (moribund, unresponsive, loss of more than approved percentage of starting weight). Animal care and housing follows IACUC recommendations and all personnel have attended mandatory IACUC training courses. A trained veterinarian is always on call to assist with animal care and husbandry. Below we summarize the description of procedures for each specific Aim, justifications, minimization and pain and distress and methods for euthanasia. Mice Species: Mus musculus; CC mouse lines and knockout mice Ages: Adults 6 to 8 weeks of age and C57BL6 mice of 1.5 years of age Sex: Females and males Procedures for laboratory animals: Animal work will be done at the above-mentioned facilities in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. The minimum numbers of animals will be used in order to achieve our experimental goals with statistical significance. Specific Aim 1: Identify, characterize and rank spillover risk of high zoonotic potential viruses from wildlife. Page 328 Vertebrate AnimalsContact PD/Pl: DASZAK, PETER Rationale: The goal of these studies are to use mouse models to assess human disease for novel viruses discoved in wildlife populations. We note that many zoonotic viruses replicate poorly in rodents, requiring adaptation. To circumvent this problem, we will use genetically distinct mouse resources (CC mice), mouse strains expressing human entry receptors and standard laboratory mice to identify mouse models for studying viral pathogenesis, as well as to evaluate vaccine and antiviral treatment regiments. These studies require tractable experimental model organisms like the CC with sets of defined genetic characteristics (enumerated as follows}. Genetically defined and immortal reference populations that allow whole-organism study of natural variation is a powerful approach for modeling human disease susceptibility and cannot be achieved by means other than the use of whole animal genetics. Mice are excellent model systems to study human gene function for the following reasons: a. The genome has been sequenced and there are many genetic tools available for follow-up and complementary studies. b. Mice share many aspects of anatomy, physiology, patterns of development, and control of gene expression with humans. c. The Collaborative Cross (CC) is a large panel of recombinant inbred strains that have been specifically bred to randomize an extraordinarily large amount of genetic variants and has been designed to be an optimal model of the human heterogeneous population while allowing further probing into tissue and cell�type specific responses d. The CC support integration of data across time, location, demography, and environments. e. Reference populations of mice provide suitable whole-organism models for human viral infection responses, which to date cannot be replicated faithfully by in vitro models. f. The resource is portable and available worldwide. Experimental Design and Sample Sizes: Experiment 1 Mice Twenty mice (1 0 males and 1 0 females) will be infected with six different test viruses/yr. 20 mice x 6 viruses= Total number of mice= Total Animals 120 Experiment 2. 120 mice 120 mice # Pain Category C 100 Humanized Mice C57BL6/J-hACE2 Mice C57BL6/J-hDPP4 288/330 Mice # Pain Category E 20 10 mice (5 female and 5 male} x 4 SARS-like coronaviruses x 2 repeats= 80 mice 1 0 mice (5 female and 5 male} x 4 MERS-like coronaviruses x 2 repeats= 80 mice Total numbers of animals for aim 1 /yr= 160 mice Animal Numbers and Pain Categories Total Animals # Pain Category C 1200 1080 Experiment 3 Mice # Pain Category E 120 Six mice (3 males and 3 females} from 6 Collaborative Cross mouse lines (6 to 8 weeks of age) will be infected with six test viruses/yr.

Specific Aim 2 and 3. Discovery of Novel Viruses from Human Source Samples. We anticipate discovering one novel virus in focal high-risk human populations/yr. Rationale: The goal of these studies are to identify novel mouse models of human disease. We note that newly discovered human viruses replicate poorly in rodents, requiring adaptation. To circumvent this problem, we will use genetically distinct mouse resources (CC mice), mouse strains expressing human entry receptors and standard laboratory mice to identify mouse models for studying viral pathogenesis, as well as to evaluate vaccine and antiviral treatment regiments.

It is anticipated that disease severity will increase in select CC mouse strains. 2. Justify use of animals, choice of species, numbers to be used. Wild animals: Species and number used in study: The purpose of this study is to conduct analyses to geographically- and taxonomically-target testing of samples from wild mammals that are most likely to harbor known high-profile zoonotic pathogens, or close relatives with potential to infect people. We will analyze archived specimens and only collect additional specimens projected from each prioritized taxa to achieve statistically robust sample sizes and to complement our archived specimens. Preliminary analysis indicates that, for all viral target families, we will require ~14,000 new specimens from bats (equating to no more than 7000 individual animals) to identify 80% of remaining bat viral species diversity in our study region, ~5,000 samples from Thailand and ~9,000 samples from Malaysia. Viral strain diversity from a sampling effort this size is expected to number in the hundreds of strains. For example, given ~6% prevalence of CoVs in bat species previously sampled under the PREDICT project, a target of 14,000 individuals would yield ~800 PCR positive individuals, representing, an estimated ~600 novel sequences/strains. Similarly, for PMVs, which have an average PCR detection prevalence of ~ 1.5%, sampling of 14,000 individuals would yield ~200 positives and an estimated 150 novel strains. The required numbers of specimens to capture 80% of CoV and PMV viral diversity in free-ranging rodents and NHP will be approximately half that of bats given lower levels of viral diversity we expect to capture, for a total of no more than 7,000 specimens (equating to no more than 2300 individuals). Filovirus estimates are not feasible yet due to the small number of positive samples in prior studies, but will be estimated as the project begins. Laboratory animals: This proposal aims to develop novel mouse models that display human disease phenotypes following infection with phylogenetically unique zoonotic and human strains of these viruses. These studies cannot be done without vertebrate animals. There is no in vitro system that accurately mimics virulence of highly pathogenic viruses, or be able to predict disease outcomes following infection. At this time, there is no substitute for in vivo efficacy studies. Our studies are designed with the fewest number of animals while retaining statistical significance. The numbers of animals proposed in this study will provide robust statistical confidence of our results. The Collaborative Cross mice are genetically distinct so infection of these mouse strains can result in wildly different clinical disease outcomes. As such, the CC model will identify unique lines that accurately recapitulate many aspects of the human disease phenotypes and will provide essential information for the testing of vaccines and drugs against these highly pathogenic RNA viruses. 3. Provide information on veterinary care. For wild caught animals, veterinary oversight will be provide by EcoHealth Alliance's wildlife veterinarians, led by Senior Veterinarian, Dr. Field. Animals that are injured during the capture or sampling process will be assessed by an experienced team leader, and if the animal is determined to be unlikely to survive if released, it shall be euthanized humanely (see euthanasia section). Animals will be released within hours of capture. The UNC and NEIDL have veterinary staff and team of experienced animal care technicians who will oversee the housing and care of bats used for experimental infections in their facilities. 4. Procedures for ensuring animal comfort, lack of distress, pain, or injury: Wild animals: Wild animals will not be held longer than 6 hours during the sampling process. Co-ls Oliva! and Phelps and Dr. Field from EHA, and co-ls Wacharapluesadee and Hughes (from Thailand and Malaysia, respectively) have extensive experience in capture, anesthesia, and sampling wildlife, especially bats and will lead oversight and training of field teams. In our team's experience, wild animals tolerate the described procedure well. Mist nets will be attended continuously during capture periods, and bats will be extracted from the net as soon as they become entangled. This will minimize stress and injury from entanglement. Bats will be placed individually in cotton bags and hung from tree branches while awaiting processing and during recovery. The bags are sufficiently porous as to allow for ventilation and are designed for bat capture. The enclosed Page 331 Vertebrate AnimalsContact PD/Pl: DASZAK, PETER environment seems to calm the bats, as they do not struggle once inside, but they hang quietly - this is a standard and accepted practice in the bat research world and best way to minimize stress to the animal. Rodent traps will be checked a minimum of twice daily, in the morning and in the afternoon. If adverse weather (extreme heat, rain) is expected or researchers are working in areas where predation is common, traps will be checked more frequently, and closed during the adverse weather. Padding, shelter and food and water will be provided in rodent traps. Animals will be monitored by a veterinarian or experienced field team member during all stages of capture, processing, and release. Animals will be kept in a cool place while in the pillowcases. Laboratory animals: Mouse adapted strains of SARS- and MERS-CoV replicate efficiently in the lungs of mice and may produce significant disease in young and aged animals, including acute onset respiratory distress syndrome, a clinically devastating end stage lung disease with 50% mortality rates. It is unclear whether newly discovered SARS-like or MERS-like coronaviruses or other bat viruses will cause severe disease in mice. Mice will be closely monitored daily for signs of clinical disease. Since analgesics may affect the outcome of infections, analgesics will not be used and we will rely on close monitoring and euthanasia of sick animals to prevent undue pain and suffering. In general, animals will be euthanized if they approach losing >25% of their starting weight; we recognize that this is a significant weight loss, but it is acceptable in these studies as some animals can recover from >25% weight loss after highly pathogenic coronavirus infection. We will euthanize moribund animals, regardless of weight loss criteria. Euthanasia will be performed by overdose with isoflurane. This will immediately be followed by organ harvest/exsanguinations, as prior treatment with these agents ensure that the animals will not suffer during this procedure due to operator error. This approach was chosen because unconsciousness and death occur quickly and the method is consistent with the recommendations of the Panel on Euthanasia of the American Veterinary Medical Association. 5. Euthanasia Wild animals: In the event of injury to a wild animal in the field that results in pain and suffering, and reasonable veterinary care is unavailable, the animal will be euthanized by a veterinarian or trained field team member using ketamine injected intramuscularly 37.Smg/kg and sodium pentobarbital injected intravenously at a dose of 1.0ml per 5kg injected intravenously or intraperitoneally. This protocol is in accordance with the AVMA euthanasia guidelines (2013). Any animal that is euthanized using a chemical agent will be disposed such that it will not be permitted to enter the food supply either through markets or hunting. Criteria for euthanasia for mice: Mice will be euthanized (isoflurane overdose followed by organ harvest) at the point at which they become moribund, lose over 20 percent of their starting weight (or up to 30 percent of their starting weight if the animals are being maintained under the weight loss exception), reach a clinical score of 4 or higher or reach pre-determined endpoints (ranging from 1 to 7 days post infection), whichever comes first. 0. No clinical signs 1. Ruffled fur. 2. Ruffled fur with hunched posture (only slight or no signs of dehydration) 3. As above with more severe signs of dehydration and some loss of body strength, some loss of spontaneous morbidity 4. Marked loss of spontaneous morbidity and pronounced dehydration 5. Moribund: unresponsive to stimuli and pronounced eye squint -All scores except 5 can be qualified with a 0.5 for severity -Any mouse that reaches a clinical score of 4 or more will be euthanized immediately Criteria for euthanasia for bats: Bats will be euthanized (isoflurane overdose followed by organ harvest) at the point at which they become moribund, lose over 20 percent of their starting weight, reach a clinical score of 4 or higher or reach pre-determined endpoints (ranging from 1 to 7 days post infection), whichever comes first. 0. No clinical signs 1. Decreased activity, behavioral abnormalities. 2. Difficulty flying (only slight or no signs of dehydration) Page 332 Vertebrate AnimalsContact PD/Pl: DASZAK, PETER 3.

Moribund: unresponsive to stimuli and pronounced eye squint. -All scores except 5 can be qualified with a 0.5 for severity. -Any bat that reaches a clinical score of 4 or more will be euthanized immediately Page 333 Vertebrate AnimalsContact PD/Pl: DASZAK, PETER SELECT AGENT RESEARCH/BIOHAZARDS. Yes Select Agent Research: Research on Biological Select Agents and Toxins (BSAT) requires strict compliance with regulations that are primarily overseen by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS). These regulations are designed to maintain the safety and security of the materials, personnel and the environment. Per requirements, we outline details of select agent research below for our two EID-SEARCH core laboratory partners, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNG) and National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratories (NEIDL), who will conduct select agent research. Identify the Select Agent(s) to be used in the proposed research: SARS-CoV: We propose using Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-associated Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and SARS-CoV genome RNA (isolated using TriZOL) in this proposal. Derivative viruses encoding 2/3 genome length SARS-CoV are also considered as select agents; consequently, recombinant SARS-CoV encoding various bat SARS-like S glycoproteins will be considered select agents. Henipaviruses: Wildtype Nipah, Hendra and related bat viruses are select agents and will be used at the Boston NEIDL BSL-4 Laboratories. Nipah virus is an overlap select agent regulated by both HHS and USDA. Filoviruses: Wildtype Ebola viruses are select agents and will be used at the Boston N EIDL BSL-4 Laboratories. Provide the registration status of all entities where Select Agent(s) will be used: The UNG is currently registered with the CDC for select agent use including SARS-CoV as required by select agent regulations (42 CFR 73). The UNG SARS select agent laboratories are routinely inspected by the environmental health and safety department at UNG and by the CDC. Workers receive select agent and BSL3 training focused on SARS-CoV safety, procedures and protective clothing/PAPR training each year. The NEIDL Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) group to vet, review and approve Standard Operating Procedures, consistent with BU-wide policies and procedures, which meet and/or exceed all applicable federal, state, and local regulations (NIH, BMBL, OSHA, CDC, NRC, MWRA, DEP, BFD, etc.). EHS responsibilities include: biosafety; laboratory and building occupant safety; wastewater management and monitoring; hazardous and non-hazardous solid waste management; biological, chemical, and radioactive waste disposal management; select agent program, medical surveillance program, staff and first responder training programs. For each NEIDL research project which has been approved by the BU Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC), the EHS Biosafety Manager obtains applicable select agent permits to comply with 7CFR331 and 9CFR121, the Agricultural Bioterrorism Protection act of 2002; Possession, Use, Transfer of Biological Agents and Toxins: Final Rule. If an agent-specific immunization is available the EHS Core Biosafety Manager will assist the Research Occupational Health Program physicians to determine whether laboratory personnel will require immunizations for agents handled or present in the laboratory. Provide a description of all facilities where the Select Agent(s) will be used: UNC: SARS-CoV and related derivative viruses will be manipulated in research activities (UNG) including establishing growth curves and performing plaque assays in laboratory spaces that meet the operational and procedural criteria for BSL-3 activities as outlined in the CDC/NIH "Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories", 5th edition, as well as the BL-3 criteria outlined in the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules (March 2013). In addition, all mouse work at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill will be performed in the approved and registered BSL-3 lab, equipped with Techniplast SealsaferM Hepa-filtered animal housing for rodents. All protocols will be approved by the IACUC at the University of North Carolina at Chapel. At UNC, all BSL-3/ABSL-3/select agent laboratories are equipped with biosafety cabinets, incubators, centrifuges with containment features, cold storage units, an autoclave, sink, eyewash and life safety equipment, as well as mechanical system monitors and alarms to support effective isolation and containment of operations Page 334 Select Agent ResearchContact PD/Pl: DASZAK, PETER involving SARS-CoV. The anterooms to the BSL-3 labs house PAPR charging stations, lab and safety supplies, and a changing area. For both the BSL2 and BSL3 select agent spaces, access to the select agents is restricted by the hallway to anteroom door, which requires swipe card and punch codes for entry, the door between the anteroom and the BSL-3 (BL3 only), and freezer locks. NEIDL: The select agent work to be carried out will be performed in the National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratories (NEIDL). The NEIDL is fully permitted for Select Agent work at BSL-3 and ABSL-3, as well as BSL-4 and ABSL-4. We will conduct experimental infection studies using Nipah and Hendra (Henipaviruses) and Ebola and Ebola-related viruses at NEIDL using animal models and cell lines within the biosafety level 4 laboratory at NEIDL. No infectious materials will be moved or handled outside of the BSL 4 facility. All science and animal care staff are fully trained and certified to work under BSL 4 conditions. At Boston University (BU), research with BSAT is focused to combat infectious diseases caused by the agents, with primary concentration on the development of vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostic tests. Work is conducted in highly specialized containment facilities that are specifically designed, verified and maintained to ensure that the materials are secured, contained and handled safely. Research facilities with BSA Tat BU have received prior approval from CDC/USDA and other local regulatory agencies prior to the possession, storage and conducting of research work. All BSAT research proposals are first carefully reviewed by the Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) and, together with the Environmental Health and Safety (EHS), checks and verifies that the required safety procedures, personal protective equipment, safety equipment, and trainings are in place and implemented prior to initiation of research work. A senior Scientific Safety Officer serves as the Select Agent Responsible Official (RO) and has oversight for the implementation of the BSAT program. Under this program, the institution implements and maintains a system of control measures to ensure that all personnel are properly screened for security risks and have passed the required background verification checks by Federal agencies and BU. Personnel complete and meet the medical and health screenings required by the Research Occupational Health Program (ROHP); personnel are appropriately trained on the hazards of the materials, safety procedures and their roles and responsibilities. The RO and the Alternate Responsible Officials (ARO) conduct an annual review of the Security, Biosafety and Incident Response Plans and make necessary changes to the plans. Describe the procedures that will be used to monitor possession, use and transfer of the Select Agent(s): All personnel who will have access to select agent-regulated materials have been added to the select agent registration following security risk assessments prescribed by the CDC Select Agent Program. Personnel have completed training in all aspects of select agent compliance requirements and have adopted changes to standard operating procedures as applicable to assure that these requirements are met. Personnel will follow all procedures prescribed for accessing and securing the lab, documenting lab activities and materials used, and responding to incidents that could result in theft, loss or release of select agent regulated materials. Transfers of select agent-regulated materials will be coordinated by the Lab Manager and Responsible Official in accordance with standard operating procedure, including obtaining appropriate permits for shipping select agent materials. Lab managers of both facilities are DOT/IATA trained for shipping dangerous goods and will follow all regulations for shipping, both under dangerous goods and select agent regulations. Transfer of select agent RNA in trizol from the BSL3 and BSL2 laboratory is witnessed by UNC and Vanderbilt ARO in a process that has been approved by the CDC. For NEIDL, all biohazards that are shipped or received for approved projects are mandated to meet the standards of the High Hazard Materials Management policy, which states that BU will meet or exceed all applicable shipping regulations under the requirements of the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) and the International Air Transportation Authority (IATA). The RO, the BU Office of Emergency Management and Public Safety have responsibility for overseeing the transportation process for select agents and for contracting appropriate transportation vendors which utilize screened personnel, GPS tracking systems and can provide an all-inclusive chain of custody documentation for each shipment. Describe plans for appropriate biosafety, biocontainment, and security of the Select Agent(s): Co-I Baric's Page 335 Select Agent ResearchContact PD/Pl: DASZAK, PETER laboratories have been operational since 2004 with BSL-3 Core Policies and Procedures documentation in place with lab-specific standard operating procedures. BSL-3 standard operating procedures have been reviewed and approved by the Institutional Biosafety Committees at either the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill or Vanderbilt and are updated as lab processes change or biosafety procedures evolve. The content of these documents has been reformatted and expanded to conform to the select agent regulations for the biosafety, security and incident response plans. Additionally, lab-specific security risk assessments have been completed and recommendations put in place to ensure that security measures and procedures are sufficient to effectively minimize the possibility of unauthorized access to select agent-regulated materials. Equipment and procedures will be modified if deemed necessary based on this assessment. The facilities at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Vanderbilt have undergone multiple CDC inspections and are currently in compliance with CDC requirements relating to SARS-CoV and select agent status. Co-ls Keusch and Corley from NEIDL have endorsed a "safety first" environment which underpin all activities. The NEIDL Public Safety core is responsible for 24 hours a day, 7 days a week facility security and both police-academy highly trained public safety officers and specialized automated building systems are used. Public Safety personnel are well trained in the intricacies of a secure site maintenance, criminal applications with a significant amount of training pertaining to safety, facilities, emergency preparedness and response, biosafety incidents, animal rights activism, insider threats and coordinated notification and response of external local, state and federal responders. Individuals are only granted access to relevant NEIDL facilities based upon their responsibilities in the building. Employees pass through security layers that require identification by a public safety officer, and use a combination of proximity card access and biometric iris readers to gain access to laboratories in which select agent work is carried out. Activities in select agent laboratories can be monitored by closed circuit television, and video recordings can be reviewed. Access is monitored for compliance both electronically and by public safety staff. Variances to authorized access results in notifications of public safety staff within the building which will initiate a response to that variance. Describe the biocontainment resources available at all performance sites: All BSL-3 and BSL-4 labs are under negative pressure, with redundant systems to ensure negative pressure is maintained. Both facilities have autoclaves to decontaminate all waste materials as well as approved protocols for the treatment or inactivation of any materials leaving the lab. All personnel are extensively trained in basic virology and safety protocols before being approved for select agent work and then undergo extensive training to work with SARS-CoV as a BSL-3 pathogen. In both labs, annual testing is performed to verify that the biosafety cabinets, lab supply/exhaust systems (including alarms), and other laboratory equipment are functioning as designed. The lab is secured at all times and only personnel who have successfully completed select agent clearance and laboratory specific training requirements are permitted to enter without an escort. OTHER BIOHAZADS Other Biohazards and Non-Select BSL3 Agents: We will synthesize full length recombinant viruses for MERS-CoV and from a variety of SARS-like, ME RS-like and related emerging coronaviruses (e.g., SADS-CoV, HKU2, HKU10, etc.). All of these viruses will be isolated and studied under BSL3 conditions at UNC. Field Work Biosafety: Introduction and Background. Many of the novel viruses studied in this proposal have caused or have the potential to cause human outbreaks with significant case fatality rates, and there are no vaccines available for many of these agents. The work proposed in this application will involve two aspects: field work and laboratory work, focusing on distantly coronaviruses, filoviruses and henipaviruses. Fieldwork involves the highest risk of exposure to bat and related human viruses of high pathogenic potential, while working in caves with high bat density overhead and the potential for fecal dust to be inhaled. There is also some risk of exposure to pathogens or physical injury while handling bats, rodents, primates or other animals, their blood samples or their excreta. The Co-Pis and field team have extensive experience and certification working with wildlife species and high-biosecurity pathogens (Nipah virus, ebolavirus, SARS-like CoV, MERS-like CoV etc.), and great care will be taken in the field to limit the risk of accidental exposure to known or unknown animal pathogens. We have strict procedures Page 336 Select Agent ResearchContact PD/Pl: DASZAK, PETER for handling bats and working with samples from them as they are secured in the field and transported to the lab. Field team members handling animals will be trained to utilize personal protective equipment and practice proper environmental disinfection techniques. This includes wearing coveralls or dedicated clothing, nitrile gloves, eye protection, and a P95 or P100 respirator, or positive air pressure respirators (PAPRs) in the field. All field clothing and equipment will be disinfected using Virkon disinfectant, and Tyvek suits will be properly disposed of as biohazard. All biological waste from field surveys will be disposed of in the appropriate container (sharps box or an autoclave bag) and will be autoclaved at local hospitals or university labs. All personnel will be vaccinated against rabies and have a neutralizing antibody titer, in accordance with WHO and CDC recommendations. Field teams will carry rabies boosters in the field and will receive a booster in the event of a potential rabies exposure. Field safety protocol: Our procedures to deal with bites, needle-sticks etc. are as follows: The wound is washed thoroughly with soap and water to clean away dirt and debris, then vigorously scrubbed with a sterile gauze bandage and benzalkonium chloride for 5 minutes. If bleeding, pressure is applied with a sterile bandage for until bleeding has stopped. If the wound continues to bleed, medical attention at the nearest hospital is sought. The bat from which the bite or exposure originated is identified, and the samples collected from it labeled on the data sheet that these were involved in an exposure. Our procedures require that the person potentially exposed reports to a major hospital within 24 hours to have wound examined and receive a rabies booster as per WHO/CDC protocols. The laboratory work is lower risk, as samples placed in lysis buffer will be non-infectious. Samples placed in viral transport medium and frozen will be stored at ultra-low temperatures (-86°C) until viral isolation is required. Serum will be heat inactivated at 56°C for 30 minutes prior to testing. Available Treatments: No approved treatments are related for MERS-CoV, MEAS-like bat CoV, SAAS and the SARSr-related and other bat coronavirus infections, however, GS5734 is effective against most coronaviruses, filoviruses and henipaviruses. In addition, therapeutic human antibodies are available against many of the classic high path viruses studied in this proposal, although it is less certain whether these immunotherapeutics will be effective against more phylogenetically distant strains in the family. VSV-EBOV vaccine is used to prevent Ebola infections in humans, having been administered to over 130,000 humans, mostly in the DRC. P3CO Research. Recognizing the implementation of new gain of function research guidelines under P3CO, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are subject to these guidelines, and as such, reverse genetic studies are subject to review. Our group has considerable expertise in interfacing with the appropriate NIH P3CO institutional review boards to review, revise and finalize research designs that have the potential to modify pathogenesis or transmissibility in mammals.

We at NEIDL have collaborated successfully with all partners on this proposal, and look forward to continuing our work together. Going from "sequences" to "viruses" is a critical unmet need in surveillance and in assessing spillover potential and we are happy to participate. We are particularly excited about the opportunities to have access to sequences of novel viruses that may need to have 3' or 5' ends "completed", as well as to assess the presence of viruses in samples that are PCR positive for isolation and culture under BSL-4 conditions. We will seek external funding to test these for infectivity in human cells, and make these available to other investigators in the USA. We have a number of investigators that are experienced working with pathogens at maximum containment, have the ability to test viruses for infectivity in a variety of human cell types, and to assess the uptake and receptor usage in these cells. We are already developing small molecule and monoclonal therapeutics with commercial partners, and also hope to receive convalescent sera, PBMCs and other samples from clinical cohorts to further these goals. Finally, we will actively take part in technology transfer and research cross-training with other partners, including externally-funded visiting scholars and are ready, willing and able to work in surge capacity to conduct research during outbreak situations, in collaboration with all other EIDRCs and the EIDRC CC.

CDC has a long history of collaboration with government organizations, non-governmental organizations, academic institutions including success with the NIH-funded research activities. I believe that CDC's work in Southeast Asia, through CDC-SARO, provides an effective platform to successfully collaborate with you on the proposed "Understanding Risk of Zoonotic Virus Emergence in EID Hotspots of Southeast Asia" project. I understand that the overall goal of this proposed study is to further understand an important group of emerging zoonotic viruses that threaten global health security. The mission of CDC's global health presence is to protect Americans and people worldwide from public health threats by working with partners to build capacity, advance research, and respond in times of crises. This project will advance CDC's global mission by improving our knowledge of the zoonotic epidemiology of potentially highly�pathogenic emerging viruses, understanding the characteristics of these viruses that may be associated with increased potential for spill over and/or pathogenesis in humans, as well as improving our ability to detect and diagnose these unique pathogens. The emergence of Nipah virus in Malaysia, SARS-CoV, zoonotic influenza viruses (H5Nl, H7N9) MERS-CoV, Zika, and finally Ebola in West Africa demonstrates the zoonotic potential of these and other viruses and highlights the critical gaps in knowledge including well-characterized diagnostics and medical countermeasures to stop these public health threats .. Furthermore, the spread of these outbreaks across international borders provides clear evidence of mobility of these pathogens given current trade/movement of animals and extensive networks of international travel. Should you be successful with your application, CDC SARO is willing to provide technical support, liaise regional Ministries and CDC country offices, and provide general assistance as needed to advance the proposed science. 31<1.5th floor, Building 7, Department of Disease Control, Ministry of Public Health.

As you know, I have long experience with both government and university sectors in researching wildlife�associated EIDs including henipaviruses, coronaviruses and filoviruses in Southeast Asia and China. As an Honorary Professor in the School of Veterinary Science at UQ, the mutual benefits to be gained through research cooperation and partnership in this project, including sharing of technology, samples, reagents, data and research results, are clearly evident. The proposed research will undoubtedly advance our understanding of the ability of wildlife-origin coronaviruses, henipaviruses and filoviruses to spillover into high-risk human populations and cause morbidity and mortality previously unreported or undiagnosed. The results will be scientifically important, and have direct and significant public health value both regionally and globally, by identifying key pandemic threats in an EID hotspot region. I very much look forward to participating in this new initiative with previous partners with a proven track record in this field. My contribution will include expert input in relevant study design, data collection and analysis, partner meetings, and dissemination and publication, and more broadly, technology transfer and research cross-training with other partners, as well as contribute surge capacity to undertake research during outbreak situations, in collaboration with all other EIDRCs and the EIDCC. Yours sincerely, Dr. Hume Field BVSc MSc PhD MACVS Honorary Professor The University of Queensland I School of Veterinary Science Brisbane, Australia (b)(6) Page 370 Letters of SupportContact PD/Pl: DASZAK, PETER RESOURCE SHARING PLAN To share resources with the academic research community, we will use the uniform Material Transfer Agreement (MTA), which acknowledges that the materials are proprietary to Institutions of the Cooperative Agreement and permitting their use in a manner that is consistent with the Bayh-Dole Act and NIH funding requirements. NIH research grants require that research be made available to the scientific community and public. The primary method of data sharing is through peer-reviewed publications in scientific journals and by presentation at scientific meetings. In addition, data and results created from NIH supported research will be submitted to NIH in annual progress reports per the terms and conditions of this award. Recombinant viruses, transgenic mouse models and experimental recombinant protein constructs will be made available upon request following a standard procedure (below). Several viruses isolated and studied in this program are select agents so these viruses will not be shipped unless appropriate documentation demonstrates the existence of approved BSL3/4 facilities, select agent licenses, and shipment using approved CDC and Department of Commerce procedures. We already have established MTAs between most of our EID-SEARCH, consortium partners and will ensure these agreements are up to date and agreed upon by our consortium at the start of our project and then reviewed annually. Having these agreements in place will further reduce the time needed to share reagents and other resources in the event of an outbreak when time-sensitive sharing of biological resources and diagnostic reagents is most critical. At the start of the project, we will work with the EIDRC - Coordinating Center to ensure these agreements and resource sharing plans are compliant and aligned with plans created for NIH's other EIDRCs. Data Sharing Plan EcoHealth Alliance (EHA) will house the Data Management and Analysis (DMA) team for EIDRC SEARCH, led by Co-Pis Olival and Zambrana-Toreillo and include Key Personnel Latinne and Mendelsohn. EHA has served as the data and analysis hub for numerous multi-institutional, multi-sectoral, international disease research groups, including acting as the Modeling and Analytics lead institution for the USAID-PREDICT project, the Western Asia Bat Research Network lead by co-I Olival ( 1) and EHA's Rift Valley Fever Consortium (2). We will leverage our experience and infrastructure from those projects. Project Database: We will create a dedicated, centralized EIDRC database to ingest, store, link, and provide for analysis all data associated with the proposed study and other expanded projects associated with the research network. The database will be SOL-based and use encrypted, secure cloud hosting services and enable export to archival and platform-independent formats. It will ensure data and metadata compatibility between project components, track data versioning and annotations. The system will be designed to work with both with both paper- and tablet-based field data entry and with laboratory information management systems in place in individual partner labs. We will design and engineer the systems to be compatible with other NIAID approved data management systems, including those utilized by the EIDRC-CC, by designing secure APls, and matching data fields and data standards. The database will use existing metadata standards, including NCBI standards for genetic and molecular data and Ecological Metadata Language (EML) for field and wildlife data, as well as other standards and formats designated by the EIRDC CC. This will enable rapid publication and deposition of data. Granular security and privacy controls will be applied so that specific expansion projects undertaken in the network may be managed while maintaining data confidentiality as needed. Data Identification and Privacy: For human clinical data and questionnaires, data will be identified by a unique identification code assigned to each individual and only this, de-identified code will be accessible in the project database. All questionnaire data and biological samples will be labeled with a unique alphanumeric identification code, assigned to each enrolled, sampled individual that does not identify the individual from whom data are collected. Participants' names and codes, along with other records with identifying information such as informed consent forms, will be stored in a separately secure system accessible to only essential project staff. If participants agree during the consent process, they may be contacted about having their samples or questionnaire data used for future separate studies about new animal infections discovered in the Page 371 Resource Sharing Plan(s)Contact PD/Pl: DASZAK, PETER future, and factors that may affect their chances of getting these animal infections. No data will be released for other purposes without full consent from participants. Upon completion of the project, personal identifying information will be destroyed unless this protocol is extended. Training: Members of the OMA team will team will develop documentation and provide training for field and laboratory teams at all partner institutions in data management, metadata standards and data hygiene best practices. The OMA team will act as trainers and consultants for partner institutions in experimental design, power analysis, data analysis, and computational and reproducibility issues. OMA trainers will visit each partner institution and/or field team base for training workshops and analysis consultations, and partner institution researchers and students will spend extended time at EHA for collaborative analysis, a model that has been successful in building and maintaining analytical capacity under our NSF EcoHealthNet and PREDICT programs. Computing Resources: EHA operates a cluster of high-performance servers (System76 20- and 36-core Linux servers with NVIDIA deep-learning GPUs), for data analysis activities, as well as infrastructure to launch cloud�based computing environments of virtual machine with identical software infrastructure. Our servers provide a web-based analysis environment with all necessary software for statistical and bioninformatics work that is available to the OMA and partners anywhere in the world. We use a mixture of cloud services (AWS, Azure, Backblaze, GitHub) to provide redundancy, backup, version control, and rapid post-disaster recovery. The cluster is available to all project partners and can be used use for both high-performance and training-level work (under isolated environments for security and performance). Data and Code Sharing: Data will be available to the public and researchers without cost or registration, and be released under a CC0 license, as soon as related publications are in press. Data will be deposited for in long-term public scientific repositories. All sequence data will be made publicly available via GenBank. Additional ecological data collected in wildlife sampling will be deposited to the Knowledge Network for Biodiversity, and other data will be deposited in appropriate topic-specific or general repositories. Computer code for modeling and statistical analysis will be made available on a code-hosting site (GitHub), and archived in the Zenodo repository under an open-source, unrestrictive MIT license. Limited human survey and clinical data will be released following anonymization and aggregation per IRB requirements. Publications will be released as open-access via deposition to PubMed commons. Sharing Model Organisms Within the program, we will utilize standard laboratory mice as well as different Collaborative Cross mouse strains as well as various transgenic mouse strains, several of which are already available at the NIH-supported Mutant Mouse Regional Resource Center (MMMRC) at UNG. The Collaborative Cross mice are already publicly available from the UNG Systems Genetics Core Facility and the Jackson laboratories, and as such available to the scientific community. All genotyping information generated on these populations will be deposited in the appropriate public repositories (e.g. GEO, lmmPort, ENA). Similarly, all phenotypic data generated within this program from studies with mice will be deposited in the Mouse Phenome Database upon publication, as well as lmmPort to ensure dissemination to the community at large. In accordance with the NIH/NIAID data sharing and release guidelines, we will coordinate the rapid and unrestricted sharing of all data generated as part of this project. 1. Genotypes generated on the MUGA mouse array, including raw x- and y- intensity data and derived genotype calls will be made available for download from the Mutant Mouse Regional Resource Center at UNC's website (https://www.med.unc.edu/mmrrc/genotypes/publications) and at Zenodo (https://zenodo.org/). Reagent Sharing For all other reagents/requests, we have established a consistent process for evaluating requests for samples and reagents from outside scientists. In order of priority, these include: 1) requests for reagents that have been Page 372 Resource Sharing Plan(s)Contact PD/Pl: DASZAK, PETER published in peer-reviewed journals; 2) requests which enhance/promote a specific agenda of the program projects and f acuity; 3) requests that promote scientifically valid collaborations between project faculty and outside scientists; and 4) overall research and public health needs. The general format involves: a) establishing a working knowledge of the research agenda and credentials of the requestor, b) group discussion and agreement, 3) MTA agreement with the appropriate institution, or license agreement with a commercial entity, and 4) inventory checking and sending out of reagents. We will work closely with the appropriate institutional Technology Transfer Office and individuals involved in these transactions. The goal will be to provide reagents within a few months of receiving a request for traditional research purposes. In the event of an outbreak or emergency situation, we will communicate with the NIH and EIDRC-CC, and rapidly speed up resource sharing among our EID-SEARCH core partners and our extended network. As documented in the Research Strategy, EHA has successfully provided rapid technical assistance for testing and reagent needs during outbreaks under the USAID-PREDICT proiect, and has strong existing relationships and existing MTAs with our core EID�SEARCH partners to facilitate this. If needed, we will also acquire appropriate letters from the recipient institutions environmental health and safety officers and help coordinate CDC and/or USDA and Department of Commerce permits. The program faculty will not send reagents to individuals or institutions that do not have appropriate documentation of appropriate containment for the materials, might harbor ill-intentions, or are conducting irresponsible research. Genomic Data Sharing We will ensure compliance with NIH's Genomic Data Sharing plans for all viral sequence data generated in this project. We anticipate obtaining genetic sequence data for 100s of novel virus genotypes, including RNA�dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) sequences for all strains/genotypes and sequences of viral attachment glycoproteins. We will generate full viral genomes for a subset of the viruses and human virus strains that we identify. We will also generate host genetic sequence data for relevant cellular receptor genes of wildlife species. We will deposit all genetic sequences in the NIH data bank, NCBI GenBank as soon as possible after data are generated (including ensurance of quality control), and no later than 6 months, so that they are readily available to the scientific community. We will ensure that all meta-data associated with these sequences, including collection locality lat/long, species-level host identification, date of collection, and sequencing protocols will also submitted. We anticipate sequence generation will occur over the 5 year proposed project period. All datasets and associated meta-data will be additionally submitted to Virus Pathogen Resource (Vi PR, http://www.viprbrc.org). All computational models of biological processes will be made available on the BioModels Database (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels-main/). Intellectual Property Intellectual property agreements, identified during the course of this project, will be accomplished by negotiation in good faith among the institutions and inventors. We will work with the inventors in the production of the necessary documents, working with the particular institutions, legal firms and commercial interests. It is anticipated that companies and institutions will have access to these reagents and viruses by MTA (for research purposes) or by a license agreement to be negotiated in good faith with a company.

Page 373 Resource Sharing Plan(s)Contact PD/Pl: DASZAK, PETER AUTHENTICATION OF KEY BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES AND SCIENTIFIC RIGOR Eco Health Alliance will actively engage with each partner laboratory to ensure that the highest quality of science, public accountability, and social responsibility in the conduct of science is maintained throughout this project. The overall goal is to ensure that the underlying scientific foundation of research conducted under our EID-SEARCH project from conception to completion is scientifically sound. The application is designed to ensure rigor, by using a robust and unbiased experimental design, well defined methodology, large group sizes that ensures statistical rigor and analysis, clearly interpretable endpoints, biological authentication of key biological resources and transparency in the reporting of results. To ensure scientific rigor (e.g., determining group sizes, analyzing anticipated results, reducing bias, ensuring independent and blinded measurements, improving precision and reducing variability including or excluding research subjects, and managing missing data), EcoHealth Alliance will review scientific approaches and statistical justification of study design throughout the duration of the award. We have highlighted our statistical approach to analysis of animal and human data in our Research Strategy and accompanying Statistical Analysis Plan. Whenever possible, multiple experimental approaches are used to demonstrate congruency in data interpretation. We will ensure that experimental designs will include considerations of sex as a "Relevant Biological Variable" in al I studies involving human subjects or vertebrate animals. Unless otherwise specified and justified, all sampling and screening will include male and females. Details below ensure the authentication of key biological resources needed for further biological characterization of viruses in the laboratories of the University of North Carolina, Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore, and National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratories (NEIDL), Boston (Aim 1) as well as authentication of key reagents needed for molecular and serological screening, particularly the multiplex microsphere immunoassay (MMIA) or Luminex assay reagents developed by Uniformed Services University, Bethesda (Aims 2 and 3). Cell lines. We will purchase cell lines from commercial vendors (e.g., ATCC), which confirm the authentication of the cells they supply using short tandem repeat (STR) profiling (ATCC). For all cell lines, we will create a low�passage (<5 passages) working stock for use across all experiments, and while in use, we will monitor morphology and growth kinetics continuously and perform mycoplasma tests monthly. If cultures exhibit unexpected changes in growth or morphology or test positive for mycoplasma, we will discard them immediately. All genetically modified cell lines will be frozen at low passage and maintained in culture only for 10 passage cycles. Once thawed and placed in culture, each cell line will be re-evaluated for maintenance of gene targeting. Primary cells. Early passage primary lung cells from humans are a key reagent for the proposed studies, including airway epithelial cells and microvascular endothelial cells. Human cells are derived from donors of both sexes and from all ages and ethnic groups and are provided from deidentified donors from the cystic fibrosis center tissue procurement fee for service center (https://www.med.unc.edu/marsicolunginstitute/core�facilities/tissueprocurmentandcellculturecore/). Care is taken during cell isolation to only handle one human organ at a time. Similarly, primary cell populations are handled carefully, only one donor cell type from a single donor at a time to avoid any mixing. The cells are observed to exhibit well-described prototypical characteristics of human primary lung cells in cell type specific medias in culture. For quality control, the cells are cultured in antibiotic free media to test for bacterial and fungal microbial contamination and are subjected to mycoplasma testing. Once the epithelial cells are grown as polarized and differentiated monolayers, a representative sample is subject to quality control histological analysis of cell morphology and Short Terminal Repeat (STR) marker profiling by the UNC Lineberger Cancer Center's Tissue Culture Facility (TCF). The Freestyle™ 293-F cell line is used for the development and expression of the viral recombinant proteins. These cells are from Thermo-Fisher Scientific, Inc., and are adapted to suspension culture in Freestyle™ 293 Expression Medi um. Luminex (MMIA) Serological Reagents. To improve CoV-specific antibody detection, we propose to develop a multiplex microsphere immunoassay (MMIA) to enable serum samples to simultaneously be tested for antibodies reactive to the trimeric S, monomeric S1 and S2 subunits, and N. This assay development, being led by Uniformed Services University (USU), will involve some non-standard biological and chemical resources that Page 374 Authentication of Key Biological and/or Chemical ResourcesContact PD/Pl: DASZAK, PETER require validation and authentication. USU has specialized strategies to oversee the authentication of key biological resources, reagents and chemical resources during assay development and validation. Each purified protein antigen will be tested by protein gel and Western blot analysis to confirm expected protein size and weight. Polyclonal rabbit antisera specific to each purified antigen will be generated and used to test size exclusion and affinity purified proteins with Luminex-based platform. These polyclonal rabbit antisera will act as positive and negative controls for each purified protein and will be used to quantify inter and intra assay variation as well as ensure that each batch of purified protein retains the same level of assay reactivity. This positive and negative control assay standardization will be transferred to both international partner laboratories (JUST, Lugar) and guidelines detailing monthly testing will be included as part of the in-country training. Assay control results between USU and implementing laboratories in Thailand and Malaysia will be compared throughout the project to identify and control of any user or assay errors at each site. Plasmids. We will sequence all cloned genes after their generation, after each PCR amplification, and after other modifications (such as site-directed mutagenesis). All molecular clones will be synthesized using commercial vendors and sequence verified after receipt. All mutations will be verified prior to assembly of full length clones for recombinant virus recover, which includes SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, SARS-like and ME RS-like CoV, select bat coronaviruses, Ebola and Ebola related filoviruses, Marburg and Marburg related filoviruses, and henipaviruses (Nipah, Hendra and related viruses). Viruses. We will sequence wildtype and recombinant virus stocks to confirm the absence of unwanted mutations. For experiments in mice, each stock of live virus is deep-sequenced to confirm its authenticity, tested for the absence of mycoplasma, and tested for its lethality in animal models. Animal Models. We will breed wild-type (WT) C57BU6J, Collaborative Cross (CC) Recombinant Inbred Mice, and various transgenic C57BL6/J mice expressing the hACE2 receptor and humanized C57BI6/J 288/330+1+ DPP4 mice, which can be used to evaluate pathogenic outcomes following SARS-CoV, bat SARSr-CoV and MERS-CoV and bat MERSr-CoV. Animals will be used at UNC and Duke-NUS or will be shipped to the NEIDL in Boston Biosafety Level 4 (BSL-4) facility for experiments with authentic Ebola, related filoviruses and various henipaviruses. We obtained founder mice for the WT C57BU6J colony from Jackson Laboratories, which confirms the authenticity of the animals they supply, while all CC mice were obtained from the University of North Carolina CC genetic reference population (https://csbio.unc.edu/CCstatus/index.py). For assay development at USU, polyclonal rabbit sera specific to the recombinant viral glycoprotein to be generated will be prepared by Noble Life Sciences Inc., Maryland; a fee-for-service and AAALAC accredited, OLAW assured, and USDA licensed company with over 50 years of experience in animal housing and husbandry for large and small animals. Mouse strain Genetic Validation. Inbred mouse strains and Collaborative Cross Mice are an invaluable tool for biomedical research, and represent a key aspect of this entire program. To ensure that the genetic background of all mice used within this program is known and when applicable they are part of a known inbred strains, we will genotype each mouse strain used within this program on the appropriate MUGA platform (Morgan, AP et.al., G3 2016, Dec 18). The most recent iteration of this state of the art genotyping array contains over 140,000 markers and can be used to precisely determine the genetic background at the substrain level and the precise location (at <1 megabase resolution) of genomic regions derived from different mouse inbred strains. In this way, the identity and genomic integrity of all mice used within these studies will be ensured. As new diagnostic assays become available, we will assess their utility and the cost effectiveness of the different MUGA arrays and implement them as appropriate. Furthermore, for each mutant mouse strain used within the project, positive diagnoses of the mutation will be assessed for each cohort of experimental animals with a diagnostic validated PCR assay or Sanger sequencing diagnostic to ensure proper results. Mice with novel and interesting phenotypes after infection with different program viruses of interest will be deposited at the MMRRC housed at the University of North Carolina. The MMRRC is the nation's premier national public repository system for mutant mice. Funded by the NIH continuously since 1999, the MMRRC Page 375 Authentication of Key Biological and/or Chemical ResourcesContact PD/Pl: DASZAK, PETER archives and distributes scientifically valuable spontaneous and induced mutant mouse strains and ES cell lines for use by the biomedical research community. The University of North Carolina is one of the 4 major academic MMRRC centers across the nation. Genome Sequencing. All PCR assays will be performed using appropriate control materials. Synthetic DNA constructs will be designed and used as universal controls. These DNA plasmids will contain short regions of overlapping viral sequences that act as primer binding sites for different PCR assays. The sequence spanning any two primers binding regions will be unique, allowing for contamination to be readily identified. Contamination control PCR will be used to rule out the possibility of contamination in a sample with universal control when a positive PCR result is obtained. All DNA sequence reads obtained from PCR screening of wildlife and human specimens will be examined by bioinformatic leads in each partner laboratory upon generation and again upon integration into our database system, for completeness, accuracy, and logical consistency. When base calls are uncertain, chromatograms will be reviewed to resolve ambiguities; and cloning and re-sequencing of samples if disagreement is observed. Once all test results (e.g., initial detection by PCR and subsequent sequencing of viruses) are available for a given specimen, the results are interpreted in light of all available and up-to-date scientific literature and previous findings by experienced EID-SEARCH virologists and bioinformaticians. This iterative process ensures the highest quality, most robust, data possible. We will ensure completeness of all existing metadata, meeting NCBI standards for genetic and molecular data. For authentication of whole genome sequencing using next generation sequencing methods, we will ensure standard QC metrics are met at all points in the process of data generation, including: 1) sample quality control - validation of nucleic acid quality using spectrophotometric methods; 2) QC on base read quality and sequence reads through analysis of quality scores (Q scores); 3) standard methods to ensure quality of assembled/aligned reads by using NCBI and ICTV recognized viral reference sequences. Following details in our Genomic Data Sharing plans, we will deposit all genetic sequences in the NIH data bank, NCBI GenBank as soon as possible after quality control process is completed, and no later than 6 months after data have been generated, so that they are readily available to the scientific community. All datasets and associated meta-data will be additionally submitted to Virus Pathogen Resource (Vi PR, http://www.viprbrc.org) where they can be further authenticated by the scientific research community. Intellectual Property. Intellectual property agreements, identified during the course of this project, will be accomplished by negotiation in good faith among the institutions and inventors.
