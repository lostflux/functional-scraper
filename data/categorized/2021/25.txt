Major General Vitaly Gerasimov was killed in fighting near Kharkiv, according to the Ukrainian military intelligence agency – although the death has not been independently confirmed.

Mr Grozev added: “Thus the phone call using a local sim card. Thus the intercept.”James Rands of Janes, a trusted defence intelligence agency, said Russia introduced a new encrypted telephone system called Era after becoming concerned about communications security.
Posing one theory of what might have gone wrong, he said: “What radio hams are finding is that really sensitive messages like an FSB officer calling his superior to say General Gerasimov had been killed are being sent in clear because the officers involved explicitly say Era doesn’t work.
“The leading explanation is that Era required 3G or 4G to work and the Russian Army has been destroying those masts as they advance ensuring they cannot use their own secure comms.
“It may also be [that Era is] quite new, it’s just not actually working yet.” The destruction of phone masts in Ukraine remains anecdotal at present. If true, it could mean certain devices work while others are out of action.
Bellingcat appeared to corroborate this theory, saying Russians “tried to use the Era cryptophones in Kharkiv, after destroying many 3G cell towers and also replacing others with stingrays. Era needs 3G/4G to communicate.”“The Russian army is equipped with secure phones that can’t work in areas where the Russian army operates.”Assuming the call about Mr Gerasimov is real, Mr Rands said “then it sounds like they definitely knew they were talking on an unencrypted line and they could be listened in to”.

There have also been reports of fighters buying commercial, off-the-shelf kit for communications. “That’s not surprising if a lot of their radios are just old and knackered,” said Mr Rands.
Other reports suggest Russian forces are using older analog radios that do not have crypto (the electronic code which encrypts messages) stored within the machine.
Mr Rands said: “The Russian Army is a tiered army. The Spetsnaz, at the very top, get whatever they want pretty much and a tier below them are the VDV who get very nearly everything, encrypted radios, night vision equipment, modern body armour.
“Then you move down to the lower tier troops. Any unit with Guards in their name tends to be highly regarded but the rest are seen as pretty basic and a low priority for new kit and equipment.
“There’s a very clear [distinction] between funding for the Eastern Military District (EMB) and the Western Military District… It’s troops from the EMB who established positions in Belarus and who probably make up the bulk of the troops in the convoy north of Kyiv… so it would make sense if that force in particular didn’t have modern radios.”However, the Russians should still have access to other means of encrypting older devices, said Mr Rands.
“The Russians must have something… in their store cupboards and they will have electronic encryption. It looks like this just wasn’t distributed beforehand.
“We seem to have seen a general failure to plan for any contingencies other than a lightning fast victory. Communications planning seems to mirror logistics planning in that it was inadequate and so when thousands of vehicles started moving forward they did so without a comms plan.”Dr James Bosbotinis, an independent specialist in defence and international affairs, said: “The fact that the Russians are using unencrypted comms does not bode well for command and control (C2).
“With flawed C2, unencrypted/insecure comms, high-ranking commanders are having to go to the frontline to try to resolve issues, which in turn exposes them to risk and getting killed.
“The use of local sim cards/mobile phone services also sheds light on another aspect of the Russian operation, that is, their failure to utilise the full spectrum of electronic warfare and cyber capabilities that they possess, to deny Ukraine the use of the electromagnetic spectrum.
“If Russian forces are having to use local mobile phone networks, for example, then they can’t deny those to Ukrainians, either for military uses or for civilians to communicate with the outside world.”Russian troops can’t use Era encrypted phone system in Ukraine after destroying 4G masts, suggests expert‘The leading explanation is that Era required 3G or 4G to work and the Russian Army has been destroying those masts as they advance ensuring they cannot use their own secure comms’Russian troopsarestrugglingto make their battlefieldcommunication systemswork properly, with one theory suggesting advancing units have destroyed the mobile masts they need for 3G and 4G connections.
