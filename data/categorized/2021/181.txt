These include, but are not limited to: mathematics; physics; some types of engineering; or mathematical economics. To apply, it is not necessary to have studied computer science previously.
The programme includes specialised, intensive training in programming and AI, with a wide choice of elective modules, a group project and a large individual project. There are opportunities to do both the group and individual projects with leading companies working on applications of AI.
The course will enable graduates to acquire the mathematical skills for understanding and implementing modern statistical machine learning methods, to master the logical foundations of AI, to become well-versed in a variety of current AI and machine learning techniques and develop insight into problems involved in their application, to develop the ability to evaluate the effectiveness of particular implementations, to develop the ability to deal with real-world data and scenarios, and to apply and adjust techniques to realistic applications. Through an intensive module on Python programming with a focus on AI applications, and the use of Python in other modules on machine learning, the degree will also enable students to graduate as skilled AI programmers.
This course is also a suitable preparation forPhD studies.

Artificial Intelligence in the Department of ComputingThe Department of Computing at Imperial College London has active research groups inArtificial Intelligence,Data Science, andVisual Computing. Many other groups and members of our research staff also work on theory, methods and applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning, and there are many collaborations with other departments at Imperial, as well as with industry.
We also house dedicated research centres, including theDyson Robotics Lab, theData Science Institute, theCentre for Integrative Systems Biology and Bioinformatics, theHamlyn Centre for Medical Image Computing and Robotics, and more. Also, see theImperial AI networkfor coordinated AI activity and collaboration throughout the college.
Graduates of the department with a focus on AI have gone on to work in the AI sections of such leading companies as DeepMind, Facebook, Google, and Twitter; many also progress to PhD research at Imperial and elsewhere. A graduate of the department recently had an AI company he co-foundedvalued at $1 billion, and two other graduatessold their AI startup to Twitter for $150 million.
Throughout the year, leading companies visit the department to give presentations on theApplications of Computing in Industry. Many of these are on AI, and are a great opportunity to learn about the relevance and application of what you are studying, and speak directly with people working on industrial applications. We also have dedicated extracurricular tutorials on Machine Learning from guest lecturers, and a seminar series on Applications of AI which has included talks on subjects ranging from state-of-the combinations of machine learning with symbolic AI, to the ethical implications of using AI to extend human cognition.
Student ProfilesStudent Profiles"There are so many options over different areas in the field that I can personalise my degree to exactly what I am the most interested in.""The lecturers are very good at relating their research and the module which they are teaching to the real world.""I really recommend the degree. Imperial focuses on both theoretical and practical aspects. I can be prepared both for further research degrees and for industry."Entry requirementsApplicants for this degree must possess a degree in mathematics, physics, or branches of engineering, economics or other disciplines with a substantial mathematics content. SeeMSc AI detailed entry requirementsfor more details.

DeepMind scholarshipsThe department is the recipient of three generous MSc scholarships fromDeepMind, available to those taking up an offer of a place on the MSc in AI (as well as on theMSc Computing (AI+ML)and theMRes in AI and ML). The DeepMind scholarships cover the full cost of fees and living expenses, as well as an equipment fund of £1,500 and travel funding of £2,000 for attendance at conferences. Scholars also receive invaluable support in the form of mentors from DeepMind, and events throughout the year. To apply, a candidate must hold an offer for admission on a relevant degree by13th May, 2022. For more details see our page on theDeepMind scholarships.
Women in Computing scholarshipThe department has available one scholarship for a home-fees candidate identifying as female, who will study a one-year MSc degree. To apply, a candidate must hold an offer for admission on one of our MSc degrees by31st May, 2022. For further details, please use the ImperialScholarships Search Tool.
Degree structureThe MSc in Artificial Intelligence consists of six compulsory modules (inculding the individual project) and five chosen modules. For the chosen modules, students select at least four from the list ofselectivemodules, at most one from the list ofoptionalmodules, summing to five in total. The group project mostly runs in the spring term; the individual project mostly runs over the summer.
Please note that the exact list of modules offered may be subject to change.
