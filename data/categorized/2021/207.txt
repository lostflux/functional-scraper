The Snapchat maker revamped its developer platform policies on March 17, 2022, to ban anonymous apps and require developers to build friend-finding apps to limit access to users 18 or older. The policy changes were effective immediately and existing developers were given 30 days to come into compliance \u2014 a date that would have passed last month.<\/p>\nIt is now mid-May and some developers of the newly banned and restricted apps are not yet meeting Snap\u2019s new requirements.<\/p>\nSnap confirmed to TechCrunch a small number of apps were given extensions, including anonymous apps LMK and Send It. But others seemed to be working around Snap’s ban with their friend-finding apps marketed to users ages 12+, instead of the now required 18+. They got away with this by not actually using the SDK — something impossible to tell from their App Store marketing and screenshots which imply they’re directly integrated with Snap’s features. Another app had flown under the radar, continuing to operate in violation of the rules unless TechCrunch pointed it out, resulting in a belated ban. This lack of clarity on which apps are platform apps, and which are only pretending to be, could complicate things for Snap, which is engaged in litigation over bullying-related suicides. And like all social media, the company could be under new U.S. regulation related to child safety matters in the future, as well.<\/p>\n"embed breakout\">\n"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"Bd2UjCgxsR\">"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/05\/17\/snapchats-stricter-policies-for-anonymous-apps-and-friend-finders-arent-yet-fully-enforced\/\">Snapchat’s stricter policies for anonymous apps and friend finders aren’t yet fully enforced<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"“Snapchat’s stricter policies for anonymous apps and friend finders aren’t yet fully enforced” — TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/05\/17\/snapchats-stricter-policies-for-anonymous-apps-and-friend-finders-arent-yet-fully-enforced\/embed\/#?secret=e39VRJvFjG#?secret=Bd2UjCgxsR\" data-secret=\"Bd2UjCgxsR\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\nTwitter deal still a go… for now<\/h3>\nFirst,"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/05\/13\/elon-musk-twitter-deal-on-hold-spam\/\">Elon Musk tweeted<\/a> that the Twitter deal was “temporarily on hold” until Twitter could prove the percentage of spambots on its platform was actually less than 5%, as it reports.

Now, instead of asking users to agree to any subscription price increases, developers will be able to roll out a price increase with the user\u2019s explicit consent. The feature allows developers to simply inform customers they\u2019ll be charged more, but not require the customer to opt-in to the higher pricing.<\/p>\n"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/04\/05\/apple-pilot-tests-feature-that-allows-developers-to-automatically-charge-users-for-subscription-price-increases\/\">We first broke the news that Apple was pilot testing this program<\/a> last month, when it appeared Disney+ subscription customers had simply been told their price was increasing but weren\u2019t asked for their consent. Apple then confirmed this was the result of a \u201cnew commerce feature\u201d it planned to launch soon, which it said would be \u201cgreat for both developers and users.\u201d<\/p>\nApple\u2019s position is that this could save customers the hassle of having their subscriptions automatically canceled just because they didn\u2019t see the notification or email that asked them to opt in to the price increase.<\/p>\n\u201cThis has led to some services being unintentionally interrupted for users and they must take steps to resubscribe within the app, from Settings on iPhone and iPad, or in the App Store on Mac,\u201d the company explained in its announcement on Monday.<\/p>\nHowever, the flip side of this argument is that those same customers who would have missed the consent notification will likely be the same ones who would now miss the notification informing them their subscription will be increasing in price. There\u2019s also an argument here that this change could enable unscrupulous developers and scammers to better profit from their victims if Apple doesn’t carefully enforce the program rules.<\/p>\nCurrently, those state that developers can\u2019t increase prices more than once per year. The increase also can\u2019t exceed 50% of the subscription price, and the difference in price can\u2019t exceed $5 USD per period for non-annual subscriptions or $50 USD for annual subscriptions.<\/p>\nWeekly News<\/h1>\nPlatforms: Apple<\/h3>\n\nApple"https:\/\/9to5mac.com\/2022\/05\/19\/ios-15-6-beta-1-available-public-beta-testers\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">released<\/a> the first public betas of iOS 15.6,<\/strong>\u00a0iPadOS 15.6, tvOS 15.6,"https:\/\/www.imore.com\/how-download-watchos-8-public-beta\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">watchOS 8.7<\/a> and macOS 12.5.

That\u2019s good news for startups looking for talent.<\/p>\n“I’ve always believed that people don’t join a company just for the economic benefits. They join for the opportunity to have an impact and to grow. And so in a lot of cases, it may be a more opportune time to take a chance in an early-stage company because you can focus on that long-term horizon, and you can get that opportunity to grow and have an impact,\u201d Hoffman told me.<\/p>\nFor employees, he said there will still be opportunities at good companies in any economic conditions, but attracting talent always comes down to creating a good place to work.<\/p>\n“Even in the tightest of economic environments \u2014 and we\u2019re not there yet \u2014 there\u2019s always going to be high demand for the best talent. Always. So the things that you need to do to attract, engage and retain these employees does not change,” he said.

for comment, cofounder Pejman Nozad emailed back, “I can’t comment!”<\/p>\nNozad and cofounder Mar Hershenson have long been first-stop for prominent early-stage investors that are looking to fund nascent teams, given the firm has been among the earliest backers in a notable number of companies that have gone to raise ever-bigger rounds and higher valuations, including the now publicly traded companies DoorDash and Guardant Health.<\/p>\nOther startups to attract capital from Pear before nearly any other firm was aware of their existence include the deep-linking startup Branch, which

likely to see the valuations of its still-private portfolio companies slide downward — possibly by a lot — depending on how long this correction lasts.<\/p>\nHershenson, who joined TechCrunch for a mobility-focused event this week, noted on stage that startups are in for a bumpy ride, given how frothy the market had grown.<\/p>"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\nAsked if the"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/for-tech-startups-the-party-is-over-11652710330?mod=tech_lead_pos5\">startup party is over<\/a>, Hershenson answered: “Maybe for a little while it’s over . . .The problem is that the market was priced too high in 2021, and we’re all adjusting to that price change, and that changes how companies raise money.<\/p>\n“Everybody knows that the stock market is down a lot,” she’d said. “Software stocks are down in some cases 80%. [Meanwhile] if you’re a private company, and you were very lucky and you raised money in 2021, you may have gotten a multiple of 100x on your ARR. Today, those multiples are 10x or 20x. That means that if your company was $2 billion [at the time of your fundraise], your company is [now] worth $200 million.:<\/p>\nEven with a steep reset in prices, however, Pear’s success to date is undeniable. It’s also unlikely.<\/p>\nNozad, very famously, was earlier a rug dealer who insisted on toting rugs to his clients’ homes, where during the course of long conversations, they would learn about the rug and he would learn about their business. He eventually became a scout for his boss, and a trusted friend to some very powerful people.<\/p>\n\u201cHe has a good sniffer, and I trust the guy,\u201d\u00a0 Sequoia\u2019s Doug Leone"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/victoriabarret\/2012\/03\/21\/silicon-valleys-hottest-vc-is-a-rug-dealer\/?sh=3dfe6dbb31d5\">told Forbes<\/a> back in 2012. \u201cHe\u2019s like me, from the earth.\u201d Sequoia has, in fact, backed a number of companies that Pear has funded, including Guardant Health and DoorDash.<\/p>\nMeanwhile, his partner, Mar Hershenson, was also very much an outlier when the two struck out on their own. Despite founding several companies previously — one of which Nozad backed — and though she holds an M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Stanford University, she is a native of Spain and even more unusual in VC circles a decade ago, she is a woman who had not previously cut her teeth at someone else’s venture firm.<\/p>\nThat may not seem very notable today but in 2012, it put Hershenson in rare company.<\/p>\nAs for the team’s newest bets, Pear hosted an invite-only demo day earlier this week, coverage of which we’ll have for readers soon. (Unlike Y Combinator, the outfit holds a demo day each year for a comparatively limited number of companies — typically around 10.)<\/p>\nIn the meantime, some of its other recent checks have gone to Sudozi, a two-year-old Austin, Tex., startup that provides a SaaS platform to help enterprises improve their money management capabilities and that just this month announced a"https:\/\/venturebeat.com\/2022\/05\/12\/sudozi-nabs-4-3m-to-simplify-money-management-for-enterprises\/\">$4.3 million<\/a> seed round led by Pear.<\/p>\nPear also recently wrote a follow-on check to Osmind, a two-year-old, Bay Area-based startup that makes software to chart and update patient information and documents, with a focus on mental health.

It also appeals to the broader vision of truly democratized AI not beholden to shareholders.”<\/p>\nBrian Lee and Andrew Jackson, two Google employees, worked together to create"https:\/\/github.com\/tensorflow\/minigo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">MiniGo<\/a>, a replication of AlphaZero.

There’s enough detail for the experienced navigator to find their way, but if you don’t know how to read a compass, you’ll be hopelessly lost. You won’t retrace the steps exactly, but you’ll end up in the same place.”<\/p>\nThe developers behind these initiatives, Ahdritz and Jackson included, say that they’ll not only help to demonstrate whether the systems work as advertised but enable new applications and better hardware support. Systems from large labs and companies like DeepMind, OpenAI, Microsoft, Amazon and Meta are typically trained on expensive, proprietary data center servers with far more compute power than the average workstation, adding to the hurdles of open sourcing them.<\/p>\n“Training new variants of AlphaFold could lead to new applications beyond protein structure prediction, which is not possible with DeepMind\u2019s original code release because it lacked the training code — for example, predicting how drugs bind proteins, how proteins move, and how proteins interact with other biomolecules,” Ahdritz\u00a0 said. “There are dozens of high-impact applications that require training new variants of AlphaFold or integrating parts of AlphaFold into larger models, but the lack of training code prevents all of them.”<\/p>\n“These open-source efforts do a lot to disseminate the ‘working knowledge’ about how these systems can behave in non-academic settings,” Jackson added. “The amount of compute needed to reproduce the original results [for AlphaZero] is pretty high. I don\u2019t remember the number off the top of my head, but it involved running about a thousand GPUs for a week. We were in a pretty unique position to be able to help the community try these models with our early access to the Google Cloud Platform\u2019s"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/05\/11\/google-launches-a-9-exaflop-cluster-of-cloud-tpu-v4-pods-into-public-preview\/\">TPU<\/a> product, which was not yet publicly available.”<\/p>\nImplementing proprietary systems in open source is fraught with challenges, especially when there’s little public information to go on. Ideally, the code is available in addition to the data set used to train the system and what are called weights, which are responsible for transforming data fed to the system into predictions. But this isn’t often the case.<\/p>\nFor example, in developing OpenFold, Ahdritz and team had to gather information from the official materials and reconcile the differences between different sources, including the source code, supplemental code and presentations that DeepMind researchers gave early on. Ambiguities in steps like data prep and training code led to false starts, while a lack of hardware resources necessitated design compromises.<\/p>\n“We only really get a handful of tries to get this right, lest this drag on indefinitely. These things have so many computationally intensive stages that a tiny bug can greatly set us back, such that we had to retrain the model and also regenerate lots of training data,” Ahdritz said. “Some technical details that work very well for [DeepMind] don’t work as easily for us because we have different hardware … In addition, ambiguity about what details are critically important and which ones are selected without much thought makes it hard to optimize or tweak anything and locks us in to whatever (sometimes awkward) choices were made in the original system.”<\/p>\nSo, do the labs behind the proprietary systems, like OpenAI, care that their work is being reverse-engineered and even used by startups to"https:\/\/venturebeat.com\/2021\/12\/23\/open-source-nlp-is-fueling-a-new-wave-of-startups\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">launch competing services<\/a>? Evidently not. Ahdritz says the fact that DeepMind in particular releases so many details about its systems suggests it implicitly endorses the efforts, even if it hasn’t said so publicly.<\/p>\n“We haven\u2019t received any clear indication that DeepMind disapproves or approves of this effort,” Ahdritz said. “But certainly, no one has tried to stop us.”<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Benchmarks are as important a measure of progress in AI as they are for the rest of the software industry.

target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fetcher<\/a>, the talent acquisition platform formerly known as Scout, today closed a $27 million Series B funding round led by Tola Capital with participation from G20 Ventures, KFund and Accomplice. The new money — $7 million in debt and $20 million in equity — brings the startup’s total capital raised to $40 million, which co-founder and CEO Andres Blank says is being put toward international expansion and building out the Fetcher platform with new applicant tracking system (ATS) integrations and customer relationship management capabilities.<\/p>\nFetcher was co-launched in 2014 by Blank, Chris Calmeyn, Javier Castiarena and Santi Aimetta as a professional networking app called Caliber. After a few years, the founding Fetcher team decided to pivot into recruitment, leveraging some of the automation technology they’d built into Caliber.<\/p>\n“Hiring high-quality, diverse candidates had always been a pain point for me. At one of my prior startups, I personally experienced this issue, and after bringing on a recruiting team to help scale hiring efforts, I saw that their time was also too valuable to be spent on the manual, repetitive tasks that come with sourcing candidates,” Blank told TechCrunch in an email interview. “Rather than relying on expensive staffing fees, I thought there must be a better way to keep sourcing in-house, without it taking up too much time and energy on the talent acquisition teams and hiring managers.”<\/p>\nThrough a Chrome extension, Fetcher\u2019s platform ties in with ATS products as well as Gmail and Outlook to allow recruiters to source candidates directly from LinkedIn. Fetcher filters jobseekers into prebuilt email workflows, offering analytics including progress toward diversity goals at the individual, team, position and company levels.<\/p>\n"attachment_2319457\" style=\"width: 1436px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">"caption-attachment-2319457\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2319457 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Fetcher-Candidate-Directory.png\" alt=\"Fetcher\" width=\"1426\" height=\"816\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Fetcher-Candidate-Directory.png 1426w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Fetcher-Candidate-Directory.png?resize=150,86 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Fetcher-Candidate-Directory.png?resize=300,172 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Fetcher-Candidate-Directory.png?resize=768,439 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Fetcher-Candidate-Directory.png?resize=680,389 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Fetcher-Candidate-Directory.png?resize=50,29 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1426px) 100vw, 1426px\" \/>"caption-attachment-2319457\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Fetcher candidate directory.
Image Credits:<\/strong> Fetcher<\/p><\/div><\/p>\nFetcher also performs predictive modeling, automatically gauging the interest of job candidates from their replies, and “automated sourcing,” which runs in the background to push applicants through vetting processes via automated emails.<\/p>\n“A great candidate experience is essential for any company, and part of that experience comes from building long-term relationships with candidates over time. Fetcher\u2019s candidate directory allows companies to remarket to qualified candidates, set up reminders for future connections, and add additional outreach emails to the automated sequences,” Blank said. “Overall, the goal is to make it simple for companies to store, update, and connect with great candidates over time, messaging them about future job opportunities, milestones at the company, and more.”<\/p>"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\nThe reliance on algorithms is a bit concerning, given the potential for bias — Amazon infamously"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-amazon-com-jobs-automation-insight\/amazon-scraps-secret-ai-recruiting-tool-that-showed-bias-against-women-idUSKCN1MK08G\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">scrapped<\/a> a recruitment algorithm that favored male engineers and New York City recently placed"https:\/\/www.brookings.edu\/blog\/techtank\/2021\/12\/20\/why-new-york-city-is-cracking-down-on-ai-in-hiring\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">restrictions<\/a> on the use of AI in hiring. When asked about it, Blank asserted that the platform’s automation technologies allow for “a more diverse group of prospects” to push through the hiring funnel. He also highlighted Fetcher’s outreach policy, noting that people who don’t wish to be contacted about opportunities via Fetcher can send data deletion requests.<\/p>\n“[O]ur secret sauce here at Fetcher is combining both machine and human intelligence in order to minimize the biases that exist on both sides,” Blank said. “Beyond this, we also have diversity metrics on each search (visible on our platform to the client too), which keeps us in check. If we\u2019re over- or under-indexing anywhere on the gender or demographics front, the platform can course correct. Finally, we remove selection biases from the client. The way we do this is that once a client trusts that the search is heading in the right direction (after vetting a handful of candidates upfront), they place the search on full automation. This means that going forward, they are no longer vetting every candidate, but simply reaching out to all qualified candidates that are found for [a given] open role.”<\/p>\nBlank linked to case studies from customers like Frame.io, which recently used Fetcher to hire employees mostly from underrepresented groups. But biases can enter at many different, often unpredictable, stages of the pipeline. As Harvard Business Review’s Miranda Bogen"https:\/\/hbr.org\/2019\/05\/all-the-ways-hiring-algorithms-can-introduce-bias\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">writes<\/a>: “For example, if [a] system notices that recruiters happen to interact more frequently with white men, it may well find proxies for those characteristics (like being named Jared or playing high school lacrosse) and replicate that pattern. This sort of adverse impact can happen without explicit instruction, and worse, without anyone realizing.”<\/p>\n"attachment_2319458\" style=\"width: 1410px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">"caption-attachment-2319458\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2319458 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Fetcher-Dashboard.png\" alt=\"Fetcher\" width=\"1400\" height=\"806\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Fetcher-Dashboard.png 1400w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Fetcher-Dashboard.png?resize=150,86 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Fetcher-Dashboard.png?resize=300,173 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Fetcher-Dashboard.png?resize=768,442 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Fetcher-Dashboard.png?resize=680,391 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Fetcher-Dashboard.png?resize=50,29 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px\" \/>"caption-attachment-2319458\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image Credits:<\/strong> Fetcher<\/p><\/div><\/p>\nThe risk doesn’t appear to be dissuading recruiters. Fetcher currently has over 350 customers (growing 10% month-over-month) including Behr Paint, Albertsons, Foursquare and Shutterstock., and annual recurring revenue tripled in the last 12 months.<\/p>\nBeyond the strong top-line numbers, Fetcher is benefiting from the broader boom in the HR tech segment, which has seen high venture capital activity over the past few months.
"https:\/\/pitchbook.com\/news\/articles\/venture-capital-human-resources-tech-valuations\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">According<\/a> to PitchBook, HR tech startups collected more than $9.2 billion in venture capital funding globally from January 2021 to October 2021 — a 130% jump from 2020’s total.<\/p>\n“Fetcher is uniquely positioned as one of the only software-as-a-service recruiting platforms to automate both candidate sourcing and email outreach efficiently,” Blank said. “Rather than using a straight database model, Fetcher is the only sourcing solution that can truly automate the sourcing process for companies, based on its unique combination of ‘machine learning with human intelligence.’ This model allows for what feels like a 24\/7 sourcer to work in the background for each client. By automating both the sourcing and outreach sides of recruiting, Fetcher can reduce the number of internal sourcers and recruiters a company needs, as well as significantly reduce the budget being spent on outside recruiting firms, agencies, or consultants.”<\/p>\nFetcher employs 45 people, currently, and plans to double that number by the end of the year.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Reflecting the growing investor interest in HR technology startups, Fetcher, the talent acquisition platform formerly known as Scout, today closed a $27 million Series B funding round led by Tola Capital with participation from G20 Ventures, KFund and Accomplice.

Columbia Capital, StepStone Group and DHL. CEO Julie Gerdeman said that the new money would be used to “propel technology innovation” and “further global expansion.”<\/p>\nEverstream, which was launched as Resilience360 and Riskpulse, provides predictive insights for supply chains. Drawing on billions of supply chain interactions, the company applies AI to assess materials, suppliers and facilities for risk.<\/p>\nPlenty of startups claim to do this, including"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/04\/14\/backbone-nabs-14m-for-supply-chain-software-inspired-by-mesh-networks\/\">Backbone<\/a>,"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/11\/24\/altana-raises-7m-to-protect-supply-chains-from-disruptions-child-labor\/\">Altana<\/a> and"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/21\/as-the-pandemic-creates-supply-chain-chaos-craft-raises-10m-to-apply-some-intelligence\/\">Craft<\/a>. Project44 recently raised $202 million to expand its own set of predictive analytics tools, including estimated time of arrivals for shipments.<\/p>\nBut what sets Everstream apart is its access to proprietary data that goes beyond what competitors are leveraging, according to Gerdeman.<\/p>\n“[Everstream provides] visibility into essentially every network, component, ingredient, \u200band raw material around the world,” she told TechCrunch via email. “Connected business networks, scalable computing power, graph data base technology, and advances in AI algorithms enable Everstream to combine massive volumes of public and proprietary data to build a model of the global supply chain.”<\/p>\nAs new data enters the platform, Everstream, which integrates with existing enterprise resource planning systems, retrains its AI system to reflect the current supply chain environment. Customers receive proactive warnings based on signals, including financial reports and news of weather events, environmental and sustainability risks, and natural disasters.<\/p>\nFor example, Everstream can warn businesses when it might be difficult to source a specific material and how likely customers are to cancel, increase, or move forward orders. It also can provide suggestions for optimizing logistics operations based on metrics such as timeliness, quality and cost of goods shipped.<\/p>"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n“Everstream\u2019s AI-based models and preset dynamic thresholds can be used to predict disruptions and prescribe recommendations to mitigate risk and deliver better results to the business needs,” Gerdeman added. “[Everstream] identifies the most impactful risks in the network and creates targeted insights-based on inputs from the … platform, including incident monitoring, predictive risks,"https:\/\/www.weforum.org\/agenda\/2022\/03\/how-esg-education-can-unlock-the-supply-chain-s-potential\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ESG<\/a>, and shipment data — slashing time, cost, and complexity.”<\/p>\nMost would argue these are useful tools at a time when uncertainty continues to dog the supply chain — assuming Everstream’s AI systems perform as well as advertised.

Mum’s the word on concrete revenue numbers; Gerdeman demurred when asked about them.<\/p>\n“The pandemic has illustrated why deep visibility is needed not only into a company’s network, but down to the component, ingredient, \u200band raw material level, because it doesn\u2019t matter if the company’s supplier is operational if their suppliers are not,” Gerdeman said. “Everstream\u2019s insights are not only predictive in nature, but they are also prescriptive \u2013 meaning we not only tell clients what\u2019s coming next, but also what they should do about it.”<\/p>\nEverstream, which employs 100 people, has raised $70 million in equity and debt funding so far.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Everstream Analytics, a supply chain insights and risk analytics startup, today announced that it raised $24 million in a Series A round led by Morgan Stanley Investment Management with participation from Columbia Capital, StepStone Group and DHL.

that bills itself as an “open source” platform for data labeling, today announced that it landed $25 million in a Series A funding round led by Redpoint Ventures. Unusual Ventures, Bow Capital and Swift Ventures also participated, bringing Heartex’s total capital raised to $30 million.<\/p>\nCo-founder and CEO Michael Malyuk said that the new money will be put toward improving Heartex’s product and expanding the size of the company’s workforce from 28 people to 68 by the end of the year.<\/p>\n“Coming from engineering and machine learning backgrounds, [Heartex’s founding team] knew what value machine learning and AI can bring to the organization,” Malyuk told TechCrunch via email. “At the time, we all worked at different companies and in different industries yet shared the same struggle with model accuracy due to poor-quality training data.

Image Credits:<\/strong> Heartex<\/p><\/div><\/p>\nThe ties to Yandex, a company sometimes referred to as the “Google of Russia”, might unnerve some — particularly in light of"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/16\/russia-yandex-news-vk\/\">accusations<\/a> by the European Union that Yandex’s news division played a sizeable role in spreading Kremlin propaganda. Heartex has an office in San Francisco, California, but several of the company’s engineers are based in the former Soviet Republic of Georgia.<\/p>\nWhen asked, Heartex says that it doesn’t collect any customer data and open sources the core of its labeling platform for inspection. “We\u2019ve built a data architecture that keeps data private on the customer\u2019s storage, separating the data plane and control plane,” Malyuk added. “Regarding the team and their locations, we’re a very international team with no current members based in Russia.”<\/p>"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\nSetting aside its geopolitical affiliations, Heartex aims to tackle what Malyuk sees as a major hurdle in the enterprise: extracting value from data by leveraging AI. There’s a growing wave of businesses aiming to become “data-centric” — Gartner recently"https:\/\/venturebeat.com\/2019\/01\/21\/gartner-enterprise-ai-implementation-grew-270-over-the-past-four-years\/\">reported<\/a> that enterprise use of AI grew a whopping 270% over the past several years. But many organizations are"https:\/\/www.mckinsey.com\/featured-insights\/artificial-intelligence\/global-ai-survey-ai-proves-its-worth-but-few-scale-impact\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">struggling<\/a> to use AI to its fullest.<\/p>\n“Having reached a point of diminishing returns in algorithm-specific development, enterprises are investing in perfecting data labeling as part of their strategic, data-centric initiatives,” Malyuk said. “This is a progression from earlier development practices that focused almost exclusively on algorithm development and tuning.”<\/p>\nIf, as Malyuk asserts, data labeling is receiving increased attention from companies pursuing AI, it’s because labeling is a core part of the AI development process. Many AI systems “learn” to make sense of images, videos, text and audio from examples that have been labeled by teams of human annotators. The labels enable the systems to extrapolate the relationships between the examples (e.g. the link between the caption “kitchen sink” and a photo of a kitchen sink) to data the systems haven\u2019t seen before (e.g. photos of kitchen sinks that weren\u2019t included in the data used to “teach” the model).<\/p>\nThe trouble is, not all labels are created equal. Labeling data like legal contracts, medical images and scientific literature requires domain expertise that not just any annotator has. And — being human — annotators make mistakes. In an MIT"https:\/\/venturebeat.com\/2021\/03\/28\/mit-study-finds-systematic-labeling-errors-in-popular-ai-benchmark-datasets\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">analysis<\/a> of popular AI datasets, researchers found mislabeled data like one breed of dog confused for another and an Ariana Grande high note categorized as a whistle.<\/p>\n"attachment_2314885\" style=\"width: 1134px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">"caption-attachment-2314885\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2314885 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/nested_labeling.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"1124\" height=\"624\" \/>"caption-attachment-2314885\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image Credits:<\/strong> Heartex<\/p><\/div><\/p>\nMalyuk makes no claim that Heartex completely solves these issues. But in an interview, he explained that the platform is designed to support labeling workflows for different AI use cases, with features that touch on data quality management, reporting and analytics. For example, data engineers using Heartex can see the names and email addresses of annotators and data reviewers, which are tied to labels that they’ve contributed or audited. This helps to monitor label quality and — ideally — to fix problems before they impact training data.<\/p>\n“The angle for the C-suite is pretty simple. It\u2019s all about improving production AI model accuracy in service of achieving the project\u2019s business objective,” Malyuk said. “We\u2019re finding that most C-suite managers with AI, machine learning, and\/or data science responsibilities have confirmed through experience that, with more strategic investments in people, processes, technology, and data, AI can deliver extraordinary value to the business across a multitude of diverse use cases. We also see that success has a snowball effect. Teams that find success early are able to create additional high-value models more quickly building not just on their early learnings but also on the additional data generated from using the production models.”<\/p>\nIn the data labeling toolset arena, Heartex competes with startups including"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/01\/02\/aimmo-grabs-12m-series-a-to-advance-data-labeling-technology\/\">AIMMO<\/a>,"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/07\/30\/labelbox\/\">Labelbox<\/a>,"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/11\/03\/scale-ai-acquires-siasearch-to-give-companies-the-same-data-engine-superpowers-that-tesla-has\/\">Scale AI<\/a> and"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/14\/snorkel-ai-pitch-raise-techcrunch-live\/\">Snorkel AI<\/a>, as well as Google and Amazon (which offers data labeling products through Google Cloud and"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/12\/01\/aws-launches-sagemaker-studio-lab-a-free-tool-for-learning-machine-learning\/\">SageMaker<\/a>, respectively). But Malyuk believes that Heartex’s focus on software as opposed to services sets it apart from the rest. Unlike many of its competitors, the startup doesn’t sell labeling services through its platform.<\/p>\n“As we\u2019ve built a truly horizontal solution, our customers come from a variety of industries. We have small startups as customers, as well as several Fortune 100 companies. [Our platform] has been adopted by over 100,000 data scientists globally,” Malyuk said, while declining to reveal revenue numbers. “[Our customers] are establishing internal data annotation teams and buying [our product] because their production AI models aren\u2019t performing well and recognize that poor training data quality is the primary cause.”<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Heartex, a startup that bills itself as an “open source” platform for data labeling, today announced that it landed $25 million in a Series A funding round led by Redpoint Ventures.

"https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/pages\/cognitive-university-watson-systems-smartseller\">According<\/a> to McKinsey, employees spend 1.8 hours every day — 9.3 hours per week, on average — searching for and gathering information. The"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/pulse\/time-spent-searching-chronology-myth-some-recent-research-white\/\">veracity<\/a> of metrics like these has been challenged over the years. But it’s reasonable to say that knowledge workers in particular devote a sizeable chunk of their workdays to sifting through data, whether to find basic contact info or domain-specific files.<\/p>\nThe emergence in recent years of AI algorithms that can parse natural language has fueled the rise of platforms that can shrink that chunk. At least, that’s the assertion of Arvind Jain, a former Google engineer and Rubrik co-founder, whose startup,"http:\/\/glean.com\">Glean<\/a>, employs AI to power a unified search experience across all apps used at a company.<\/p>\nArvind, a former Google engineer, began work on Glean at Rubrik, the cloud data management company. In Rubrik\u2019s annual employee pulse survey, Arvind observed that one of the biggest productivity challenges was workers not being able to find the information they needed — whether a specific document or subject-matter expert.<\/p>\n“Engineers were spending too much time outside code; account managers couldn\u2019t find the latest research or presentation needed to close deals; new employees took too long to ramp,” Arvind told TechCrunch in an email interview. “This growing problem was not only destroying productivity, but also sapping energy and detracting from the employee experience.”<\/p>\nOther companies were experiencing the same issues, as it turned out — exacerbated by their"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/11\/03\/were-still-just-scratching-the-surface-of-the-clouds-potential\/\">embrace of the cloud<\/a> and"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/11\/09\/distributed-work-not-remote-work\/\">distributed work setups<\/a>. Sensing an opportunity, Arvind managed to convince former engineering lead Piyush Prahladka, ex-Facebook and -Microsoft engineer T.R. Vishwanath, and Tony Gentilcore, previously at AT&T and Google, to build the prototype for Glean.<\/p>\nFast forward to 2022, and Glean has over 70 customers including Okta, Confluent, Samsara, Grammarly, and Outreach. Reflecting growth since its 2019 founding, Glean today closed a $100 million Series C round led by Sequoia with participation from Lightspeed, General Catalyst, Kleiner Perkins and the Slack Fund at a $1 billion valuation post-money.<\/p>\nOn the one hand, Glean’s technology isn’t incredibly novel. Services like Microsoft\u2019s SharePoint Syntex, Amazon"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/11\/amazon-releases-kendra-to-solve-enterprise-search-with-ai-and-machine-learning\/\">Kendra<\/a>, and Google Cloud Search tap natural language processing technology to understand not only document minutia but the searches employees across an organization might perform, like “How do I invest in our company\u2019s 401k?” They fall under the banner of “cognitive search,” a product category encompassing search tools that implement AI to ingest, understand, organize, and query data from multiple sources.<\/p>"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\nBut Arvind claims that Glean is simpler to set up and use than the competition, including smaller outfits like Coveo, Elastic, Lucidworks, and Mindbreeze.<\/p>\n"attachment_2320740\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">"caption-attachment-2320740\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2320740\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Glean-New-Tab-Page-May-2022-1.png?w=680\" alt=\"Glean\" width=\"680\" height=\"644\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Glean-New-Tab-Page-May-2022-1.png 1280w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Glean-New-Tab-Page-May-2022-1.png?resize=150,142 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Glean-New-Tab-Page-May-2022-1.png?resize=300,284 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Glean-New-Tab-Page-May-2022-1.png?resize=768,728 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Glean-New-Tab-Page-May-2022-1.png?resize=680,644 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Glean-New-Tab-Page-May-2022-1.png?resize=50,47 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/>"caption-attachment-2320740\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image Credits:<\/strong> Glean<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n“[Glean] takes less than two hours for initial setup, and doesn\u2019t require any engineering talent or manual fine-tuning for implementation,” Arvind said. “And Glean has seamless workflow integration, whether you\u2019re using Glean in the web app, new tab page, sidebar search, native search, or Slack commands.”<\/p>\nArvind notes that one of the major problems in enterprise search is the diversity of data sources, like knowledge bases, tickets, chat messages, and pull requests. To address this, Glean uses AI systems to predict for every query the relative importance of content across these sources, training separate systems on customer data to learn company-specific jargon, concepts, entities, and acronyms. To deliver personalized results, as well as proactively recommend documents, Glean accounts for variables like a person’s role, work patterns, job function, and specific projects and responsibilities in its indexing.<\/p>\n“Glean\u2019s biggest competitor is the status quo: employees continuing to deal with the complexity of finding the information and people they need at work. In a typical sales process, potential customers often require Glean to first start with a pilot to demonstrate how much value implementing Glean can provide,” Arvind said. “Glean uses the user\u2019s information to personalize the search experience for the user along several dimensions — for example, for the same query an engineer may see very different results than a sales executive. Glean also uses the user\u2019s activity, such as clicks on search results, to improve the search relevance.”<\/p>\nBecause Glean acts like a layer on top of all other apps a company uses, it can double as a work portal from where managers can create and share “shortlinks” to resources (e.g., “go\/benefits” instead of a long URL). Management can also share news, handbooks, expense policies, KPI dashboards, and company OKRs and expose the company’s people directory, which shows who people are and what projects they’re working on.<\/p>\nIn a dashboard, Glean surfaces answers to frequently asked questions and devotes a space to links and descriptions of those links that can be shared with the wider organization. A control panel allows users to run data loss prevention reports on the sources from which Glean draws and check for compliance with GDPR, CCPA, and other privacy regulations.<\/p>\n“Prospective customers are often anxious about providing Glean with access to all of their data, which is why Glean has spent so much time ensuring it respects all privacy controls from the applications that it integrates with, and invested heavily in security certifications and processes from the very beginning … When [a] user deletes a document in the underlying application (Slack, Drive, Office, etc.), the document gets deleted from the Glean system as well,” Arvind said. “Glean customers can choose to have Glean host them or self-host Glean to keep their information within their environment. With Glean\u2019s e-discovery and data loss prevention tools, companies can be confident about what data is available within their organization — and how that information is used.”<\/p>\nNo enterprise search tool is without limitations. In a 2021 survey by APQC, which provides benchmarks and best practices for businesses, 19% of workers said that poor search functionality is a key problem in their organizations. But there’s a healthy market for enterprise search solutions regardless. The same survey found that 41% of respondents expect to “significantly” increase investment in search and findability within their organizations in the next 12 to 18 months.<\/p>\nGlean, whose total capital raised stands at $155 million, plans to use the proceeds from the latest round to expand its team, build out a go-to-market plan, and “drive new feature innovation.” Glean has more than 100 employees today and expects to have over 250 by the end of the year.<\/p>\n“Increased value put on employee productivity and happiness has been a boon to Glean\u2019s growth among fast-growing companies that care about employee experience,” Arvind said. “Glean provides value to prospective customers from the first minute they start searching, and Glean is constantly working through product development and customer enablement to ensure customers have the best experience from then on.”<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"At enterprises of a certain size, keeping track of data including apps, employees, and projects becomes increasingly challenging.

developing a product to monitor the status of machines and electrical infrastructure, today announced that it closed a $15 million Series A funding round led by Next47, with participation from Y Combinator and others. The money will be put toward product development and expanding Tractian’s workforce and geographic footprint, according to co-founder and co-CEO Igor Marinelli, as well as ongoing customer acquisition efforts.<\/p>\nFounded in 2019, Tractian is the brainchild of Y Combinator alumni Marinelli and Gabriel Lameirinhas. Prior to starting Tractian, they worked at a paper manufacturer, International Paper, as software engineers, where Marinelli says they noticed how backwards the systems were for monitoring machinery health.<\/p>\n“Industrial managers of any kind need traceability of work orders, and need to know the health of their machines from kilometers away from the operations,” Marinelli said. “[W]ithout the proper combination of hardware and software, you can’t solve the industry’s real challenge.”<\/p>\nTractian’s flagship product, which Marinelli says is patent pending in the U.S., uses AI to identify mechanical problems a machine might be having by analyzing its “rotational assets,” like motors, pumps and compressors. Tractian can spot signs of looseness, imbalance and misalignment from vibration and temperature anomalies measured by custom sensors, Marinelli claims, in addition to potential electrical failures.<\/p>\n“Basically, the platform uses vibration, temperature, and electrical parameters data as well as information on the specifications of the monitored assets, such as power, rotation, fixation, assembly information, among others. The data can be divided into two groups: those referring to spectral analysis and those referring to temporal analysis,” Marinelli explained. “"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">Spectrum data is used for deeper analysis to interpret the machine more directly. Through the spectrum, it is possible to recognize each of the internal components of a machine and how they are operating … In the case of machines, we are able to know which components are being activated and how they are being activated and thus identify failures.”<\/span><\/p>\nTractian provides sensors that attach to — and send data about — machines via 3G or 4G cellular networks. The company’s software provides checklist and inspection steps for each machine, plus diagnostics, recommendations, alerts and scheduling tools and inventories.<\/p>\n"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">“A model is only as accurate as the richness and relevance of its training data, so we place great value on the information used for training,” Marinelli added. “The models at first are generalist, being prepared for a global operation and not being individualized. However, from the moment we associate a branch of this model to a machine, it starts to learn the failure pattern for a specific machine.”<\/span><\/p>"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n"attachment_2315368\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">"caption-attachment-2315368\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2315368\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/mock-tablet-tractian-slhstrom-2-1.png?w=680\" alt=\"Tractian\" width=\"680\" height=\"510\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/mock-tablet-tractian-slhstrom-2-1.png 2668w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/mock-tablet-tractian-slhstrom-2-1.png?resize=150,112 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/mock-tablet-tractian-slhstrom-2-1.png?resize=300,225 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/mock-tablet-tractian-slhstrom-2-1.png?resize=768,576 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/mock-tablet-tractian-slhstrom-2-1.png?resize=680,510 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/mock-tablet-tractian-slhstrom-2-1.png?resize=1536,1151 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/mock-tablet-tractian-slhstrom-2-1.png?resize=2048,1535 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/mock-tablet-tractian-slhstrom-2-1.png?resize=50,37 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/>"caption-attachment-2315368\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Monitoring equipment with Tractian.
Image Credits:<\/strong> Tractian<\/p><\/div><\/p>\nMarinelli readily acknowledges that Tractian isn’t the first to the machine analytics space. Predictive maintenance technologies have been used for decades in jet engines and gas turbines, and companies including Samsara, Augury, Upkeep and MaintainX offer solutions with capabilities similar to Tractian. In April, Amazon threw its hat in the ring with the general launch of Lookout for Equipment, a service that ingests sensor data from a customer\u2019s industrial equipment and then trains a machine learning model to predict early warning signs of machine failure.<\/p>\nIn a sign of the segment’s competitiveness, Augury just this month acquired Seebo, a startup that provided manufacturing teams with the insights to optimize their industrial processes. Augury is one of the better-funded startups in the sector, having raised nearly $300 million in venture capital to date.<\/p>\nBut both Marinelli and Lameirinhas sense opportunity in a"https:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/predictive-maintenance-market-worth-12-3-billion-by-2025--exclusive-report-by-marketsandmarkets-301096038.html#:~:text=Men's%20Interest-,Predictive%20Maintenance%20Market%20Worth%20%2412.3%20Billion%20by,Exclusive%20Report%20by%20MarketsandMarkets%E2%84%A2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">market<\/a> that could be worth $12.3 billion by 2025. In 2018, Gartner"https:\/\/www.designworldonline.com\/is-predictive-maintenance-the-killer-app-of-industrial-iot\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">predicted<\/a> that by 2022, spend on internet of things-enabled predictive maintenance would increase to $12.9 billion, up from $3.4 billion in 2018.<\/p>\nWhile Marinelli noted that Tractian’s customer base of roughly 200 companies spans well-known brands like John Deere, Bosch, Embraer and Hyundai.<\/p>\nLooking ahead, the key for Tractian will be convincing would-be customers that its technology performs better than the rest. In a"https:\/\/www.mckinsey.com\/business-functions\/operations\/our-insights\/establishing-the-right-analytics-based-maintenance-strategy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">survey<\/a> by McKinsey, analysts at the firm highlight the dangers of an under-performing predictive maintenance algorithm, claiming that one company saved over 10% on the breakdown of a piece of equipment using an algorithm but spent significantly more as a result of the algorithm’s high false-positive rate.<\/p>\n“[O]ur technology involves the same concept of Shazam, but for machines,” Marinelli said.
"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">“[Our] models are audited by an internal quality team, where we test the results obtained in a scientific approach in our laboratory, simulating failures and working with the development team to ensure accuracy. In addition to the internal audit, all generated inferences in production are validated directly by the client and they indicate the accuracy and application of the model through a real-time feedback system.”<\/span><\/p>\n"font-weight: 400;\">In March, Tractian announced its expansion to North America, opening a new office in Mexico with a team dedicated to developing the company’s activities there. Tractian plans to follow up with market entry in Atlanta, Georgia later this year.<\/span><\/p>\nWhen reached for comment, Debjit Mukerji, a partner at Next47 who plans to join"font-weight: 400;\">Tractian’s board of directors, said: <\/span>“This is a critical space, the heartbeat of our economy.

While serverless functions-as-a-service (FaaS) products like AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions and CloudFlare Workers can help ease the complexity, they aren’t always the right fit for developers looking to deploy and run integrations with other software apps. Just ask the team at BrightRoll, the programmatic video advertising platform acquired by Yahoo! (full disclosure: TechCrunch’s parent company) in 2014, which ran 176 unique data pipelines to manage various app integrations.<\/p>\nFrustrated by the process, Tod Sacerdoti, who co-founded BrightRoll before a tenure at Flex Capital as an investor, teamed up with seven former BrightRoll employees in product and engineering roles to found"https:\/\/pipedream.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pipedream<\/a>, an integration platform for building workflows and connecting cloud services. Pipedream allows customers to create workflows with open source connectors to APIs and extensions coded in Node.js, Python, Go or Bash for custom logic.<\/p>\nInvestors lined up behind the idea. Today, Pipedream announced that it raised $20 million in a funding round led by True Ventures, with participation from CRV, Felicis Ventures and the World Innovation Lab. Sacerdoti says that the proceeds will be put toward further developing Pipedream’s product, expanding the number of apps on the platform and building out a go-to-market team.<\/p>\n"attachment_2315830\" style=\"width: 1159px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">"caption-attachment-2315830\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2315830 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Pipedream_2.png\" alt=\"Pipedream\" width=\"1149\" height=\"705\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Pipedream_2.png 1149w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Pipedream_2.png?resize=150,92 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Pipedream_2.png?resize=300,184 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Pipedream_2.png?resize=768,471 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Pipedream_2.png?resize=680,417 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Pipedream_2.png?resize=50,31 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1149px) 100vw, 1149px\" \/>"caption-attachment-2315830\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Pipedream’s app integration interface.
Image Credits:<\/strong> Pipedream<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n“When BrightRoll was acquired, there was an internal team of ten employees called the ‘product hackers’ that was responsible for [app] integrations … While the business value of the team was massive, it took tremendous resources to build and manage the integrations. We felt there had to be a better way,” Sacerdoti told TechCrunch in an email interview. “When we interviewed our first 30 potential customers, one of them said, ‘This would be so valuable if it existed but it is impossible to build. It\u2019s a Pipedream.’ Hence, our name.”<\/p>\nFounded in 2019, Pipedream is akin to workflow automation platforms like Zapier, Integromat, Workato and MuleSoft — albeit more developer-focused. Any user, customer, or partner can add an integration to the close-sourced portion of the platform, while developers can add proprietary or internal integrations that aren’t intended to be shared with the larger Pipedream community. For example, Sacerdoti says that many customers use Pipedream to interact with existing AI platforms, building integrations to leverage AI models such as OpenAI’s GPT-3 or a cloud service AI product from Google, Microsoft or AWS.<\/p>\nAs of today, which marks the general release of the latest version of the Pipedream platform, customers get data stores to store and retrieve data across steps and workflows and single sign-on support.<\/p>"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n“A huge percentage of the software engineering being done today is integrating APIs, often called ‘glue code,'” Sacerdoti said. “Data engineering teams are nearly universally under-staffed and engineering leadership wants those teams working on the highest value parts of the business that only they can work on. Integrations rarely clear this bar and, as a result, integrations often don\u2019t get prioritized. As enterprises look for automation and efficiencies, integrations are one of the most impactful and profitable efforts they can take.”<\/p>\nPipedream has a number of competitors in the workflow automation space, chiefly Zapier and the aforementioned FaaS products. Newer players include"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/26\/n8n-raises-12m-for-its-fair-code-approach-to-low-code-workflow-automation\/\">n8n<\/a>, which provides a framework for users to synchronize data and workflows, and"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/17\/merge-raises-4-5m-to-help-b2b-companies-build-customer-facing-integrations\/\">Merge<\/a>, which helps its users build customer-facing integrations with third-party tools.<\/p>\nBut Pipedream’s business is booming nevertheless. Sacerdoti claims that the company has more than 100 customers, including Checkr and Scale AI, and sees more than 600 developers sign up every day. Sacerdoti attributes part of the growth to the number of triggers and actions on Pipedream’s platform (thousands), which he believes positions the platform well against rivals.<\/p>\n"attachment_2315831\" style=\"width: 1810px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">"caption-attachment-2315831\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2315831 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Pipedream_1.png\" alt=\"Pipedream\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1757\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Pipedream_1.png 1800w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Pipedream_1.png?resize=150,146 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Pipedream_1.png?resize=300,293 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Pipedream_1.png?resize=768,750 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Pipedream_1.png?resize=680,664 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Pipedream_1.png?resize=1536,1499 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Pipedream_1.png?resize=32,32 32w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Pipedream_1.png?resize=50,50 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1800px) 100vw, 1800px\" \/>"caption-attachment-2315831\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image Credits:<\/strong> Pipedream<\/p><\/div><\/p>\nIt’s no coincidence that Pipedream’s success comes amid explosive growth in API — and software-as-a-service (SaaS) app — usage.

Graduates of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), the founders created a platform that leverages AI and hardhat-mounted 360-degree cameras to capture images of ongoing construction projects during site inspections.<\/p>\n"ltr\">Buildots today announced that it raised $60 million in a Series C round co-led by Viola Growth and Eyal Ofer\u2019s O.G. Tech, with participation from TLV Partners, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Future Energy Ventures and Maor Investments. Danon says the new capital, which brings Buildots’ total raised to $106 million, will be put toward product development and expanding the Buildots team, particularly in Europe and North America.<\/p>\n"ltr\">“The construction industry has been going through major transformation over the past few years,” Danon told TechCrunch in an email interview. “Drivers of this change include rising demand for new commercial and residential projects, increasing complexity of these projects, and manpower shortage. Traditionally, contractors have suffered from low profit margins, but Buildots\u2019 solution is leading the charge to connect data to decision-making so that they can maximize revenue.”<\/p>\n"ltr\">The seed of the idea for Buildots came in 2017, 10 years after Danon, Leibovici and Sudry met in the IDF’s elite Talpiot unit. Without prior experience in or knowledge of the construction industry, the trio spent six months researching projects to better understand the challenges that construction companies and contractors face.<\/p>\n"speakable-summary\">"attachment_2317000\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">"caption-attachment-2317000\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2317000\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/buildots.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"Buildots\" width=\"680\" height=\"383\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/buildots.jpg 1920w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/buildots.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/buildots.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/buildots.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/buildots.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/buildots.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/buildots.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/>"caption-attachment-2317000\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image Credits:<\/strong> Buildots<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n"ltr\">Buildots analyzes project schedules, designs and other data to generate a model of an active construction site. When workers equip their hardhats with a compatible 360-degree camera and upload the footage to Buildots, the platform automatically compares features of the site — e.g. pipes under a kitchen sink — to the model to gauge progress, automatically blurring out people in the footage for compliance purposes.<\/p>"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n"ltr\">“Having operated in numerous and diverse regions, including North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and the Middle East, we have collected varied datasets that allow us to create extremely robust AI models,” Danon said. “For example, when a solution looks at hundreds of millions of sockets, it gets really good at recognizing issues and flagging mistakes. While most items look similar between construction sites, there\u2019s always that one client that decides to put a pink cubicle toilet that challenges our models at first glance.”<\/p>\n"ltr\">Buildots’ two-way integrations with planning platforms Oracle Primavera P6, Asta Powerproject and Microsoft Project are designed to allow instant timeline updates. Monthly progress reports, meanwhile, ostensibly help to validate subcontractor payment applications.<\/p>\n"ltr\">“Increasing visibility helps decision-makers reduce risk, improve cash flow, and save significant time,” Danon added. “[This gives] them the confidence to know their projects are being carried out as planned and in the most efficient way possible.”<\/p>\n"ltr\">Of course, Buildots isn’t the only company applying AI in the construction domain.

According to a recent Fivetran"https:\/\/www.businesswire.com\/news\/home\/20220511005403\/en\/Over-80-Percent-of-Companies-Rely-on-Stale-Data-for-Decision-Making\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">survey<\/a>, 82% of companies are making decisions based on stale information, 85% of which say is leading to incorrect decisions and lost revenue.<\/p>\nWith the popularization of real-time database technologies, stale data and the problems surrounding it might soon become a thing of the past — if vendors’ sales pitches are to be believed. Real-time databases can deliver insights immediately, in theory, enabling companies to address line-of-business issues as they come up and act on short-term changes.<\/p>\nAs evidenced by the larger and larger funding tranches, investors believe that there’s a sizeable market for real-time databases. Last September,"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/09\/08\/real-time-database-platform-singlestore-raises-80m-more-now-at-a-940m-valuation\/\">SingleStore<\/a>, which provides a platform to help enterprises integrate, monitor and query their data as a single entity, raised $80 million in a financing round.

Co-founder and CEO Fangjin Yang says that the new money will be put toward product development and expanding the company’s workforce from 200 employees to 300 by the end of the year.<\/p>\n"attachment_2319290\" style=\"width: 3098px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">"caption-attachment-2319290\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2319290 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1568053570-fallback.jpg\" alt=\"Imply\" width=\"3088\" height=\"1790\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1568053570-fallback.jpg 3088w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1568053570-fallback.jpg?resize=150,87 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1568053570-fallback.jpg?resize=300,174 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1568053570-fallback.jpg?resize=768,445 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1568053570-fallback.jpg?resize=680,394 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1568053570-fallback.jpg?resize=1536,890 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1568053570-fallback.jpg?resize=2048,1187 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1568053570-fallback.jpg?resize=50,29 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 3088px) 100vw, 3088px\" \/>"caption-attachment-2319290\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Imply’s Apache Druid-powered query view.

The first wave in the 2000s was trying to solve the large-scale data processing and storage challenges, which [tools like] HDFS, MapReduce, and Spark addressed,” Yang told TechCrunch in an email interview. “The second wave in the 2010s was then trying to solve the problem of large-scale query processing, which created the emergence of cloud data warehouses (e.g., Snowflake, Redshift, and BigQuery) and distributed SQL engines (e.g., Impala, Presto, Athena). Now, the challenge organizations are trying to solve are large scale analytics applications enabling interactive data experiences. That\u2019s where … Imply comes in.”<\/p>\nBurlingame, California-based Imply was founded in 2015 by Yang, Gian Merlino and Vadim Ogievetsky. Yang was an R&D engineer at Cisco focusing on optimization algorithms for networking, while Merlino was a server software developer at Yahoo (full disclosure: TechCrunch’s parent company).<\/p>"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\nYang, Merlino and Ogievetsky met at Metamarkets, an analytics platform for programmatic advertising that was"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/11\/03\/snap-metamarkets\/\">acquired<\/a> by Snap in 2017. While at Metamarkets, they developed Druid, an open source, distributed data store written in Java that uses a cluster of specialized processes to analyze high volumes of real-time and historical data.<\/p>\nDruid — which is currently used in production by companies including Netflix, Salesforce and Confluent — moved to an Apache license in 2015.<\/p>\n“What\u2019s consistent across companies using Druid … is their ability to unlock more value from data, specifically real-time, streaming events,” Yang said. “Where cloud data warehouses are for reports and dashboards described by infrequent queries by a handful of analysts, Druid enables analytics applications that power interactive, live conversations with data with a limitless number of internal stakeholders and external customers at instant query response times.”<\/p>\nImply builds fully managed databases using Druid. Moreover, Yang positions Imply as the “enterprise version” of Druid, providing ostensibly more capabilities and services than the standalone Druid project. For example, Imply recently launched Polaris, a cloud database service designed to simplify streaming, visualization, and other aspects of real-time analytics.<\/p>\n“From a business standpoint, the need for data-driven insights and applications has increased due changes brought about by the pandemic, which in turn has increased the need for Imply\u2019s technology,” Yang said. “[I]nsights are no longer confined to a predefined set of queries in a report. Organizations can now take real-time and historical events at tremendous scale (e.g., clickstream data, cloud application and services metrics, and internet of things telemetry) for operational intelligence, for real-time recommendations, and for extending insights to their customers.”<\/p>\n"embed breakout\">\n"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"GuS9MQFl2V\">"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/05\/16\/start-up-solo-or-bring-on-a-co-founder-4-factors-to-consider\/\">Start up solo or bring on a co-founder? 4 factors to consider<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"“Start up solo or bring on a co-founder? 4 factors to consider” — TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/05\/16\/start-up-solo-or-bring-on-a-co-founder-4-factors-to-consider\/embed\/#?secret=zCvYcmhESv#?secret=GuS9MQFl2V\" data-secret=\"GuS9MQFl2V\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\nImply stands to gain as enterprises increasingly favor the cloud for database management.

Imply has competition in alternative databases and data warehouses like PostgreSQL, Snowflake, Elastic, and Clickhouse, but Yang asserts that the startup is sufficiently differentiated by its high concurrency and “value” — particularly in the areas of streaming and batch data.<\/p>\nBarring thorough comparisons of each platform, we’ll have to take Yang’s word for it. But for what it’s worth, Imply claims to have over 150 customers, including Atlassian, Cisco ThousandEyes, InterContinental Exchange and Reddit.<\/p>\n“Applications built on Imply\u2019s database are accessed by many thousands of users,” said Yang, who demurred when asked about Imply’s current revenue. “Druid is unlocking a whole new world of analytics use cases, and it\u2019s creating tremendous value for organizations as they undergo digital transformations.”<\/p>\nTo date, Imply has raised $215 million in venture capital.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"The desire to extract value from enterprise data has only grown as the pandemic prompts organizations to digitize their operations.

Team is the core unit of work of the knowledge economy, and yet had never been productized in the world of online work.”<\/p>\n"speakable-summary\">"attachment_2318672\" style=\"width: 2230px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">"caption-attachment-2318672\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2318672 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/60aee46d35df4af311836785_team-management-main-image.png\" alt=\"A.Team\" width=\"2220\" height=\"1628\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/60aee46d35df4af311836785_team-management-main-image.png 2220w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/60aee46d35df4af311836785_team-management-main-image.png?resize=150,110 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/60aee46d35df4af311836785_team-management-main-image.png?resize=300,220 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/60aee46d35df4af311836785_team-management-main-image.png?resize=768,563 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/60aee46d35df4af311836785_team-management-main-image.png?resize=680,499 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/60aee46d35df4af311836785_team-management-main-image.png?resize=1536,1126 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/60aee46d35df4af311836785_team-management-main-image.png?resize=2048,1502 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/60aee46d35df4af311836785_team-management-main-image.png?resize=50,37 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2220px) 100vw, 2220px\" \/>"caption-attachment-2318672\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Building product teams with A.Team.
Image Credits:<\/strong> A.Team<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n"ltr\">Ouzan claims that A.Team, which today emerged from stealth with $60 million in funding, differs from traditional gig platforms in that it “bring[s] world-class product builders together as cloud-based teams and connect[s] them with companies that had meaningful product missions.” That’s a lot of jargon and positive framing, but the crux is that A.Team helps companies assemble teams of vetted specialists to design and\/or bring products to market.<\/p>\n"ltr\">A.Team launched at the start of the pandemic, when crippling layoffs were hitting the tech industry. Ouzan says that thousands of engineers, designers and product managers signed up to build products, including mask distribution, contact tracing and vaccine manufacturing software.<\/p>"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n"ltr\">The normalization of remote work fueled growth, too, as product specialists were increasingly able to work from home. “We\u2019d never publicly launched A.Team as a company, but grew to a [referral- and] members-only network of over 250 clients and 4,000 builders while still in stealth and invite-only over the past two years — all through word-of-mouth,” Ouzan said. “We started enabling product builders to team up with their peers to work on problems that matter to them while enjoying full autonomy and income.”<\/p>\n"ltr\">Fascinatingly, A.Team leveraged its own network in combination with a full-time staff to build and expand the A.Team platform. A.Team’s contractors and full-timers created what Ouzan called the TeamGraph, which takes into account a gig candidate’s work experience and “behavioral analytics” to piece together product teams for companies. The TeamGraph is a semantic graph that attempts to establish the relationships between industry experience, skills, roles and expertise, pulling data from a range of sources and using machine learning to optimize the graph with inputs from A.Team’s Team Pulse feature. Team Pulse enables customers to rate the A.Team members they\u2019re working with and members to rate each other — honestly and not maliciously, one would hope.<\/p>\n"ltr\">“Our algorithm can … learn what [A. Team users are] interested in based on behavioral data, not just self-reported data. Think of it like a smart inbox for teams and missions,” Ouzan said. “With TeamGraph, we don\u2019t recommend people for roles \u2014 we recommend teams for missions. We mitigate bias in our recommendations by ensuring the algorithm is blind to any demographic or location data.”<\/p>\n"ltr\">Like any other jobs platform, A.Team also provides recommendations to gig searchers and teams, leaning on connections, complementary skill sets, and projects to identify top matches.<\/p>\n"ltr\">“A.Team is popularizing the concept of elastic resourcing by way of cloud-based teams, which will make companies and builders more resilient to potential market downswings. It\u2019s a smarter way to scale for growth,” Ouzan argues. “The power dynamics have changed, and the best and a lot of the top tech talent in the world want the freedom and flexibility to work on what matters to them, not the rigid structures of a full-time job.”<\/p>\n"attachment_2318671\" style=\"width: 1544px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">"caption-attachment-2318671\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2318671 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/624520dcacdce298564a5bae_how-it-works-2.png\" alt=\"A.Team\" width=\"1534\" height=\"940\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/624520dcacdce298564a5bae_how-it-works-2.png 1534w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/624520dcacdce298564a5bae_how-it-works-2.png?resize=150,92 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/624520dcacdce298564a5bae_how-it-works-2.png?resize=300,184 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/624520dcacdce298564a5bae_how-it-works-2.png?resize=768,471 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/624520dcacdce298564a5bae_how-it-works-2.png?resize=680,417 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/624520dcacdce298564a5bae_how-it-works-2.png?resize=50,31 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1534px) 100vw, 1534px\" \/>"caption-attachment-2318671\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image Credits:<\/strong> A.Team<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n"ltr\">The evidence is mixed on this. While it’s true that many"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/people-quit-full-time-jobs-for-contract-gigs-and-make-six-figures-great-resignation-11647291183\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">professionals<\/a> quit full-time jobs for contract work during the pandemic, particularly in project management and consulting,"http:\/\/b2b-assets.glassdoor.com\/benefits-employees-want-most-2017.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">surveys<\/a> show that the benefits and perks that come along with salaried work remain highly desirable. As for whether a greater reliance on contract workers can insulate companies against economic headwinds, that’s proven to be untrue in certain industries, like health care, which during the pandemic paid contractors"https:\/\/www.healthcarefinancenews.com\/news\/hospitals-paying-24-billion-more-labor-during-covid-19-pandemic\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">significantly more<\/a> than full-time workers to address staffing shortfalls.<\/p>\n"ltr\">Ouzan asserts that the tech industry is somewhat unique in its orientation around product lifecycles, which call for niche expertise. In addition to bringing products from ideation to production, companies can use A.Team to inject missing skills into product teams, he says, or deliver supplementary teams to work on additional lines of business.<\/p>\n"ltr\">There’s interest in A.Team, clearly, with 25 new company clients joining the platform per month. Revenue grew 7.4x in 2021 and gross merchandise value (e.g. total revenue from sales) recently crossed $42 million, according to Ouzan, thanks to a customer base that includes McGraw Hill and The Economist. But as A.Team prepares to onboard 100 new companies per month, it remains to be seen whether the flexibility — and pay, for that matter — will continue to attract workers to the platform. It’s often a delicate balancing act with gig marketplaces. For example, early on in the pandemic, a"https:\/\/time.com\/5836868\/gig-economy-coronavirus\/\">flood<\/a> of newly jobless employees cut deeply into gig worker incomes.<\/p>\n"ltr\">“Through modular, cloud-based teams, we\u2019re empowering companies to elastically scale up and down their product resources based on the mission at hand and stage of product development,” Ouzan said. “A.Team is an entirely new way of working for the top product builders that have left FAANG companies and want the freedom to work on meaningful product missions with teammates they love. They work in teams on missions that last 12 to 19 months on average, and make $130 per hour on average. Making $100,000 a year on Fiverr is the outlier; at A.Team, it’s the starting point.”<\/p>\n"ltr\">A.Team’s funding came from a $55 million Series A round co-led by Tiger Global Management, Insight Partners and Spruce Capital Partners, and a previously undisclosed $5 million seed round. The seed round was led by NFX, joined by Box Group, Village Global and firstminute Capital, with participation from (unsurprisingly) a former Upwork CEO and co-founder of Fiverr.<\/p>\n"ltr\">Ouzan says that the capital will be put toward expanding the core A.Team platform and creating an ecosystem of independent product builders, companies, partners and investors. The company currently employs 75 people between staffers and contractors and expects to grow that number to 170 by 2022.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"The gig economy has, to use a well-worn word, disrupted industries from ride-hailing to quick-service restaurants.

August 2021 Gallup"https:\/\/news.gallup.com\/poll\/353312\/consumers-felt-supply-chain-problems.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">survey<\/a> saying that they’ve been unable to get a product they wanted in the past two months because of shortages. Bearing the brunt of the impact is the fashion industry, which employs millions of workers at retail stores, suppliers and manufacturing factories around the world. Bangladesh, one of the largest exporters of ready-made garments, saw export earnings plunge from $34.13 billion in 2018 to less than $28 billion in 2020 as Western brands wrestled with pandemic-related border restrictions.<\/p>\n"http:\/\/Fashinza.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fashinza<\/a>, a Gurgaon, India-based supply chain “marketplace” for fashion brands and retailers, was co-founded months before the disruptions. But CEO Pawan Gupta says that the platform was designed to handle exactly these types of supply chain challenges by providing"font-weight: 400;\"> access to fulfillment options that wouldn’t normally be available to international companies.<\/span><\/p>\n"font-weight: 400;\">“While exploring [the] business-to-consumer fashion ecommerce [industry], we were shocked by the serpentine supply chains,” Gupta, who co-launched Fashinza with <\/span>"font-weight: 400;\">Abhishek Sharma and Jamil Ahmad, told TechCrunch via email. <\/span>"font-weight: 400;\">“Even though brands were marking up their retail price at 75% to 80% margins, they were still making only around 8% to 10% profits and losing money due to high inventory wastage or going out of stock. [They] struggled with … opacity due to multiple middlemen and their manufacturers being thousands of miles away.”<\/span><\/p>\n"font-weight: 400;\">Gupta describes Fashinza’s product as “design to delivery” in the sense that it lets brands not only find manufacturers and place bulk orders, but analyze trending designs in fashion. Customers can also use Fashinza to track time and action calendars, a tool used in the apparel industry to follow up on manufacturing milestones to ensure timely delivery.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n"attachment_2312197\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">"caption-attachment-2312197\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2312197\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/techpack.png\" alt=\"Fashinza\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1235\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/techpack.png 2720w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/techpack.png?resize=124,150 124w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/techpack.png?resize=249,300 249w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/techpack.png?resize=768,926 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/techpack.png?resize=564,680 564w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/techpack.png?resize=1274,1536 1274w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/techpack.png?resize=1698,2048 1698w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/techpack.png?resize=41,50 41w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/>"caption-attachment-2312197\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Fashinza’s B2B supply chain marketplace.

The software tracks the lifecycles of garments and uses the data to train algorithms for matching brands with suppliers, Gupta said, and predicting metrics like turnaround time.<\/span><\/p>\nIn an endorsement of"font-weight: 400;\">Fashinza’s approach to supply chain management<\/span>, the company today announced that it raised $100 million in Series B funding ($60 million in equity and $40 million in debt) co-led by"font-weight: 400;\">Prosus Ventures and Westbridge, with participation from Accel, Elevation and ADQ at a $300 billion valuation. The round brings Fashinza’s total raised to $135 million, which Gupta says is being used to refine the company’s supply chain technology and expand into new markets, including raw materials procurement.<\/span><\/p>"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n“"font-weight: 400;\">Business-to-business marketplaces are here to stay. We can\u2019t imagine a world where, even in 2030, brands would need to make 100 calls, send 200 emails, and wait for six months for [a] bulk order,” Gupta said. “The entire experience is broken and doesn\u2019t work in this fast-paced world. But the solutions … need to be vertical and very customized to … industries.”<\/span><\/p>\nAn expanding market<\/h2>\n"font-weight: 400;\">Prior to starting Fashinza, Gupta co-founded Curofy, a social networking app for doctors, while <\/span>"font-weight: 400;\">Sharma previously helped to found e-commerce retailer OfferBean. Together with Ahmad, they launched Fashinza in 2020, which now employs a workforce of 200 people. Gupta expects headcount to expand to 250 by the end of the year.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n"font-weight: 400;\">Fashinza makes money by charging suppliers a “usage-based” fee on every order and by providing value-added services like logistics, fintech and business-to-business payments to both brands and manufacturers. Gupta asserts that Fashinza is able to achieve cost savings by <\/span>"font-weight: 400;\">improving the unit economics on the supply side, leveraging “unutilized capacity” and “improving production efficiency” through tech and data.<\/span><\/p>\nCertainly,"font-weight: 400;\">Fashinza has no shortage of competition in a supply chain management market that Statista"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/1181996\/supply-chain-management-market-size-worldwide\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">predicts<\/a> could be worth $30.91 billion by 2026, up from $19.58 billion in 2022.

One of these vendors is"https:\/\/www.keelvar.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Keelvar<\/a>, a Cork, Ireland-based supply chain analytics platform that weighs different sourcing scenarios to guide customers to decisions for their supply chains.<\/p>\nKeelvar is headed by Alan Holland, who left his position as a lecturer in AI at the University of College Cork to found the startup in 2012.<\/p>\n“My goal was to use my specialist knowledge in optimization, game theory, and mechanism design to commercialize advances in AI for procurement teams,” Holland told TechCrunch in an email interview. “[O]ur solutions have helped our customers adapt to ever more volatile conditions, notably in the transportation market, where our [platform has] allowed customers to source efficiently in an adverse environment.”<\/p>\nOrganizations that rely on the supply chain, which is practically all of them, engage in a process called procurement. Procurement entails acquiring goods and services from suppliers who typically compete for business by submitting bids that companies evaluate. Suppliers with the most attractive bid are awarded a contract, the terms of which are subject to negotiation.<\/p>\n"attachment_2319121\" style=\"width: 2542px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">"caption-attachment-2319121\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2319121 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/61a9f661e073617445e35202_Website-header-2x-v2.png\" alt=\"Keelvar\" width=\"2532\" height=\"1754\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/61a9f661e073617445e35202_Website-header-2x-v2.png 2532w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/61a9f661e073617445e35202_Website-header-2x-v2.png?resize=150,104 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/61a9f661e073617445e35202_Website-header-2x-v2.png?resize=300,208 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/61a9f661e073617445e35202_Website-header-2x-v2.png?resize=768,532 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/61a9f661e073617445e35202_Website-header-2x-v2.png?resize=680,471 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/61a9f661e073617445e35202_Website-header-2x-v2.png?resize=1536,1064 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/61a9f661e073617445e35202_Website-header-2x-v2.png?resize=2048,1419 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/61a9f661e073617445e35202_Website-header-2x-v2.png?resize=50,35 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2532px) 100vw, 2532px\" \/>"caption-attachment-2319121\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Evaluating procurement bids with Keelvar.
Image Credits:<\/strong> Keelvar<\/p><\/div><\/p>\nKeelvar allows customers to canvass an array of direct and indirect procurement bid information from suppliers and then analyze multiple awarding scenarios based on those criteria and other constraints. (Direct procurement is spending on goods and services that drive tangible profit, whereas indirect procurement is spending on goods and services needed for day-to-day operations.) Using the platform, they can also launch and run new bidding events. Algorithms sort through data on supply chain disruptions and vendors, cleansing it and extracting information before offering recommendations.<\/p>"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\nDuring the pandemic, Holland said that pharmaceutical companies used Keelvar to spot bad actors and inflated prices in the supply chain, and responded by rerouting goods through other means of transportation (e.g., via ground instead of air).<\/p>\n“AI-powered sourcing bots are essentially agents designed to execute several tasks and reason about inputs they receive, such as identifying suppliers to invite to a bidding event, managing supplier communications and bid analysis, and recommending award decisions,” Keelvar explains on its website. “[The]"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">bots can establish spot bidding or mini-tender events within a matter of minutes, managing and automating mundane tasks such as inviting carriers, collecting and validating bid data, messaging bid status updates, conducting necessary rate card and lane information lookups, and generating award recommendations.”<\/span><\/p>\nVenture capitalists see the opportunity in the supply chain. Last year was a banner year, when VCs put $11.3 billion in financing toward vendors in the sector,"https:\/\/news.crunchbase.com\/news\/supply-chain-vc-startup-funding\/\">according<\/a> to Crunchbase. Keelvar is a beneficiary, having today closed a $24 million Series B funding round led by 83North with participation from Elephant, Mosaic, and Paua.<\/p>\n“Enterprises were blindsided when the pandemic shut down the global supply chain. As issues persist and show no sign of relenting, C-suites are finally recognizing that intelligent automation is a must-have,” 83North partner Philip Chopin said in a statement. “Keelvar\u2019s unique automation and optimization solutions empower procurement teams by helping them easily define their needs and react faster to market changes. The company\u2019s blue-chip customer list and incredible retention and satisfaction rates are a powerful testament to their technology, team, and vision.”<\/p>\nKeelvar competes with a number of companies in the procurement solutions space, including Fairmarkit, Tealbook, and"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/28\/contingent-fundraise\/\">Contingent<\/a>. But while remaining vague about Keelvar’s technological advantages, as well as revenue, Holland pointed to the company’s overall growth in recent months. Keelvar, which plans to expand its 85-person headcount to over 130 by the end of the year, currently has over 70 enterprise customers and “thousands” of paying users.<\/p>\n“[Recently,] we\u2019ve significantly expanded our customer base and team, as well as successfully launched [air] and ocean bots for sourcing automations,” Holland said. “We\u2019ve [also] successfully grown as a remote-first organization, doubling our workforce.”<\/p>\nThe Series B brings Keelvar’s total raised to $43 million.

platform, today announced that it raised $16 million in a Series B round led by Five Elms Capital with participation from"font-weight: 400;\">Grayhawk Capital, Next Frontier Capital, Peninsula Ventures, Kickstart Fund and Silverton Partners<\/span>. CEO Verl Allen says that the new money, which brings the company’s total raised to $27.9 million, will be used to double Claravine’s headcount to 88 employees by the end of the year and support product R&D.<\/p>\n"font-weight: 400;\">Claravine was founded in 2012 as Tracking First, a company focused on streamlining the tracking code process for large organizations. Tracking code is a snippet of code that tracks the activity of a website visitor by collecting data and sending it to an analytics module, usually for marketing purposes.<\/span><\/p>\nAccording to Allen, Tracking First had “gritty founders” who “knew the space well” and had “high-quality” customers, but the focus was too narrow. “T"font-weight: 400;\">here was a realization that there was a bigger underlying problem that was being ignored in the market, which our solution had the potential to address,” Allen told TechCrunch in an email interview. “In 2018, I joined as CEO and helped the organization — now Claravine — to grow and expand the ways we could help the largest organizations in the world take a proactive approach to their data.”<\/span><\/p>\nClaravine’s product is designed to"font-weight: 400;\"> help enterprises control what flows through their tech stack, especially business intelligence and analytics software, and manage their marketing data standards — the blueprints for defining common formats for data across regions, teams and campaigns<\/span>"font-weight: 400;\">. Via an API and integrations with platforms including Adobe Experience Manager and Workfront as well as media platforms like Google Ads, Claravine supports <\/span>"font-weight: 400;\">teams in managing parameters of these standards over time.<\/span><\/p>\n"font-weight: 400;\">“[F]or many organizations, decision-makers have to rely on untrustworthy data for business decisions … [These] d<\/span>"font-weight: 400;\">ecision-makers rely not just on technologies and data but humans, and that creates a large possibility for error in the data entry process, exacerbated by all the disconnected technologies and teams,” Allen said. “This <\/span>"font-weight: 400;\">is why our solution is built to engrain standards into the way business teams work and collaborate as they create and modify data. By facilitating a common understanding of standards as inputs are generated and reviewed, organizations have greater control early on, whatever their needs. And downstream data users can move with more confidence and speed when using this data to make decisions.”<\/span><\/p>\n"attachment_2318000\" style=\"width: 3210px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">"caption-attachment-2318000\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2318000 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/User-adobe.png\" alt=\"Claravine\" width=\"3200\" height=\"2146\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/User-adobe.png 3200w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/User-adobe.png?resize=150,101 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/User-adobe.png?resize=300,201 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/User-adobe.png?resize=768,515 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/User-adobe.png?resize=680,456 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/User-adobe.png?resize=1536,1030 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/User-adobe.png?resize=2048,1373 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/User-adobe.png?resize=50,34 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 3200px) 100vw, 3200px\" \/>"caption-attachment-2318000\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Claravine’s data management platform.
Image Credits:<\/strong> Claravine<\/p><\/div><\/p>\nToward this end, Claravine provides a dashboard where companies can build taxonomies using descriptions, lists, values and referenceable fields. Using the platform, a user can bring in a tracking code dataset, for example, and standardize it — automatically verifying that no information is missing. Claravine also offers consulting services to assist companies with evaluating the current state of their data standards. For a fee, staffers outline alternative approaches, recording things like naming conventions, rules and custom attributes in a central location for reference.<\/p>"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n"font-weight: 400;\">“Data standards enable organizations to build a solid foundation of data by reducing human error upfront and unlocking a greater depth and breadth of data for use … By <\/span>"font-weight: 400;\">building in data integrity early on and pushing this data into core systems including cloud storage, you give back time to downstream teams otherwise lost to cleaning and translating,” Allen said.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\nAllen sees Claravine’s main competition as spreadsheet-based"font-weight: 400;\">processes, internally built worklows and — increasingly — no-code apps. While he admits it can be difficult to convince teams to manage their data standards in a platform as opposed to siloed solutions, he argues that the cost of not doing so is too high. <\/span><\/p>\n"font-weight: 400;\">Underlining Allen’s point, a recent Gartner"https:\/\/www.gartner.com\/en\/newsroom\/press-releases\/gartner-marketing-survey-finds-only-14--of-organizations-have-ac\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">survey<\/a> found that only 14% of companies have achieved what they consider to be a “360-degree view” of their customer, owing to poor-quality data and other organizational hurdles.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n"font-weight: 400;\">“While some organizations may try to define and distribute data requirements in documents, structured spreadsheets or homegrown solutions, these create immense challenges around change management, version control, access, and process resulting in challenges in the readiness and reliability of data, particularly for global organizations,” Allen said. “<\/span>"font-weight: 400;\">The status quo for marketing operations, measurement, and data teams is no longer good enough.”<\/span><\/p>\nMum’s the word on Claravine’s annual recurring revenue (ARR) — Allen declined to say — but the startup has close to 100 customers, including Under Armour, Ancestry and Vanguard. From 2020 to 2021,"font-weight: 400;\">Allen says that Claravine saw over 40% ARR growth and 95% gross revenue retention, which refers to the percentage of recurring revenue retained from existing customers, including cancellations.<\/span><\/p>\n"font-weight: 400;\">“Claravine has carved out a new category that continues to redefine how top brands manage their digital experience. We have been exceptionally impressed by Verl, his team, and their mission<\/span>"font-weight: 400;\">,” Stephanie Schneider, a partner at Five Elms Capital, told TechCrunch via email when contacted for comment. “Claravine is positioned to become a dominant player in the space as it continues to scale its platform and offerings.

raises $20M to simplify Kubernetes container management"},"content":{"rendered":""speakable-summary\">"http:\/\/akuity.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Akuity<\/a>, a provider of app delivery software for Kubernetes, today announced that it closed a $20 million Series A funding round led by Lead Edge Capital and Decibel Partners, bringing Akuity’s total raised to $25 million. Co-founder and CEO Hong Wang says that the funding will enable Akuity to expand the size of its workforce while contributing to the open source community.<\/p>\nApps are increasingly built using containers, or “microservices” packaged with all the necessary dependencies and configuration files. Kubernetes is open source software for deploying and managing these containers. While popular, managing containers with Kubernetes can become complex, particularly as legacy software moves to the cloud as a part of pandemic-prompted digital transformations.
"https:\/\/containerjournal.com\/topics\/container-management\/survey-sees-kubernetes-challenges-taking-a-toll\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">According<\/a> to one recent survey (albeit commissioned by a Kubernetes tooling vendor), over a third of developers and architects admit that Kubernetes has become a major source of burnout.<\/p>\nWang, Jesse Suen and Alexander Matyushentsev believed there must be an easier way. The three were founding engineers at Applatix, a Kubernetes management engine that was acquired by Intuit in 2018. A year earlier, Applatix had open sourced a project called Argo, a “container-native” workflow engine designed to streamline the process of specifying, scheduling and coordinating the running of apps on Kubernetes. While at Intuit following the Applatix acquisition, Wang, Suen and Matyushentsev investigated ways to foster Argo as oversight of the project was transferred to the Linux Foundation.<\/p>\n“Enterprises are well on their way toward containerization. However, as these organizations move to Kubernetes, they quickly discover that their existing, legacy tooling is ill-suited for delivering Kubernetes-native apps with its configuration-heavy design,” Suen told TechCrunch via email. “[W]hile Kubernetes is very powerful, it is extremely complex and provides a poor out-of-the-box developer experience. Because of this, organizations invest in platform and infrastructure teams, as well as developer experience teams, to standardize and ease their transition to Kubernetes. Building these teams is challenging, exacerbated by both high demand and low supply of Kubernetes expertise. Moreover, many of these organizations re-implementing the same patterns again and again and would benefit from a codified set of best practices and standardized tooling.”<\/p>\nSuen and Wang position Argo, and by extension Akuity, as a complement to the traditional continuous delivery (CD) solutions offered by vendors including"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/10\/13\/armory-scores-a-40m-series-c-to-continue-commercializing-open-source-spinnaker-project\/\">Armory<\/a>,"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/06\/27\/cloudbees-raises-62m-for-its-devops-platform\/\">CloudBees<\/a> and"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/14\/harness-snags-85m-series-c-on-1-7b-valuation-as-revenue-grows-3x\/\">Harness.io<\/a>. (In software development, “continuous delivery” refers to the engineering approach where teams create software in short cycles to ensure that it can be reliably released at any time.) Argo allows developers to create a “pipeline” for building apps and specify the pipeline as code, so that it can be built or upgraded using containers and run on other systems.<\/p>\n“Akuity was formed to help companies modernize their Kubernetes tooling, leveraging Argo, the leading open source suite of Kubernetes-native app delivery software,” Wang told TechCrunch in an email interview. “[With Akuity,] we are aiming to revolutionize the DevOps space and provide the most advanced toolset that empowers developers to get the maximum value out of Kubernetes.”<\/p>\nToward that end, Akuity is in the process of launching a fully managed version of Argo called Akuity Platform. Currently in closed beta ahead of general availability later this year, Akuity Platform adds features to Argo like deployment analytics and telemetry, health checks for app components and an audit trail and history of app events and API calls.<\/p>"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n“The number one problem we solve for enterprises is easing their transition to Kubernetes,” Matyushentsev, who recently became chief architect at Akuity, told TechCrunch via email. “With [Akuity,] businesses can enable a high frequency of deployment for quick delivery of new features and updates, decrease [the] lead time for changes and updates, … decrease mean time to recovery to recover quickly, … minimize change failure rate (i.e., the proportion of failures coming from changes), [and] increase the stability and reliability of apps and services.”<\/p>\nIt’s early days for Akuity, which has rivals in container-friendly CD tools like Flux CD and Jenkins X. But Wang pointed to Argo’s uptake as evidence that Akuity has the right approach. Production use of Argo increased by 115% year-over-year, according to a 2021"https:\/\/www.cncf.io\/reports\/cncf-annual-survey-2021\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">survey<\/a> by Cloud Native Computing Foundation, the Linux Foundation overseeing Argo. And since launching last October, Akuity has closed “several” deals with Fortune 1000 companies, Wang claims.<\/p>\nWhether that translates to strong momentum down the road remains to be seen — particularly without revenue numbers to go on. Regardless, it’s true that tooling and services built around Kubernetes represent a massive opportunity. A 2021 poll from Canonical"https:\/\/juju.is\/cloud-native-kubernetes-usage-report-2021\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">found<\/a> that 45.6% of organizations now use Kubernetes in production. A separate report estimates the market for Kubernetes solutions will reach $5.56 billion in 2028, up from $1.71 billion in 2021.<\/p>\n“Our product adoption accelerated during the pandemic,” Wang added. “Based on our conversations with customers, many of them are leveraging the Kubernetes adoption opportunities to refresh their developer tool stack. Argo becomes the default choice as it is Kubernetes-native and has the most vibrant open-source community in the CD space.”<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Akuity, a provider of app delivery software for Kubernetes, today announced that it closed a $20 million Series A funding round led by Lead Edge Capital and Decibel Partners, bringing Akuity’s total raised to $25 million.

machine learning startup headed by LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman and founding DeepMind member Mustafa Suleyman, has secured $225 million in equity

The source of the capital isn’t yet clear — Inflection didn’t immediately respond to a request for more information — but the massive round suggests strong investor confidence in Suleyman, who serves as the company’s CEO.<\/p>\nPalo Alto, California-based Inflection has kept a low profile to date, granting relatively few interviews to the media. But in CNBC"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2022\/01\/28\/mustafa-suleyman-deepmind-co-founder-quits-google-ai-role-to-be-vc.html\">profile<\/a> from January, Suleyman described wanting to build products that eliminate the need for people to simplify their ideas to communicate with machines, with the overarching goal being to leverage AI to help humans “talk” to computers.<\/p>\n“[Programming languages, mice, and other interfaces] are ways we simplify our ideas and reduce their complexity and in some ways their creativity and their uniqueness in order to get a machine to do something,” Suleyman told the publication. “It feels like we\u2019re on the cusp of being able to generate language to pretty much human-level performance. It opens up a whole new suite of things that we can do in the product space.”<\/p>\nThe concept of translating human intentions into a language computers can understand dates back decades. Even the best chatbots and voice assistants today haven\u2019t delivered on the promise, but Suleyman and Hoffman are betting that coming advancements in AI will make an intuitive human-computer interface possible within the next five years.<\/p>\nThey’ll have competition. Just last month,"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/04\/26\/2304039\/\">Adept<\/a>, a startup co-founded by former DeepMind, OpenAI and Google engineers and researchers, emerged from stealth with a similar concept: AI that can automate any software process. DeepMind itself has"https:\/\/arxiv.org\/pdf\/2202.08137.pdf\">explored<\/a> an approach for teaching AI to control computers, having an AI observe keyboard and mouse commands from people completing “instruction-following” computer tasks, such as booking a flight.<\/p>\nRegardless, the size of Inflection’s funding round reflects the high cost of building sophisticated AI systems. OpenAI is estimated to have spent millions of dollars developing GPT-3, the company’s system that can generate human-like text given a prompt.

artificial general intelligence (AGI), or the ability to understand and learn any task that a human can. Long relegated to the domain of science fiction, it’s been suggested that AGI would bring about systems with the ability to reason, plan, learn, represent knowledge and communicate in natural language.<\/p>\nNot every expert is convinced that AGI is a realistic goal — or even possible. But it could be argued that DeepMind, the Alphabet-backed research lab, took a step toward it this week with the release of an AI system called"https:\/\/www.deepmind.com\/publications\/a-generalist-agent\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Gato<\/a>.<\/p>\nGato is what DeepMind describes as a “general-purpose” system, a system that can be taught to perform many different types of tasks. Researchers at DeepMind trained Gato to complete 604, to be exact, including captioning images, engaging in dialogue, stacking blocks with a real robot arm and playing Atari games.<\/p>\n“Most current AI systems work on a single task or narrow domain at a time. The significance of this work is mainly that one agent with one [model] can do hundreds of very different tasks, including to control a real robot and do basic captioning and chat,” Scott Reed, a researcher scientist at DeepMind and one of the co-creators of Gato, told TechCrunch via email.<\/p>\nJack Hessel, a research scientist at the Allen Institute for AI, points out that a single AI system that can solve many tasks isn’t new. For example, Google recently began using a system in Google Search called multitask unified model, or"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/09\/29\/google-introduces-a-new-way-to-search-that-combines-images-and-text-into-one-query\/\">MUM<\/a>, which can handle text, images and videos to perform tasks, from finding interlingual variations in the spelling of a word to relating a search query to an image. But whatis<\/em> potentially newer, here, Hessel says, is the diversity of the tasks that are tackled and the training method.<\/p>\n"attachment_2318161\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">"caption-attachment-2318161\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2318161\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/627d13d743dc353a184da8d4_data_sequences.png?w=680\" alt=\"DeepMind Gato\" width=\"680\" height=\"495\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/627d13d743dc353a184da8d4_data_sequences.png 1299w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/627d13d743dc353a184da8d4_data_sequences.png?resize=150,109 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/627d13d743dc353a184da8d4_data_sequences.png?resize=300,218 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/627d13d743dc353a184da8d4_data_sequences.png?resize=768,559 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/627d13d743dc353a184da8d4_data_sequences.png?resize=680,495 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/627d13d743dc353a184da8d4_data_sequences.png?resize=50,36 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/>"caption-attachment-2318161\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">DeepMind’s Gato architecture.
Image Credits:<\/strong> DeepMind<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n“We’ve seen evidence previously that single models can handle surprisingly diverse sets of inputs,” Hessel told TechCrunch via email. “In my view, the core question when it comes to multitask learning … is whether the tasks complement each other or not. You could envision a more boring case if the model implicitly separates the tasks before solving them, e.g., ‘If I detect task A as an input, I will use subnetwork A. If I instead detect task B, I will use different subnetwork B.’ For that null hypothesis, similar performance could be attained by training A and B separately, which is underwhelming. In contrast, if training A and B jointly leads to improvements for either (or both!), then things are more exciting.”<\/p>"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\nLike all AI systems, Gato learned by example, ingesting billions of words, images from real-world and simulated environments, button presses, joint torques and more in the form of tokens. These tokens served to represent data in a way Gato could understand, enabling the system to — for example — tease out the mechanics of Breakout, or which combination of words in a sentence might make grammatical sense.<\/p>\nGato doesn’t necessarily do these taskswell<\/em>. For example, when chatting with a person, the system often responds with a superficial or factually incorrect reply (e.g. “Marseille” in response to “What is the capital of France?”). In captioning pictures, Gato misgenders people. And the system correctly stacks blocks using a real-world robot only 60% of the time.<\/p>\nBut on 450 of the 604 aforementioned tasks, DeepMind claims that Gato performs better than an expert more than half the time.<\/p>\n“If you’re of the mind that we need general [systems], which is a lot of folks in the AI and machine learning area, then [Gato is] a big deal,” Matthew Guzdial, an assistant professor of computing science at the University of Alberta, told TechCrunch via email. “I think people saying it’s a major step towards AGI are overhyping it somewhat, as we’re still not at human intelligence and likely not to get there soon (in my opinion). I’m personally more in the camp of many small models [and systems] being more useful, but there’s definitely benefits to these general models in terms of their performance on tasks outside their training data.”<\/p>\nCuriously, from an architectural standpoint, Gato isn’t dramatically different from many of the AI systems in production today. It shares characteristics in common with OpenAI’s GPT-3 in the sense that it’s a “Transformer.” Dating back to 2017, the Transformer has become the architecture of choice for complex reasoning tasks, demonstrating an aptitude for summarizing documents, generating music, classifying objects in images and analyzing protein sequences.<\/p>\n"attachment_2318162\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">"caption-attachment-2318162\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2318162\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/ezgif-5-acebdcf906.gif?w=680\" alt=\"DeepMind Gato\" width=\"680\" height=\"680\" \/>"caption-attachment-2318162\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The various tasks that Gato learned to complete.
Image Credits:<\/strong> DeepMind<\/p><\/div><\/p>\nPerhaps even more remarkably, Gato is orders of magnitude smaller than single-task systems, including GPT-3, in terms of the parameter count. Parameters are the parts of the system learned from training data and essentially define the skill of the system on a problem, such as generating text. Gato has just 1.2 billion, while GPT-3 has more than 170 billion.<\/p>\nDeepMind researchers kept Gato purposefully small so the system could control a robot arm in real time. But they hypothesize that — if scaled up — Gato could tackle any “task, behavior, and embodiment of interest.”<\/p>\nAssuming this turns out to be the case, several other hurdles would have to be overcome to make Gato superior in specific tasks to cutting-edge single-task systems, like Gato’s inability to learn continuously. Like most Transformer-based systems, Gato’s knowledge of the world is grounded in the training data and remains static. If you ask Gato a date-sensitive question, like the current president of the U.S., chances are it would respond incorrectly.<\/p>\nThe Transformer — and Gato, by extension — has another limitation in its context window, or the amount of information the system can “remember” in the context of a given task. Even the best Transformer-based language models can’t write a lengthy essay, much less a book, without failing to remember key details and thus losing track of the plot. The forgetting happens in any task, whether writing or controlling a robot, which is why some experts have"https:\/\/venturebeat.com\/2021\/04\/09\/ai-weekly-continual-learning-offers-a-path-toward-more-humanlike-ai\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">called<\/a> it the “Achilles’ heel” of machine learning.<\/p>\nFor these reasons and others, Mike Cook, a member of the Knives & Paintbrushes research collective, cautions against assuming Gato is a path to truly general-purpose AI.<\/p>\n“I think the result is open to misinterpretation, somewhat. It sounds exciting that the AI is able to do all of these tasks that sound very different, because to us it sounds like writing text is very different to controlling a robot. But in reality this isn’t all too different from GPT-3 understanding the difference between ordinary English text and Python code,” Cook told TechCrunch via email. “Gato receives specific training data about these tasks, just like any other AI of its type, and it learns how patterns in the data relate to one another, including learning to associate certain kinds of inputs with certain kinds of outputs. This isn’t to say this is easy, but to the outside observer this might sound like the AI can also make a cup of tea or easily learn another ten or fifty other tasks, and it can’t do that. We know that current approaches to large-scale modelling can let it learn multiple tasks at once. I think it’s a nice bit of work, but it doesn’t strike me as a major stepping stone on the path to anything.”<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"The ultimate achievement to some in the AI industry is creating a system with artificial general intelligence (AGI), or the ability to understand and learn any task that a human can.

raises $25M to automate customer service interactions"},"content":{"rendered":""speakable-summary\">During the pandemic especially, it’s become overwhelming for small- and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) to answer all of their customer service requests. A Freshworks"https:\/\/www.freshworks.com\/assets\/resources\/The-New-CX-Mandate-US-Report.pdf?tactic_id=4098694&utm_source=Email&utm_medium=SM-CX&utm_campaign=New-CX-Mandate-US\">survey<\/a> found that companies experienced a 71% increase in overall contact volume between February 2020 and January 2021, and expect it to increase further. At the same time, customers — while empathetic — have become more demanding. The same poll shows that 68% of customer service managers have seen an increase in customer expectations.<\/p>\nWhat’s a company to do? Automation is one route to more manageable customer experience workloads, potentially. Enter Tidio, a platform that aims to become a one-stop shop for companies corresponding with customers across different channels (e.g., email and SMS). Leveraging a combination of live chat apps and AI-powered chatbots, as well as analytics, Tidio attempts to scale customer service operations even at small companies without the benefit of dedicated staff.<\/p>\nCustomer service automation platforms like Tidio aren’t exactly cutting edge. To name a few, there’s"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/03\/ultimate-ai-scores-20m-for-a-supportive-approach-to-customer-service-automation\/\">Ultimate.ai<\/a>, a data-ingesting, bot-builder platform and"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/11\/05\/ushur-raises-25m-for-its-no-code-platform-to-build-customer-communication-flows\/\">Ushur<\/a>, which offers a service for businesses to create AI-based communication flows. Ada also slots into the category — it features chatbots powered by a natural language processing engine.<\/p>\nWhat makes Tidio stand out, co-founder and CEO Tytus Go\u0142as asserts, is its simplicity in terms of implementation and structure. Tidio integrates with third-party services including email providers, Facebook, Instagram, WordPress and Shopify, allowing teams to manage customer interactions from a shared inbox. Plans range from free for two users to $332.50 per month (billed annually) for unlimited users and other extras.<\/p>\n"attachment_2313990\" style=\"width: 1010px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">"caption-attachment-2313990\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2313990\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/12102e2b69f289090c453e43ce31d18a.gif\" alt=\"Tidio\" width=\"1000\" height=\"514\" \/>"caption-attachment-2313990\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Creating a conversation flow using Tidio’s visual dashboard.

Our impact is twofold — you can streamline communication and increase your sales with our chatbot functionality,” Go\u0142as told TechCrunch in an email interview. “[O]ur chatbots and sales generation features have a direct impact on return on investment and help increase sales and revenue — sometimes covering the entire cost of the Tidio subscription in one day.”<\/p>\nTidio is the brainchild of Go\u0142as and Marcin Wiktor, who co-founded the company in 2013. What started as a digital advertising agency targeted at SMBs evolved into a development house for online marketing tools, one of which was Tidio. After the tool gained traction, Go\u0142as and Wiktor decided to pivot and make it their focus.<\/p>"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\nInvestors endorsed the move. Today, Tidio announced that it raised $25 million in a Series B round led by PeakSpan Capital with participation from Inovo Venture Partners and InPost CEO Rafa\u0142 Brzoska, bringing Tidio’s total raised to $26.8 million,<\/p>\nTidio provides a list of visitors on a company’s website, which owners can use to interact with them in various ways — either in real time (via chat) or automatically (via chatbot). For example, the platform can be programmed to send a “Welcome back” message to a return customer along with a unique discount code. Tidio also captures information like the source of web traffic, the amount of time customers spend on particular webpages and which products are viewed most often.<\/p>\n"ltr\">“We are using our custom dataset and state-of-the-art models to improve the language understanding capabilities of our models,” Go\u0142as said. “[One of these models] automatically detects any question topics in each new chat conversation. The platform then groups the topics by popularity, with the system recommending a user configure their [chatbot] to automate answers to the most common customers’ questions, such as those pertaining to order status, shipping status and returns.”<\/p>\n"ltr\">This type of automation — assuming it works as advertised — can save businesses time on repetitive tasks, Go\u0142as argues, allowing them to focus on building customer relationships.

Historically, the challenge with asynchronous video tools has been user buy-in. It’s easier to fire off a quick Slack message than record and edit a video, after all. But Bubbles attempts to make the process less unappealing by streamlining many aspects of it, dispensing with passwords, onboarding steps and even usernames.<\/span><\/p>"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n"font-weight: 400;\">Users start a Bubbles conversation from a web browser, capturing their perspective through video, audio or a screen recording and inviting collaborators.

But the pandemic increased the workload of support teams, making it more difficult to hire customer service agents and keep the attrition low while maintaining a high bar for customer experience. The"https:\/\/hbr.org\/sponsored\/2021\/08\/heres-what-happens-when-you-focus-on-employees-to-better-serve-your-customers#:~:text=The%20average%20customer%2Dservice%20representative,average%20turnover%20in%20other%20departments.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">average<\/a> contact center turnover rate is as high as 45% — at least twice that of other departments.<\/p>\nThere is no silver bullet. But Jorge Penalva is a strong proponent of using automation technologies to help bridge the gaps in customer service. He would be — he’s the co-founder of"http:\/\/lang.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Lang.ai<\/a>, a startup developing a platform that automatically tags customer conversations to resolve service issues ostensibly more quickly. By applying intelligence to service interactions, Penalva asserts that technology like Lang’s can surface valuable insights to guide product experiences and strategies.<\/p>\n"font-weight: 400;\">“Automation in customer support is not new. As companies grow larger, a common approach is deploying automation via self-service chatbots to grow more efficiently and deflect customer inquiries. Ultimately, the goal of Lang is to be a core layer of the customer experience stack that enables teams to build automations and extract better insights by structuring qualitative data,” Penalva told TechCrunch in an email interview.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\nLang, which today announced that it raised $10.5 million in a Series A funding round led by"font-weight: 400;\">Nava Ventures (bringing its total raised to $15 million), uses AI to extract concepts from customer requests in existing help desk platforms like Zendesk and Intercom. The no-code product appends incoming messages, including emails and texts, with labels like “Talk to agent,” “Delivery issue” and “Platform question.” Using Lang, companies can visually group concepts identified in customer support data and set up automations that trigger with specific labels (e.g. respond to questions about package deliveries with boilerplate text).<\/span><\/p>\n"attachment_2317547\" style=\"width: 593px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">"caption-attachment-2317547\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2317547\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/60f83409a5294bd1516ead0d_tags-banking-services-accounts-credit-cardx2.png?w=583\" alt=\"Lang.ai\" width=\"583\" height=\"680\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/60f83409a5294bd1516ead0d_tags-banking-services-accounts-credit-cardx2.png 956w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/60f83409a5294bd1516ead0d_tags-banking-services-accounts-credit-cardx2.png?resize=128,150 128w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/60f83409a5294bd1516ead0d_tags-banking-services-accounts-credit-cardx2.png?resize=257,300 257w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/60f83409a5294bd1516ead0d_tags-banking-services-accounts-credit-cardx2.png?resize=768,897 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/60f83409a5294bd1516ead0d_tags-banking-services-accounts-credit-cardx2.png?resize=583,680 583w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/60f83409a5294bd1516ead0d_tags-banking-services-accounts-credit-cardx2.png?resize=43,50 43w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 583px) 100vw, 583px\" \/>"caption-attachment-2317547\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image Credits:<\/strong> Lang.ai<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n"font-weight: 400;\">Penalva said that he and his co-founders, Borja Gonz\u00e1lez and Enrique Fueyo Ram\u00edrez, came up with the idea for Lang while working together at a previous startup,"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2015\/03\/18\/sentisis-series-a\/\">Sentisis<\/a>, a natural language processing platform for Spanish. There, Penalva said they saw business teams were unable to leverage customer service data without the expertise of their data science departments, which had higher-priority work on their plates.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n"font-weight: 400;\">“We realized that we had to think about the problem in a completely different way, not by applying current AI models (built for, and by, engineers) and simplifying them for business users, but instead by creating a no-code platform intended, from its inception, for business users,” Penalva said. “<\/span>"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s not just the technology or just the user experience. Both are equally important and that was our ‘aha!’ moment.”<\/span><\/p>"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\nLang isn’t alone in using AI to auto-tag customer service messages. Platforms like Levity.ai and Chatdesk also auto-label incoming service requests, including emails and texts. But"font-weight: 400;\">Penalva believes that Lang is differentiated both by its technology and go-to-market approach. For example, he said, Lang uses AI systems tailored for particular customers’ domains (e.g. retail, food services, healthcare) to recognize industry jargon and adapt to changes like emerging customer support issues. The startup partners with<\/span>"font-weight: 400;\"> vendors developing frontend and backend customer service automation products, such as business intelligence tools, to sell Lang as a complementary offering.<\/span><\/p>\n"font-weight: 400;\">“In making unstructured data usable by tagging it, Lang becomes a data platform that can be leveraged for automations, chatbot workflows and machine learning. <\/span>"font-weight: 400;\">[Moreover, the platform] becomes the system of record for all insights across unstructured customer experience data, providing a centralized source for insights across disparate sources,” Penalva said. <\/span>"font-weight: 400;\">“To date, our biggest competition for budget share has not been other platforms but rather displacing the status quo: the hiring or outsourcing of more customer experience agents.”<\/span><\/p>\nIt’s early days for Lang, but the company counts"font-weight: 400;\">Stitch Fix, Ramp, Hippo Insurance and Freshly among its customers.

On the subject of the former, Penalva says that Lang will work to identify ways to connect support conversations to purchase data to determine, for example, how likely someone with a certain issue will continue purchasing a product. Future versions of the Lang platform will make automation recommendations for customer service teams based on the actions agents commonly perform.<\/p>\n“"font-weight: 400;\">We believe data is the most valuable asset for support and customer experience teams,” Penalva said. “By structuring data in a simple and reliable way across all of their customer interactions, our mission is to help support teams gain their seat at the leadership table, so that support is no longer viewed as a cost center but as a revenue driver.”<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"The customer experience is one of the most important focus areas for businesses.

Cloud Run jobs are designed for containers that run to completion and don’t serve requests, such as data processing and administrative jobs, and when multiple copies of a container must run in parallel.<\/p>\nCloud Run launched in 2019, adding to Google Cloud’s then-rapidly-growing serverless compute stack. As the demand for serverless"https:\/\/www.oreilly.com\/radar\/oreilly-serverless-survey-2019-concerns-what-works-and-what-to-expect\/\">climbs<\/a>, it would appear that expansions like Cloud Run jobs are an attempt to beat back against rivals like Azure and Amazon Web Services.<\/p>\nAvailable in preview starting today, Cloud Run jobs can be used to run a script to perform database migrations or other operational tasks, like sending invoices every month. Relative to other platforms that support long-running jobs, Cloud Run jobs start quickly after creation, Google claims, with simple containers starting in as little as 10 seconds.<\/p>\nTo use Cloud Run jobs, developers create a job, which encapsulates all the configuration needed to run the job including the container image, region, environment variables. Then, they set up the job to run on a schedule or manually run the job, creating a new execution of the job.<\/p>\nDuring the preview, Cloud Run jobs supports up to 50 executions from the same or different jobs concurrently per project per region. Users can view existing jobs, start executions and monitor execution status from Cloud Console’s Cloud Run Jobs page; Cloud Console doesn’t currently support creating new jobs.<\/p>\nCloud Run jobs arrives alongside an updated"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/05\/11\/google-updates-its-firebase-backend-as-a-service-to-make-app-development-faster\/\">Firebase<\/a>, Google’s popular back-end-as-a-service platform, and"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/05\/11\/google-cloud-launches-alloydb-a-new-fully-managed-postgresql-database-service\/\">AlloyDB<\/a>, a new fully managed PostgreSQL database service.
