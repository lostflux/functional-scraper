Will advertisers flee a ‘free speech’ Twitter? – TechCrunch

Will advertisers flee a ‘free speech’ Twitter?IncomingTwitter owner Elon Muskhas emphasized his belief that “free speech” is critical to Twitter’s future, even noting in thepress releaseannouncing the deal today that “free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy.” But there is one significant complication with running an unmoderated (or only lightly moderated) social platform supported by advertisers: and that’s the advertisers themselves. They might leave!If Twitter were to turn back the dials on content moderation, it could allow more bullying, violent speech, hate speech, misinformation and other abusive content to gain ground. This may make Twitter less palatable to newcomers who were already wary about posting in a “public square” — an area that impacts Twitter’songoingconcernswithflatusergrowth. But it could also disincentivize advertisers from investing their budgets with the platform.
Twitter over the years has worked steadily to make the site a less abusive place, to varying degrees of success.
The company has expanded its hate speech rules to include more nuance about what is and is not allowed on the app. In 2020, for example, itadded detail to its ban on dehumanizing speechto include other areas like age, disability and even disease. The latter was a timely addition as some Twitter users had begun making hateful and even racists remarks related to the spread of COVID-19. Last year, it announced it was looking tofurther improve its content moderation systemsby analyzing the reports that users sent in to see where its existing rules could be falling short in terms of user protections. It hastouted in biannual reportswhen its policies helped decrease the amount of hate speech on its platform.
According to its latest, Twittertook action on 4.8 million unique accountsfrom January to June 2021, which includes targeting bots, spam and other bad actors, into addition to rules violations.
With Musk in charge, it’s a wonder where these sorts of efforts may end up. If anything, the pendulum will now swing in the other direction — away from strict moderation. And that could be bad for business.
Twitter accepts Elon Musk’s $44B acquisition offerAdvertisers are fairly allergic to having their brand’s name appear alongside hate speech and abusive or dangerous content on social platforms. They’ve proven this time and time again with boycotts for this specific reason.
In 2017, for example, brands and publishers in Europe said they would pull their advertising dollars from Google’s YouTube after their ads were revealed as being displayed alongside videos promoting terrorism and antisemitism. Google quicklyrespondedto give the advertisers more control over their programmatic buys. And when top YouTube creators stepped out of line at other times, Google would side with the advertisers’ concerns over the matter. The video platform would immediately demonetize andpull ads from any creator experiencing a backlashfor breaching its guidelines over what’s considered “advertiser-friendly” content.
In more recent years, larger advertisers began to throw their weight around inan effort to address Facebook’s content moderation policies. Big-namebrandslike Verizon, Boeing, Microsoft, Reebok, Patagonia, Hershey’s, Eddie Bauer, Adidas, Levi Strauss, Pfizer, HP, Best Buy, Denny’s, Unilever, andothersjoined an advertising boycott of the social network and Instagram in an effort to push Facebook (now called Meta) to increase its enforcement in the area of hate speech.
Yes,increase. Notdecrease.
Here’s Unilver’s statement from that time, to give you an idea: “Based on the current polarization and the election that we are having in the U.S., there needs to be much more enforcement in the area of hate speech.”The company was also boycotting Twitter at the time.
In total, over 1,110 companies including major corporations and small businesses had joined that particular boycott. Other corporations including Coca-Cola, Starbucks, Clorox and Ford also temporarily paused their social ads but didn’t join the full-scale boycott.
Now imagine how these same brands will react if a “free speech” free-for-all really does take place on Twitter. The network, already, isn’t a top priority given its comparatively smaller size relative to others like Facebook, Instagram and TikTok. And if it was home to divisive and dangerous speech? It might just be time to go.
This is not a minor concern for Twitter to weigh as it moves forward. The company has been experimenting with a number of new monetizable products — including Twitter Spaces and subscriptions — but its business today is almost entirely supported via advertising. During its fourth-quarter earnings, Twitter pulled in $1.57 billion in revenue — a miss on expectations of $1.58 billion because ad spending had slowed slightly in the quarter.
Per eMarketer,advertising accounted for 89% of Twitter’s 2021 revenue and it forecast that would grow to above 91% by 2023. Ads are how Twitter even exists.
Twitter does have larger ambitions fordeveloper-led innovationsthat could lead to alternative business models in a distant future, but it’s unclear which projects will survive Twitter’s new priorities.
In other words, advertisers may have a lot of power as Twitter moves forward under Musk. If the company does, in fact, tweak or revamp its moderation policies, reinstate banned users (althoughnot Trump, apparently), or if it allows hate speech and other dangerous and abusive content to return, then advertisers may leave.
Trump says he won’t return to Twitter if his account is reinstatedAnd although Musk may very well be a billionaire, it’s not likely he wants to self-fund Twitter to keep it afloat.
Twitter is due to report its first-quarter earnings on Thursday. But it will not host a conference call, itsaid.

The Snapchat maker revamped its developer platform policies on March 17, 2022, to ban anonymous apps and require developers to build friend-finding apps to limit access to users 18 or older.

But others seemed to be working around Snap’s ban with their friend-finding apps marketed to users ages 12+, instead of the now required 18+. They got away with this by not actually using the SDK — something impossible to tell from their App Store marketing and screenshots which imply they’re directly integrated with Snap’s features. Another app had flown under the radar, continuing to operate in violation of the rules unless TechCrunch pointed it out, resulting in a belated ban. This lack of clarity on which apps are platform apps, and which are only pretending to be, could complicate things for Snap, which is engaged in litigation over bullying-related suicides. And like all social media, the company could be under new U.S. regulation related to child safety matters in the future, as well.<\/p>\n"embed breakout\">\n"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"Bd2UjCgxsR\">"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/05\/17\/snapchats-stricter-policies-for-anonymous-apps-and-friend-finders-arent-yet-fully-enforced\/\">Snapchat’s stricter policies for anonymous apps and friend finders aren’t yet fully enforced<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"“Snapchat’s stricter policies for anonymous apps and friend finders aren’t yet fully enforced” — TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/05\/17\/snapchats-stricter-policies-for-anonymous-apps-and-friend-finders-arent-yet-fully-enforced\/embed\/#?secret=e39VRJvFjG#?secret=Bd2UjCgxsR\" data-secret=\"Bd2UjCgxsR\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\nTwitter deal still a go… for now<\/h3>\nFirst,"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/05\/13\/elon-musk-twitter-deal-on-hold-spam\/\">Elon Musk tweeted<\/a> that the Twitter deal was “temporarily on hold” until Twitter could prove the percentage of spambots on its platform was actually less than 5%, as it reports.

Now, instead of asking users to agree to any subscription price increases, developers will be able to roll out a price increase with the user\u2019s explicit consent.

That\u2019s good news for startups looking for talent.<\/p>\n“I’ve always believed that people don’t join a company just for the economic benefits. They join for the opportunity to have an impact and to grow. And so in a lot of cases, it may be a more opportune time to take a chance in an early-stage company because you can focus on that long-term horizon, and you can get that opportunity to grow and have an impact,\u201d Hoffman told me.<\/p>\nFor employees, he said there will still be opportunities at good companies in any economic conditions, but attracting talent always comes down to creating a good place to work.<\/p>\n“Even in the tightest of economic environments \u2014 and we\u2019re not there yet \u2014 there\u2019s always going to be high demand for the best talent. Always. So the things that you need to do to attract, engage and retain these employees does not change,” he said.

likely to see the valuations of its still-private portfolio companies slide downward — possibly by a lot — depending on how long this correction lasts.<\/p>\nHershenson, who joined TechCrunch for a mobility-focused event this week, noted on stage that startups are in for a bumpy ride, given how frothy the market had grown.<\/p>"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\nAsked if the"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/for-tech-startups-the-party-is-over-11652710330?mod=tech_lead_pos5\">startup party is over<\/a>, Hershenson answered: “Maybe for a little while it’s over . . .The problem is that the market was priced too high in 2021, and we’re all adjusting to that price change, and that changes how companies raise money.<\/p>\n“Everybody knows that the stock market is down a lot,” she’d said. “Software stocks are down in some cases 80%. [Meanwhile] if you’re a private company, and you were very lucky and you raised money in 2021, you may have gotten a multiple of 100x on your ARR. Today, those multiples are 10x or 20x. That means that if your company was $2 billion [at the time of your fundraise], your company is [now] worth $200 million.:<\/p>\nEven with a steep reset in prices, however, Pear’s success to date is undeniable. It’s also unlikely.<\/p>\nNozad, very famously, was earlier a rug dealer who insisted on toting rugs to his clients’ homes, where during the course of long conversations, they would learn about the rug and he would learn about their business. He eventually became a scout for his boss, and a trusted friend to some very powerful people.<\/p>\n\u201cHe has a good sniffer, and I trust the guy,\u201d\u00a0 Sequoia\u2019s Doug Leone"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/victoriabarret\/2012\/03\/21\/silicon-valleys-hottest-vc-is-a-rug-dealer\/?sh=3dfe6dbb31d5\">told Forbes<\/a> back in 2012. \u201cHe\u2019s like me, from the earth.\u201d Sequoia has, in fact, backed a number of companies that Pear has funded, including Guardant Health and DoorDash.<\/p>\nMeanwhile, his partner, Mar Hershenson, was also very much an outlier when the two struck out on their own. Despite founding several companies previously — one of which Nozad backed — and though she holds an M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Stanford University, she is a native of Spain and even more unusual in VC circles a decade ago, she is a woman who had not previously cut her teeth at someone else’s venture firm.<\/p>\nThat may not seem very notable today but in 2012, it put Hershenson in rare company.<\/p>\nAs for the team’s newest bets, Pear hosted an invite-only demo day earlier this week, coverage of which we’ll have for readers soon. (Unlike Y Combinator, the outfit holds a demo day each year for a comparatively limited number of companies — typically around 10.)<\/p>\nIn the meantime, some of its other recent checks have gone to Sudozi, a two-year-old Austin, Tex., startup that provides a SaaS platform to help enterprises improve their money management capabilities and that just this month announced a"https:\/\/venturebeat.com\/2022\/05\/12\/sudozi-nabs-4-3m-to-simplify-money-management-for-enterprises\/\">$4.3 million<\/a> seed round led by Pear.<\/p>\nPear also recently wrote a follow-on check to Osmind, a two-year-old, Bay Area-based startup that makes software to chart and update patient information and documents, with a focus on mental health.

But it could also disincentivize advertisers from investing their budgets with the platform.<\/p>\nTwitter over the years has worked steadily to make the site a less abusive place, to varying degrees of success.<\/p>\nThe company has expanded its hate speech rules to include more nuance about what is and is not allowed on the app. In 2020, for example, it"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/03\/05\/twitter-bans-hate-speech-around-age-disability-and-in-the-wake-of-the-coronavirus-outbreak-disease\/\">added detail to its ban on dehumanizing speech<\/a> to include other areas like age, disability and even disease.

If anything, the pendulum will now swing in the other direction — away from strict moderation. And that could be bad for business.<\/p>\n"embed breakout\">\n"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"VB31XZllQw\">"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/04\/25\/twitter-accepts-elon-musks-43b-acquisition-offer\/\">Twitter accepts Elon Musk’s $44B acquisition offer<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"“Twitter accepts Elon Musk’s $44B acquisition offer” — TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/04\/25\/twitter-accepts-elon-musks-43b-acquisition-offer\/embed\/#?secret=CU0qUnaPL1#?secret=VB31XZllQw\" data-secret=\"VB31XZllQw\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\nAdvertisers are fairly allergic to having their brand’s name appear alongside hate speech and abusive or dangerous content on social platforms. They’ve proven this time and time again with boycotts for this specific reason.<\/p>\nIn 2017, for example, brands and publishers in Europe said they would pull their advertising dollars from Google’s YouTube after their ads were revealed as being displayed alongside videos promoting terrorism and antisemitism.

Notdecrease<\/em>.<\/p>\nHere’s Unilver’s statement from that time, to give you an idea: “Based on the current polarization and the election that we are having in the U.S., there needs to be much more enforcement in the area of hate speech.”<\/p>\nThe company was also boycotting Twitter at the time.<\/p>\nIn total, over 1,110 companies including major corporations and small businesses had joined that particular boycott. Other corporations including Coca-Cola, Starbucks, Clorox and Ford also temporarily paused their social ads but didn’t join the full-scale boycott.<\/p>\nNow imagine how these same brands will react if a “free speech” free-for-all really does take place on Twitter. The network, already, isn’t a top priority given its comparatively smaller size relative to others like Facebook, Instagram and TikTok. And if it was home to divisive and dangerous speech? It might just be time to go.<\/p>\nThis is not a minor concern for Twitter to weigh as it moves forward. The company has been experimenting with a number of new monetizable products — including Twitter Spaces and subscriptions — but its business today is almost entirely supported via advertising. During its fourth-quarter earnings, Twitter pulled in $1.57 billion in revenue — a miss on expectations of $1.58 billion because ad spending had slowed slightly in the quarter.
"https:\/\/www.emarketer.com\/content\/twitter-will-fly-past-2-billion-us-ad-revenues-this-year\">Per eMarketer,<\/a> advertising accounted for 89% of Twitter’s 2021 revenue and it forecast that would grow to above 91% by 2023.
