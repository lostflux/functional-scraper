AboutMachineScienceConstructionAssemblyNews & MediaTopGood progress in the cryoplantInstallation work in the cryoplant is nearing completion, and commissioning activities are scheduled to begin in July 2021. Follow all progress in the plant assembly pages of the ITER website (https://www.iter.org/construction/SystemsPlantAssembly). © Christian Luenig (www.arbeitsblende.de)25 March 2021Two important rolesThe cryogenic termination cold box has two roles: collecting and distributing cryogenic fluids produced in the cryoplant to the Tokamak Building, and warming up the fluids when it's time to bring clients back to room temperature for maintenance. Pictured: David Grillot, the head of ITER Cryogenic System Section.
12 November 2020The cryogenic termination cold boxProcured by ITER India and manufactured by the Swiss company Linde Kryotechnik AG, the cryogenic termination cold box is a massive structure packed with pipes, valves, electrical feedthroughs and pneumatic actuators.

Photo: ITER Organization/EJF Riche03 November 2020Cryoplant in OctoberThe ITER cryoplant comprises 5,400 m² of covered buildings plus a large exterior area for the storage of helium and nitrogen. An overhead bridge (not yet constructed) will connect the cryoplant to the Tokamak Complex. © Les Nouveaux Médias/SNC ENGAGE09 October 2020One of the last giantsOne of the last large components enters the ITER cryoplant: a 56-tonne helium dryer.
02 June 2020As dry as 'He' can getCold boxes do not like water. Before it is processed, gaseous helium needs to be perfectly dry to prevent damage. This crucial operation is the task of a 56-tonne ''helium dryer'' that was installed in the cryoplant on 27 May.
27 May 2020Inside the cold factoryAs large as two football pitches, the ITER cryoplant provides cooling fluids to 10,000 tonnes of superconducting magnets, eight massive cryopumps, and thousands of square metres of thermal shielding.
23 September 2019Compressor rowA total of 18 helium compressors and associated inlet filters and electrical motors are aligned on two parallel platforms inside the cryoplant.
23 September 2019Compression stationIn the liquid helium plant compression station, a narrow corridor separates the two parallel oil removal system skids. Oil is used in the helium compression process but needs to be removed entirely by a set of filters, separators, pumps etc.
23 September 2019The octopusEvocative of a monster bug or a creature from the depths, this multistage centrifugal compressor pressurizes nitrogen before liquefying it. Liquid nitrogen at 77 K (minus 196 °C) contributes to the cooling process of helium.
23 September 2019Three cold boxes plus oneServing the ITER cold clients requires three "cold boxes" plus a fourth to connect them (the "termination cold box," to the left). The 21-metre components —each weighing about 137 tonnes with internal systems—provide an insulated environment for heat exchangers, cryogenic adsorbers, liquid helium and liquid nitrogen phase separators.
23 September 2019A 4.5 MW electrical enginePacking the power of approximately 60 electric vehicles, this 4.5 MW motor feeds the multistage centrifugal nitrogen compressor.
23 September 2019Seven kilometres of pipesApproximately seven kilometres of pipes run through the installation, carrying helium, nitrogen and cooling water for the compressors and other equipment. Cooling water circulation in the cryoplant is in the range of 2,500 cubic metres per hour—the equivalent of an Olympic pool every 30 minutes.
23 September 2019Across the roadCryogens produced in the cryoplant (left) will travel by overhead bridge to the Tokamak Complex (concrete building at right).
10 May 2019Outside the cryoplantThis complex set of hand valves and local readings of pressure, temperature and flow is part of the cooling loop that maintains the temperature inside the cryoplant's quench tanks at 100 K.
01 March 2019Cryolines in productionINOXCVA in India is producing about half of the 5 km of cryolines needed for ITER (700 "spools") for the Indian Domestic Agency. Eighty percent have all kinds of angles, bends and turns.

17 July 2018TeamworkClose coordination is required of the different teams representing the ITER Organization, the European Domestic Agency, equipment manufacturer Air Liquide, mechanical installation contractors, and ITER's Construction Management-as-Agent.
17 July 2018Nitrogen as a pre-cooler for liquid heliumFor the nitrogen plant, the first phase of centrifugal compressor installation was achieved this month.
17 July 2018First industrial plant on siteThe ITER cryoplant used to be a vast echoey chamber with 5,400 m² of interior space divided into two areas; now, it is filled from floor to ceiling with industrial equipment.
17 July 2018Filling upMost of the planned components are now installed in the Compressor Building, drastically reducing the space for circulation.
17 July 2018The world's largest single-platform cryoplantThree parties are sharing responsibility for the plant's procurement: the ITER Organization, responsible for the liquid helium plants; Europe, in charge of the liquid nitrogen plant and auxiliary systems as well as the construction of the cryoplant infrastructure on site; and India, whose contractors are procuring the cryolines and cryodistribution components.

12 July 2017Concrete supportWork underway in the cryoplant to prepare for the arrival of 18 helium screw compressor skids. Each one of the 25-tonne units will be installed on top of its own four-metre-high concrete pad, allowing oil from the compressor to regain the oil separation system through gravity.
12 July 2017Row after rowThe 18 concrete structures in the ITER Compressor Building are massive pads that will each support one 25-tonne helium compressor skid. What appears as "windows" in the concrete blocks are in fact passages for the dense interconnecting piping.
12 July 2017Compressor Building, when it's chock fullIn the 3,400 m² available in the Compressor Building, contractors will install 18 oil-flooded screw compressors for the helium plant as well as other helium compressors and compressors for the liquid nitrogen plant.
01 July 2017Cold boxes take their placeOne of the three helium cold boxes is transported through the open door of the on-site cryoplant.
23 June 2017Celebrating a Council milestoneIn the presence of ITER Director-General Bernard Bigot and his two deputies, Chief Operating Officer Gyung-Su Lee and Relations Coordinating Officer Eisuke Tada, the team responsible for cold box installation celebrates the respect of an ITER Council milestone that scheduled the "Start of work in the cryoplant" for June 2017.
22 June 2017Temporary tank storageOn its way to the cryoplant, the second cold box on its transport trailer passes three tanks (two for gaseous helium and a third, at right, for liquid nitrogen). They too will be transported to the cryoplant for installation in the exterior storage area.
