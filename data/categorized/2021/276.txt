The Snapchat maker revamped its developer platform policies on March 17, 2022, to ban anonymous apps and require developers to build friend-finding apps to limit access to users 18 or older. The policy changes were effective immediately and existing developers were given 30 days to come into compliance \u2014 a date that would have passed last month.<\/p>\nIt is now mid-May and some developers of the newly banned and restricted apps are not yet meeting Snap\u2019s new requirements.<\/p>\nSnap confirmed to TechCrunch a small number of apps were given extensions, including anonymous apps LMK and Send It. But others seemed to be working around Snap’s ban with their friend-finding apps marketed to users ages 12+, instead of the now required 18+. They got away with this by not actually using the SDK — something impossible to tell from their App Store marketing and screenshots which imply they’re directly integrated with Snap’s features. Another app had flown under the radar, continuing to operate in violation of the rules unless TechCrunch pointed it out, resulting in a belated ban. This lack of clarity on which apps are platform apps, and which are only pretending to be, could complicate things for Snap, which is engaged in litigation over bullying-related suicides. And like all social media, the company could be under new U.S. regulation related to child safety matters in the future, as well.<\/p>\n"embed breakout\">\n"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"Bd2UjCgxsR\">"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/05\/17\/snapchats-stricter-policies-for-anonymous-apps-and-friend-finders-arent-yet-fully-enforced\/\">Snapchat’s stricter policies for anonymous apps and friend finders aren’t yet fully enforced<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"“Snapchat’s stricter policies for anonymous apps and friend finders aren’t yet fully enforced” — TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/05\/17\/snapchats-stricter-policies-for-anonymous-apps-and-friend-finders-arent-yet-fully-enforced\/embed\/#?secret=e39VRJvFjG#?secret=Bd2UjCgxsR\" data-secret=\"Bd2UjCgxsR\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\nTwitter deal still a go… for now<\/h3>\nFirst,"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/05\/13\/elon-musk-twitter-deal-on-hold-spam\/\">Elon Musk tweeted<\/a> that the Twitter deal was “temporarily on hold” until Twitter could prove the percentage of spambots on its platform was actually less than 5%, as it reports.

Now, instead of asking users to agree to any subscription price increases, developers will be able to roll out a price increase with the user\u2019s explicit consent. The feature allows developers to simply inform customers they\u2019ll be charged more, but not require the customer to opt-in to the higher pricing.<\/p>\n"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/04\/05\/apple-pilot-tests-feature-that-allows-developers-to-automatically-charge-users-for-subscription-price-increases\/\">We first broke the news that Apple was pilot testing this program<\/a> last month, when it appeared Disney+ subscription customers had simply been told their price was increasing but weren\u2019t asked for their consent. Apple then confirmed this was the result of a \u201cnew commerce feature\u201d it planned to launch soon, which it said would be \u201cgreat for both developers and users.\u201d<\/p>\nApple\u2019s position is that this could save customers the hassle of having their subscriptions automatically canceled just because they didn\u2019t see the notification or email that asked them to opt in to the price increase.<\/p>\n\u201cThis has led to some services being unintentionally interrupted for users and they must take steps to resubscribe within the app, from Settings on iPhone and iPad, or in the App Store on Mac,\u201d the company explained in its announcement on Monday.<\/p>\nHowever, the flip side of this argument is that those same customers who would have missed the consent notification will likely be the same ones who would now miss the notification informing them their subscription will be increasing in price. There\u2019s also an argument here that this change could enable unscrupulous developers and scammers to better profit from their victims if Apple doesn’t carefully enforce the program rules.<\/p>\nCurrently, those state that developers can\u2019t increase prices more than once per year. The increase also can\u2019t exceed 50% of the subscription price, and the difference in price can\u2019t exceed $5 USD per period for non-annual subscriptions or $50 USD for annual subscriptions.<\/p>\nWeekly News<\/h1>\nPlatforms: Apple<\/h3>\n\nApple"https:\/\/9to5mac.com\/2022\/05\/19\/ios-15-6-beta-1-available-public-beta-testers\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">released<\/a> the first public betas of iOS 15.6,<\/strong>\u00a0iPadOS 15.6, tvOS 15.6,"https:\/\/www.imore.com\/how-download-watchos-8-public-beta\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">watchOS 8.7<\/a> and macOS 12.5.

This allows brands to tap into the power of the creator\u2019s platform and reach their fanbase, but then gives the brands themselves access to that audience \u2014 and the key metrics and analytics associated with their live event \u2014 directly on their own YouTube channel.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nFintech<\/h3>\n\nFTX US"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/05\/19\/crypto-exchange-ftx-expands-into-stock-trading-retail-investors\/\">plans to launch<\/a> FTX Stocks, a zero-commission stock trading feature available through the FTX mobile app,<\/strong> rolling out in the U.S. in the “coming months.” The news is particularly notable given that billionaire FTX US founder Sam Bankman-Fried recently acquired a 7.6% stake in Robinhood.<\/li>\nRobinhood will launch a standalone app that"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2022\/05\/17\/robinhood-to-let-users-hold-their-own-crypto-and-nfts-as-start-up-reaches-for-growth-beyond-stock-trading.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">lets users hold their own cryptocurrencies and NFTs<\/a>,<\/strong> putting it in direct competition with Coinbase and startups like MetaMask or Rainbow.

They join for the opportunity to have an impact and to grow.

Always. So the things that you need to do to attract, engage and retain these employees does not change,” he said.

for comment, cofounder Pejman Nozad emailed back, “I can’t comment!”<\/p>\nNozad and cofounder Mar Hershenson have long been first-stop for prominent early-stage investors that are looking to fund nascent teams, given the firm has been among the earliest backers in a notable number of companies that have gone to raise ever-bigger rounds and higher valuations, including the now publicly traded companies DoorDash and Guardant Health.<\/p>\nOther startups to attract capital from Pear before nearly any other firm was aware of their existence include the deep-linking startup Branch, which

likely to see the valuations of its still-private portfolio companies slide downward — possibly by a lot — depending on how long this correction lasts.<\/p>\nHershenson, who joined TechCrunch for a mobility-focused event this week, noted on stage that startups are in for a bumpy ride, given how frothy the market had grown.<\/p>"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\nAsked if the"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/for-tech-startups-the-party-is-over-11652710330?mod=tech_lead_pos5\">startup party is over<\/a>, Hershenson answered: “Maybe for a little while it’s over . . .The problem is that the market was priced too high in 2021, and we’re all adjusting to that price change, and that changes how companies raise money.<\/p>\n“Everybody knows that the stock market is down a lot,” she’d said. “Software stocks are down in some cases 80%. [Meanwhile] if you’re a private company, and you were very lucky and you raised money in 2021, you may have gotten a multiple of 100x on your ARR. Today, those multiples are 10x or 20x. That means that if your company was $2 billion [at the time of your fundraise], your company is [now] worth $200 million.:<\/p>\nEven with a steep reset in prices, however, Pear’s success to date is undeniable. It’s also unlikely.<\/p>\nNozad, very famously, was earlier a rug dealer who insisted on toting rugs to his clients’ homes, where during the course of long conversations, they would learn about the rug and he would learn about their business. He eventually became a scout for his boss, and a trusted friend to some very powerful people.<\/p>\n\u201cHe has a good sniffer, and I trust the guy,\u201d\u00a0 Sequoia\u2019s Doug Leone"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/victoriabarret\/2012\/03\/21\/silicon-valleys-hottest-vc-is-a-rug-dealer\/?sh=3dfe6dbb31d5\">told Forbes<\/a> back in 2012. \u201cHe\u2019s like me, from the earth.\u201d Sequoia has, in fact, backed a number of companies that Pear has funded, including Guardant Health and DoorDash.<\/p>\nMeanwhile, his partner, Mar Hershenson, was also very much an outlier when the two struck out on their own. Despite founding several companies previously — one of which Nozad backed — and though she holds an M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Stanford University, she is a native of Spain and even more unusual in VC circles a decade ago, she is a woman who had not previously cut her teeth at someone else’s venture firm.<\/p>\nThat may not seem very notable today but in 2012, it put Hershenson in rare company.<\/p>\nAs for the team’s newest bets, Pear hosted an invite-only demo day earlier this week, coverage of which we’ll have for readers soon. (Unlike Y Combinator, the outfit holds a demo day each year for a comparatively limited number of companies — typically around 10.)<\/p>\nIn the meantime, some of its other recent checks have gone to Sudozi, a two-year-old Austin, Tex., startup that provides a SaaS platform to help enterprises improve their money management capabilities and that just this month announced a"https:\/\/venturebeat.com\/2022\/05\/12\/sudozi-nabs-4-3m-to-simplify-money-management-for-enterprises\/\">$4.3 million<\/a> seed round led by Pear.<\/p>\nPear also recently wrote a follow-on check to Osmind, a two-year-old, Bay Area-based startup that makes software to chart and update patient information and documents, with a focus on mental health.

Over the past month, public and private tech companies have been announcing mass layoffs across sectors. Employees from Section4, Carvana, DataRobot, Mural, Robinhood, On Deck, Thrasio, MainStreet and Netflix have been impacted by the workforce reductions. Some bigger companies are instituting hiring freezes, such as Twitter and Meta, or announcing a shift in strategy, such as Uber.<\/p>\nAs has been our mantra while reporting on the layoffs sweeping the tech industry:"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/05\/11\/tech-layoffs-dont-happen-to-companies-they-happen-to-people\/\"> layoffs don\u2019t happen to companies, they happen to people<\/a>. Especially for the U.S.-based tech employees, layoffs don\u2019t just mean a loss of income — they mean a medically dangerous loss of healthcare.<\/p>\nLet\u2019s take a look at which companies announced reductions this week.<\/p>\n"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/05\/17\/netflix-lays-off-150-staffers-citing-slowing-revenue-growth\/\">Netflix layoffs continue\u00a0<\/strong><\/a><\/h2>\nAfter layoffs hit Netflix\u2019s content arm"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/04\/28\/netflix-layoffs-tudum-editorial\/\">Tudum<\/a> a few weeks ago, 150 more primarily U.S.-based employees"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/05\/17\/netflix-lays-off-150-staffers-citing-slowing-revenue-growth\/\">were let go<\/a>, plus 70 other employees in the animation division.<\/p>\nA Netflix representative wrote in an emailed statement, \u201cAs we explained on earnings, our slowing revenue growth means we are also having to slow our cost growth as a company.\u201d Netflix reported revenue of $7.87 billion for the first quarter of 2022 and a significant loss of 200,000 subscribers.<\/p>\nContractors were also impacted by these layoffs, but the number of affected workers in that designation is unclear. TechCrunch asked Netflix about reports that staff running diverse social channels like Strong Black Lead, Golden, Most and Con Todo were laid off, but Netflix said that the company decided not to renew contracts with certain agencies it used to recruit contractors. Still, it doesn\u2019t feel great to see queer people and people of color losing their jobs, which helped Netflix cater to these audiences.<\/p>"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\nPicsart’s unicorn status didn’t save it\u00a0<\/strong><\/h2>\nLess than a year ago, Picsart raised $130 million from SoftBank, putting the visual creator tools startup into unicorn territory with a valuation exceeding $1 billion.

Other SoftBank-backed companies like"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/05\/04\/cameo-layoff-unicorn\/\">Cameo<\/a>, which also became a unicorn last year, just conducted layoffs. When Alex Wilhelm last covered Picsart,"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/08\/26\/picsart-raises-130m-from-softbank-becomes-unicorn-on-the-back-of-its-visual-creator-tools\/\">he noted<\/a> that the company was expected to go public — that still hasn\u2019t happened, which may be a clue into what\u2019s going on at the company to precipitate such cuts.<\/p>\n"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/05\/19\/cars24-cuts-600-jobs\/\">India\u2019s Cars24 cuts 600 jobs<\/a><\/h2>\nCars24, a marketplace for used cars last valued at $3.3 billion by its venture capital investors, cut 600 jobs — or 6% of its entire workforce — this week. The Series G startup had just raised a $400 million round, making the reduction more about runway extension than lack of ability to pay the bills.<\/p>\nAs our own Manish Singh reports, Cars24 is one of many Indian startups that fired people in the last few weeks. Employees from Vedantu, Unacademy, Meesho, OkCredit, Trell, Furlenco and Lido have also cut several roles, he says.<\/p>\nMarketplace startups, such as Cars24, feel especially vulnerable during a downturn. Consumer spending habits can get extremely fickle, which means that demand may decline while supply stays consistent or even grows. Balancing the two sides is the biggest art for any marketplace startup, but it becomes especially difficult to predict stability in revenue when everyone else has hit pause.<\/p>\nSkillz scales back esports biz team\u00a0<\/strong><\/h2>\nEsports company Skillz laid off 70 employees, around 10% of the team, earlier this week, the company confirmed to TechCrunch. No executives were impacted by the cuts.<\/p>\n\u201cWe decided to reorganize our resources and investments to increase our profitable growth and further deliver against our vision of building the competition layer of the internet,\u201d the company said in an emailed statement. \u201cThis realignment resulted in changing some of our programs and consequently people on our team as we prioritize our resourcing levels to continue to offer a great player experience and enable more game developers to bring their creations to life.\u201d<\/p>\nThe company\u2019s statement is ironic; to better support its external community, it is cutting its internal community.

rolling out a"https:\/\/blog.twitter.com\/en_us\/topics\/company\/2022\/introducing-our-crisis-misinformation-policy\">crisis misinformation policy<\/a> to ensure that it doesn’t amplify falsehoods during times of widespread strife.<\/p>\nTo determine whether a tweet is misleading, Twitter will require verification from credible, public sources, including conflict monitoring groups, humanitarian organizations, open source investigators, journalists and more. If the platform finds that the tweet is misleading, it’ll slap a warning notice on the tweet, turn off likes, retweets and shares, and link to more details about the policy. These tweets will also stop surfacing on the home page, search or explore.<\/p>\nNotably, Twitter will “preserve this content for accountability purposes,” so it will remain online. Users will just have to click through the warning to view the tweet. In the past, some warnings about"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/08\/17\/twitter-report-misinformation\/\"> election or COVID-19 misinformation<\/a> have simply been notices that appear in line beneath the tweet, rather than covering it up entirely.<\/p>\n"attachment_2321853\" style=\"width: 3654px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">"caption-attachment-2321853\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2321853 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/crisismisinfo.png.img_.fullhd.medium.png\" alt=\"Twitter crisis misinfo policy notice\" width=\"3644\" height=\"2576\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/crisismisinfo.png.img_.fullhd.medium.png 3644w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/crisismisinfo.png.img_.fullhd.medium.png?resize=150,106 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/crisismisinfo.png.img_.fullhd.medium.png?resize=300,212 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/crisismisinfo.png.img_.fullhd.medium.png?resize=768,543 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/crisismisinfo.png.img_.fullhd.medium.png?resize=680,481 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/crisismisinfo.png.img_.fullhd.medium.png?resize=1536,1086 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/crisismisinfo.png.img_.fullhd.medium.png?resize=2048,1448 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/crisismisinfo.png.img_.fullhd.medium.png?resize=50,35 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 3644px) 100vw, 3644px\" \/>"caption-attachment-2321853\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image Credits:<\/strong> Twitter<\/p><\/div><\/p>\nTwitter says it will prioritize adding warning notices to viral tweets or posts from high-profile accounts, which may include verified users, state-affiliated media and government accounts. This strategy makes a lot of sense, since a tweet from a prominent figure is more likely to go viral than a tweet from an ordinary person with 50 followers — but it’s a wonder that more platforms haven’t taken this approach already.<\/p>\nSome examples of tweets that might be flagged under this policy include false on-the-ground event reporting, misleading allegations of war crimes, atrocities, or use of weapons and misinformation about international community response, sanctions, defensive operations and more. Personal anecdotes don’t fall under the policy, nor do people’s strong opinions, commentary or satire. Tweets that call attention to a false claim in order to refute it are allowed, too.<\/p>\nTwitter began working on a crisis misinformation framework last year alongside human rights organizations, it says.

What is this collective that tries to save crypto through AriZona Iced Tea?<\/strong><\/p>\nBM: We\u2019re a little group called Mossy, and the last three things we\u2019ve made have all been web3 projects. We created"https:\/\/nfog.xyz\/\">non-fungible Olive Gardens<\/a>, and then we did"https:\/\/theblockedchain.xyz\/\">Blockedchain<\/a>, which was an NFT series that you can only mint if you\u2019re blocked by specific people on Twitter, like Marc Andreesen. And now the latest is USDTea, which is a stablecoin that\u2019s linked to the most stable asset we know on planet Earth, which is AriZona Iced Tea.<\/p>\nCan you literally connect your wallet to this and get a token?\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\nWell, first of all, I just got word that we are fully out of the 1,000 that we started with [after about an hour and a half post-launch]. That\u2019s the weirdness of this world. It was the same thing with non-fungible Olive Gardens; we quietly released it, and then it was gone within I think 10 hours.<\/p>\nAriZona Iced Tea might be $0.99, but what about gas fees?<\/strong><\/p>\nThe way the flow works is the fees aren\u2019t super high. It\u2019s an ERC 20 token. I bought some and I think it was, you know, negligible, like $4 or something in gas fees. And then, just like any other stablecoins that are pegged to currency, you can always switch back. In this case, you can burn your USDTea and we will ship you cans of AriZona Iced Tea, because it wouldn\u2019t be backed by it if we didn\u2019t actually do that. So we have our strategic reserves of AriZona Iced Tea to use if people want to convert it back at any given time.<\/p>\nDo you actually have 1,000 cans of tea?\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\nIt\u2019s 1,000 cans where we\u2019re starting. That might expand in the future. And if we do that, I think we\u2019d probably be open to external auditing depending on the situation, but currently, we\u2019ve got 1,000 cans basically, and we will distribute them as necessary. Right now we do have reserves split around different locations around the U.S.<\/p>\nDo you make these satirical web3 projects as your full-time job?<\/strong><\/p>\nThe more we do this, the more it becomes something that is more full time, but I\u2019d say we\u2019re mostly artists.<\/p>\nHow many people are you?<\/strong><\/p>\nWe\u2019re three people. So we\u2019re pretty \u2026 I guess the word would be nimble. It allows us to make things very quickly. In the case of the destabilization of currency-pegged cryptocurrencies, you know, when did that whole snafu go down? We\u2019re trying to bolster the crypto economy as quickly as possible, and we can only do that with a small team.<\/p>\n"attachment_2321307\" style=\"width: 1840px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">"caption-attachment-2321307\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2321307 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Screen-Shot-2022-05-18-at-5.08.03-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1830\" height=\"1686\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Screen-Shot-2022-05-18-at-5.08.03-PM.png 1830w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Screen-Shot-2022-05-18-at-5.08.03-PM.png?resize=150,138 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Screen-Shot-2022-05-18-at-5.08.03-PM.png?resize=300,276 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Screen-Shot-2022-05-18-at-5.08.03-PM.png?resize=768,708 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Screen-Shot-2022-05-18-at-5.08.03-PM.png?resize=680,626 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Screen-Shot-2022-05-18-at-5.08.03-PM.png?resize=1536,1415 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Screen-Shot-2022-05-18-at-5.08.03-PM.png?resize=50,46 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1830px) 100vw, 1830px\" \/>"caption-attachment-2321307\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image Credits:<\/strong>"https:\/\/usdtea.io\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">USDTea"screen-reader-text\">(opens in a new window)<\/span><\/a><\/p><\/div><\/p>\nDid you conceive of this idea last week when Terra was collapsing?<\/strong><\/p>\nExactly.

lunch<\/a> to everyone in New York City yesterday. What could go wrong?<\/p>\nBetween 11 a.m. and 2 p.m., New Yorkers could use a Grubhub promo code to get a $15 discount on lunch. Naturally, restaurants got flooded with an unexpected deluge of orders. According to"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/kelseyweekman\/grubhub-free-lunch-nyc-promo-chaos\">Buzzfeed<\/a>, a worker at a Mexican restaurant in Harlem hand-delivered orders herself via Uber, since their in-house delivery driver was too overloaded. An employee at Greenberg’s Bagels in Brooklyn also told Buzzfeed that they received 50 orders in an hour, whereas they typically receive about 10 orders from Grubhub per day.<\/p>\nAcross New York City, Grubhub said that it received about"https:\/\/www.axios.com\/2022\/05\/17\/grubhub-free-lunch-promo-new-york\">6,000 orders<\/a> per minute. Within an hour, some users tweeted that the promo code was no longer working, or that restaurants had marked themselves closed to avoid receiving any more orders. All in all, many orders got delayed and\/or cancelled, but restaurant workers and delivery drivers were most adversely impacted, struggling to fulfill orders at an impossible rate.<\/p>\nGrubhub said that it modeled this promotion after a previous one, but this time, customers used the promo code six times more, causing unexpectedly high demand.<\/p>\n“To help businesses prepare for yesterday\u2019s promotion, we gave advance notice to all restaurants in our network, which included multiple forms of communications across email and in-platform,” Grubhub said in a statement to TechCrunch. “Even with that preparation, no one could anticipate the level of demand and unfortunately that caused strain on some restaurants. We\u2019ll undoubtedly have a lot of learnings from this that can help us optimize and mitigate issues in the future.”<\/p>\nEvidently, many restaurant workers didn’t get the memo — and even so, taking proactive measures like adding an extra driver to a shift wouldn’t have prepared a restaurant to meet such a dramatic surge in demand.<\/p>\n"embed breakout\">\n"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n"en\" dir=\"ltr\">New Yorkers went as hard for free lunch as the Rangers did in game 7.<\/p>"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\nOur restaurants and drivers are still working hard fulfilling your orders.

The company says it fulfilled"https:\/\/www.axios.com\/2022\/05\/17\/grubhub-free-lunch-promo-new-york\">400,000 lunch orders<\/a>, which at $15 a pop, would put the company out $6,000,000 for what was largely a screw up.<\/p>\nGrubhub has also faced scrutiny and legal troubles for false advertising,"https:\/\/www.foodandwine.com\/news\/grubhub-class-action-lawsuit-adding-restaurants-without-permission\">listing restaurants on their app<\/a> without the business’ consent.

in"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/05\/16\/buffalo-mass-shooting-social-media\/\">a racist attack<\/a> on a Buffalo, New York supermarket. The eighteen-year-old white supremacist shooter livestreamed his attack on Twitch, the Amazon-owned video game streaming platform. Even though Twitch removed the video two minutes after the violence began, it was still too late — now, gruesome footage of the terrorist attack is openly circulating on platforms like Facebook and Twitter, even after the companies have vowed to take down the video.<\/p>\nOn Facebook, some users who flagged the video were notified that"https:\/\/twitter.com\/EoinHiggins_\/status\/1525860078166937601\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the content did not violate its rules<\/a>. The company told TechCrunch that this was a mistake, adding that it has teams working around the clock to take down videos of the shooting, as well as links to the video hosted on other sites. Facebook said that it is also removing copies of the shooter’s racist screed and content that praises him.<\/p>\nBut when we searched a term as simple as “footage of buffalo shooting” on Facebook, one of the first results featured a 54-second screen recording of the terrorist’s footage. TechCrunch encountered the video an hour after it had been uploaded and reported it immediately. The video wasn’t taken down until three hours after posting, when it had already been viewed over a thousand times.<\/p>\nIn theory, this shouldn’t happen. A representative for Facebook told TechCrunch that it added multiple versions of the video, as well as the shooter’s racist writings, to a database of violating content, which helps the platform identify, remove and block such content. We asked Facebook about this particular incident, but they did not provide additional details.<\/p>\n"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">“We’re going to continue to learn, to refine our processes, to ensure that we can detect and take down violating content more quickly in the future,” Facebook integrity VP Guy Rosen said in response to a question about why the company struggled to remove copies of the video in an unrelated call on Tuesday.<\/span><\/p>\nReposts of the shooter’s stream were also easy to find on Twitter. In fact, when we typed “buffalo video” into the search bar, Twitter suggested searches like “buffalo video full video graphic,” “buffalo video leaked” and “buffalo video graphic.”<\/p>\n"attachment_2320128\" style=\"width: 479px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">"caption-attachment-2320128\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2320128\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Screen-Shot-2022-05-17-at-8.58.45-AM.png?w=469\" alt=\"\" width=\"469\" height=\"288\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Screen-Shot-2022-05-17-at-8.58.45-AM.png 469w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Screen-Shot-2022-05-17-at-8.58.45-AM.png?resize=150,92 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Screen-Shot-2022-05-17-at-8.58.45-AM.png?resize=300,184 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Screen-Shot-2022-05-17-at-8.58.45-AM.png?resize=50,31 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 469px) 100vw, 469px\" \/>"caption-attachment-2320128\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image Credits:<\/strong> Twitter, screenshot by TechCrunch<\/p><\/div><\/p>"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\nWe encountered multiple videos of the attack that have been circulating on Twitter for over two days. One such video had over 261,000 views when we reviewed it on Tuesday afternoon.<\/p>\nIn April, Twitter"https:\/\/help.twitter.com\/en\/rules-and-policies\/perpetrators-of-violent-attacks\">enacted a policy<\/a> that bans individual perpetrators of violent attacks from Twitter. Under this policy, the platform also reserves the right to take down multimedia related to attacks, as well as language from terrorist “manifestos.”<\/p>\n“We are removing videos and media related to the incident. In addition, we may remove Tweets disseminating the manifesto or other content produced by perpetrators,” a spokesperson from Twitter told TechCrunch. The company called this “hateful and discriminatory” content “harmful for society.”<\/p>\nTwitter also claims that some users are attempting to circumvent takedowns by uploading altered or manipulated content related to the attack.<\/p>\n"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">In contrast, video footage of the weekend’s tragedy was relatively difficult to find on YouTube. Basic search terms for the Buffalo shooting video mostly brought up coverage from mainstream news outlets. With the same search terms we used on Twitter and Facebook, we were able to identify a handful of YouTube videos with thumbnails of the shooting that were actually unrelated content once clicked through. On TikTok, TechCrunch identified some posts that directed users to websites where they could watch the video but didn’t find the actual footage on the app in our searches.<\/span><\/p>\nTwitch, Twitter and Facebook have stated that they are working with the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism to limit the spread of the video. Twitch and Discord have also confirmed that they are working with government authorities that are investigating the situation. The shooter described his plans for the shooting in detail in a private Discord server prior to the attack.<\/p>\nAccording to documents reviewed by TechCrunch, the Buffalo shooter decided to broadcast his attack on Twitch because a 2019 anti-semitic shooting at Halle Synagogue remained live on Twitch for"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2019\/10\/09\/the-german-synagogue-shooting-was-streamed-on-twitch.html\">over 30 minutes<\/a> before it was taken down. The shooter considered streaming to Facebook but opted not to use the platform because he thought users needed to be logged in to watch livestreams.<\/p>\nFacebook has also inadvertently hosted mass shootings that evaded algorithmic detection.

My editor is probably wondering the same thing. But here are the tech angle(s):<\/p>\n\n“All Star” is to internet culture as “Jane Eyre” is to gothic literature. It’s a classic. Especially with the rise of TikTok, songs\u00a0are<\/em> memes now — be honest with yourself, did you know who Capone was before the “oh no no no” song went viral? How many Gen Z-ers listened to Fleetwood Mac for the first time because of the Ocean Spray longboarding guy? Smash Mouth would have faded from relevance much earlier if “All Star” didn’t appear in the opening sequence of “Shrek,” a film that has become inextricable from its second life on the internet.<\/li>\nLet’s not forget Owl City, the solo project ofelectronic<\/em> (tech angle!) musician Adam Young. The dude knows he’s a one-hit wonder, and he’s in on the joke. He wrote the lyric, “You would not believe your eyes\/if ten million fireflies\/lit up the world as I fell asleep,” then goes on to claim that he got “a thousand hugs from ten thousand lightning bugs.” Listen. I might be a writer who is shitposting about Smash Mouth on a Friday to distract herself from other things (uhh,"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/05\/13\/elon-musk-twitter-deal-on-hold-spam\/\">Elon Musk<\/a>), but Iam<\/em> a writer, and I’ll tell you, that lyric makes no fucking sense. But Owl City did what any butt of a joke on the internet had to do: he committed to the bit, cementing himself as anall star<\/em>. When a fan asked him what he meant by that lyric — “does each firefly hug you 1,000 times, or do only 1\/10th of the bugs give you a hug?” — Young wrote a"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/owlcity\/posts\/10155050947042025:0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">long Facebook post<\/a> (yes, Facebook, atech<\/em> company — tech angle!) confirming that he “was embraced 1,000 times by 10,000 luminescent insects.” Great stuff here.<\/li>\nJohn and Hank Green helped shape the creator economy as we know it — their business DFTBA Records fulfills merchandise purchases for a number of independent internet personalities, and they co-founded VidCon, an annual convention about online video. Not to mention that they helm one of the longest-running, large internet communities via their YouTube channel, vlogbrothers. Online video? Big deal.

representatives"https:\/\/oversight.house.gov\/news\/press-releases\/oversight-and-foreign-affairs-committees-call-on-social-media-companies-to\">signed letters<\/a> to the CEOs of Meta, TikTok, YouTube and Twitter urging them to archive any content uploaded to their platforms that could be used as evidence of Russian war crimes.<\/p>\nAs TikTok booms in popularity and"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/09\/27\/tiktok-reached-1-billion-monthly-active-users\/\">surpasses 1 billion users<\/a>, the rise of short-form video has offered unprecedented access to live footage from war zones — not to mention that Meta, YouTube and Twitter continue to capture our attention, too. These members of congress — Representatives Carolyn Maloney (D-NY), Gregory Meeks (D-NY), Stephen Lynch (D-MA) and William Keating (D-MA) — think that social media uploads can be instrumental in holding the perpetrators of human rights violations accountable.<\/p>\nGraphic wartime videos are often removed from social platforms, since they can violate terms of service that prohibit violent content. But according to a Human Rights Watch (HRW)"https:\/\/www.hrw.org\/report\/2020\/09\/10\/video-unavailable\/social-media-platforms-remove-evidence-war-crimes\">report<\/a>, which is cited in these letters to CEOs, it’s not clear what happens to these videos once they’re removed from the public-facing apps. Facebook, for example, says it keeps deleted data for at least 90 days, but Facebook told the HRW that it sometimes retains data for longer when requested by law enforcement.<\/p>\n“We are concerned that social media platforms [ \u2026 ] do not have adequate procedures in place to archive this content so that it can be made available to international organizations conducting investigations into allegations of war crimes and other atrocities,” the representatives’"https:\/\/oversight.house.gov\/news\/press-releases\/oversight-and-foreign-affairs-committees-call-on-social-media-companies-to\">statement<\/a> reads.<\/p>\nIn particular, the four representatives are calling on these platforms to preserve and archive potentially useful content for an extended period of time; coordinate with international human rights organizations to develop a legal, established way to share such content; increase transparency around AI-based content moderation systems and how they interface with war content; and, creating a way for users to flag content that they think might contain evidence of war crimes.<\/p>\n“Photos, videos and other content posted on social media have increasingly supported accountability processes, including judicial proceedings, for serious international crimes, both at the national and international level,” the HRW report"https:\/\/www.hrw.org\/report\/2020\/09\/10\/video-unavailable\/social-media-platforms-remove-evidence-war-crimes\">explains<\/a>. The HRW states that there have been at least 10 cases in Germany, Finland, the Netherlands and Sweden where people involved in war crimes in Iraq and Syria have been persecuted using evidence from social media posts.<\/p>\nThough this evidence can aid international legal systems, these bodies will also have to be careful not to fall prey to misinformation, which may be used to facilitate a wrongful conviction. Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February, there have been many instances of fake videos going viral on social media, like"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2022\/03\/05\/technology\/tiktok-ukraine-misinformation.html\">video game footage<\/a> that’s presented as though it were filmed on the ground in Ukraine.<\/p>"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\nTechCrunch has reached out to Meta, TikTok, YouTube and Twitter for comment.

Online, Nguyen is known as"https:\/\/jasminericegirl.com\/\">jasminericegirl<\/a>, whether she’s streaming games like Valorant on Twitch or posting raunchy jokes to her 157,000 Twitter followers.<\/p>\n\u201cI am a creator at heart and I always will be, and just because I\u2019m also a founder now doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not a creator,\u201d Nguyen said. She sees these two sides of her persona as complementary, rather than at odds with one another, or — god forbid — unprofessional. \u201cIt\u2019s a positive thing that really goes hand in hand, and I think a good investor will see that.\u201d<\/p>\nAs it turns out, Nguyen was right. Fanhouse just secured a $20 million Series A round from Andreessen Horowitz, and the platform is about to surpass $10 million in creator payouts in less than two years. Its creators include The Chainsmokers (who are also"https:\/\/musically.com\/2021\/05\/28\/chainsmokers-vc-firm-invests-in-fan-funding-startup-fanhouse\/\">pre-seed investors<\/a>),"https:\/\/fanhouse.app\/andreabotez\/fanwall\">Andrea Botez<\/a>,"https:\/\/fanhouse.app\/yoshi_sudarso\/fanwall\">Yoshi Sudarso<\/a> and more.<\/p>\nIt\u2019s not unheard of for a YouTube star or TikTok sensation to be the face of a creator economy startup, but usually when this happens, it\u2019s with extremely established, high-earning names looking for new business opportunities, like MrBeast with"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/04\/20\/creative-juice-investment-creators-youtube\/\">Creative Juice<\/a>, or David Dobrik with"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/21\/spark-capital-decides-to-sever-all-ties-with-david-dobriks-dispo-app-weeks-after-leading-investment\/\">Dispo<\/a>.

Growing up in a low-income household, her goal was simply to make enough money to pull her family out of poverty. When she graduated from the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School, she took a job in investment banking for the salary alone. But soon, she found herself staying up late into the night to work on the idea for Fanhouse.<\/p>\n\u201cI realized I do have a dream job, and this is it,\u201d she said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say my passion is entrepreneurship, but my passion is helping content creators.\u201d<\/p>\nUnlike OnlyFans, Fanhouse doesn\u2019t allow NSFW content \u2014 too many hoops to jump through with credit card companies and fundraising. Nguyen isn’t opposed to the idea, but she thinks that there needs to be “a more societal and legal shift” before that could feasibly work for Fanhouse. OnlyFans faced its own debacle last year when it"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/08\/25\/onlyfans-suspends-decision-to-ban-explicit-content\/\">nearly banned<\/a> NSFW content due to changing guidelines of credit card companies.<\/p>\nFans can pay a monthly fee to access exclusive content, which includes text, photo, video and audio uploads. Fanhouse also just implemented an integration with Spotify, so for example, if you’re one of the top listeners of The Chainsmokers, you can subscribe to them on Fanhouse for free.<\/p>\nBut what sets the platform apart is its commitment to protecting creators. This is, of course, related to Nguyen\u2019s own experiences in the public eye.<\/p>\n\u201cOn Twitter, I\u2019ll receive unsolicited dick pics, report them and never get a reply from Twitter,\u201d Nguyen said. She also recalls receiving threats from subscribers on OnlyFans. \u201cAll these problems that I experience on platforms, I set out to change.\u201d<\/p>\nAs Nguyen"https:\/\/twitter.com\/fanhouse\/status\/1521186154946523136\">tweeted<\/a> from the Fanhouse account last week: \u201cjust a reminder that when someone leaks private content from fanhouse, not only will our support team trace down who leaked it to fine and deactivate them, but they’ll also DMCA the site. we’ve taken down entire subreddits and discord servers before. do not mess with our creators.\u201d<\/p>\nNguyen says that Fanhouse is able to take down leaks and find out who leaked exclusive content because every creator upload is watermarked. Each fan has their own personal watermark, so if they are leaking content, Fanhouse can trace the leak back to their account.<\/p>\nEvery account on Fanhouse also has to be connected to a phone number, and if a user gets banned once, then they can\u2019t make another account with that phone number again.<\/p>\nWhen it comes to payments, Fanhouse takes 10% of creator earnings, which is small compared to OnlyFans\u2019 20% or Twitch’s 50-50 split. But despite being a new app with about 25 team members, Fanhouse has already stood up to Apple over its 30% cut of in-app purchases.<\/p>\n"embed breakout\">\n"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Fanhouse is a start-up I founded to empower creators, and we pay our creators 90% of transactions.

If a fan wants to buy coins in the app, they’ll be charged an extra 50% to account for Apple’s cut, incentivizing them to just make the purchase on the web. Other platforms like Twitch try to do this by selling in-app currency like “bits,” which can be purchased online and doled out on the app.<\/p>\n“It’s not the easiest way to get creators paid; now there’s just an extra step, but we’d rather take that extra step, because the other alternative is that creator’s earnings are directly taken away from them,” she said.<\/p>\nFounding a startup is always a risk, and for Nguyen, the risk is personal — she still wants to fulfill her goal of supporting her family, and that surely would have been easier if she stayed in investment banking. But so far, her decision feels like it was worth it.<\/p>\n“[Growing up], we were always scraping by,” she remembers. “But I’d rather be doing Fanhouse and live like that than do banking and be more stable.”<\/p>\n"embed breakout\">\n"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"uKeRIkn80i\">"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/12\/30\/not-every-creator-economy-startup-is-built-for-creators\/\">Not every creator economy startup is built for creators<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"“Not every creator economy startup is built for creators” — TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/12\/30\/not-every-creator-economy-startup-is-built-for-creators\/embed\/#?secret=j9wxTcxd4j#?secret=uKeRIkn80i\" data-secret=\"uKeRIkn80i\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n"embed breakout\">\n"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"Km5bqJJCPH\">"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/04\/20\/linktree-creator-economy-report-research\/\">Only 12% of full-time creators make over $50K a year, says Linktree<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"“Only 12% of full-time creators make over $50K a year, says Linktree” — TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/04\/20\/linktree-creator-economy-report-research\/embed\/#?secret=AdrLziqRgz#?secret=Km5bqJJCPH\" data-secret=\"Km5bqJJCPH\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Rosie Nguyen isn’t your typical startup founder.

reckoning<\/a>.<\/p>\nOver the past week, we\u2019ve witnessed an alarming amount of layoffs across the startup ecosystem, from buzzy, big names like Cameo, On Deck and Robinhood, to B2B platforms like Workrise and Thrasio. The common thread between most of these layoffs, according to founders, is that there’s been a shift in the market and a serious pivot in business is required. A pivot, that is, that hurts the employees that built your product up after high demand.<\/p>\nA pullback has been in the cards for months. It first impacted public tech companies and then slowly trickled down to late-stage deals and even their well funded early-stage counterparts. In February,"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/02\/10\/virtual-events-platform-hopin-cuts-12-of-staff-citing-goal-of-sustainable-growth\/\">Hopin cut 12% of staff, citing a goal of more sustainable growth<\/a>, while April included"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/04\/05\/workrise-cuts-staff-verticals-after-being-valued-at-2-9b-last-year\/\">Workrise cutting staff and verticals despite a $2.9 billion valuation.<\/a><\/p>\nNow feels like an inflection point, in which tech unicorns are realizing that they may have overpromised a growth trajectory, over-hired or overestimated their ability to raise that next round. They aren’t alluding to the market changing, they’re blaming it. The irony here is tough: The same workforces that helped companies meet a boom in pandemic demand are the same workforces on the chopping block when trends change.<\/p>\nBelow, we’ve listed which companies announced layoffs this week to underscore the unfortunate, albeit growing, trend.<\/p>\nSaaS company Mural cuts dozens of staff<\/h3>\nSoftware-as-a-service startups often get the reputation of being predictable, and therefore perfect for the risk-adverse investor.
"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/04\/21\/why-saas-is-bucking-the-venture-slowdown\/\"> While stable business models have protected SaaS companies<\/a> from the venture slowdown for quite some time, TechCrunch is hearing that digital collaboration startup platform Mural just cut dozens of staff. Per sources and LinkedIn posts from laid-off employees, the layoffs came after a corporate restructuring at the SaaS company. Sales and customer success folks were impacted. Also notably, the reduction comes less than a year after"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/07\/20\/mural-raises-50m-series-c-after-tripling-its-arr-in-the-last-year\/\">Mural raised a $50 million Series C after tripling its ARR.<\/a><\/p>\n"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/05\/04\/cameo-layoff-unicorn\/\">Cameo conducts layoffs a year after hitting unicorn status <\/a><\/h3>\nGetting laid off sucks. Getting laid off sucks even more when your Bored Ape-owning CEO tweets that he made the \u201cpainful decision to let go of 87 beloved members of the Cameo Fameo.\u201d Damn, at least spare them from the corporate nicknaming in your farewell tweet.<\/p>"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\nThese layoffs included teams across all organizations, including several C-suite members. In a statement to TechCrunch, CEO Steven Galanis said that Cameo\u2019s headcount \u201cexploded\u201d from 100 to 400 during pandemic lockdowns, but that now the company \u201cright-sized the business to best reflect the new realities.\u201d<\/p>\nEmployees who spoke to TechCrunch on the condition of anonymity said that they will receive severance packages that include eight weeks of base salary.<\/p>\n"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/04\/26\/robinhood-to-lay-off-9-of-full-time-employees\/\">Robinhood to lay off 9% of full-time employees<\/a><\/h3>\nThe gamified consumer investing app Robinhood cut about 300 employees at the end of April, and like Cameo, the company cited an inability to keep up with early-pandemic acceleration. CEO Vlad Tenev wrote in a"https:\/\/blog.robinhood.com\/news\/2022\/4\/26\/a-message-from-our-ceo-and-co-founder-vlad-tenev\">blog post<\/a> that the company\u2019s headcount grew from 700 to nearly 3,800 from 2019 to 2021.<\/p>\n\u201cAfter carefully considering all these factors, we determined that making these reductions to Robinhood\u2019s staff is the right decision to improve efficiency, increase our velocity, and ensure that we are responsive to the changing needs of our customers,\u201d he added.<\/p>\nDays later, Robinhood announced its Q1 2022 earnings, which"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/04\/29\/robinhoods-sinking-value-is-proof-that-free-can-often-be-very-costly\/\">fell far below<\/a> expectations.<\/p>\n"embed breakout\">\n"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"XBZ9VMgjO0\">"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/05\/04\/robinhood-rolls-out-stock-lending-margin-diversify-revenue\/\">Robinhood to let users lend out their shares in its attempt to diversify revenue<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"“Robinhood to let users lend out their shares in its attempt to diversify revenue” — TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/05\/04\/robinhood-rolls-out-stock-lending-margin-diversify-revenue\/embed\/#?secret=G3SG1wQCyp#?secret=XBZ9VMgjO0\" data-secret=\"XBZ9VMgjO0\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/05\/05\/on-deck-lay-off-accelerator\/\">On Deck cuts 25% of staff, scales back accelerator<\/a><\/h3>\nOn Deck, a tech company that connects founders, laid off about 72 people this week, which amounts to about 25% of staff.<\/p>\nIn an email obtained by TechCrunch, co-founders Erik Torenberg and David Booth explained to staff that the market has \u201cshifted dramatically\u201d since 2021, when On Deck launched its ODX accelerator program. This program gives early-stage startups $125,000 in exchange for 7% of the company, backing over 150 companies to date, bringing the total investment to almost $19 million. But sources close to the company said that ODX will likely be scaled back or even shut down.<\/p>\nTechCrunch\u2019s sources also alleged that the company was attempting to raise a fund between $100 and $150 million, but in reality, they landed a fund closer to $40 million, leaving them with just nine months of runway. Hence, layoffs, mostly in operations and investing roles.<\/p>\nOn Deck\u2019s severance packages include eight weeks of paid base salary and 12 weeks of healthcare.<\/p>\n"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/05\/02\/amazon-aggregator-thrasio-begins-layoffs-names-new-ceo\/\">Amazon aggregator Thrasio begins layoffs, names new CEO<\/a><\/h3>\nThrasio\u2019s business model is to buy up and consolidate third-party Amazon sellers, but apparently, that strategy is rife with ups and downs. After being rumored to go public, Thrasio raised $1 billion in funding last year, valuing the company at $10 billion.<\/p>\nIn a memo to employees, the company implied it was growing too big, too quickly.<\/p>\n\u201cNow, as we assess our strategy for the road ahead, we need to take the time to properly absorb and grow the businesses we have acquired, make sure we have rigorous processes and controls, and then look to re-scale our team in the optimal areas for growth,\u201d the note said.<\/p>\nThrasio\u2019s internal shake-up doesn\u2019t end with layoffs, though — the aggregator is also installing Greg Greeley as its new CEO.

Blue\/Bloomberg via Getty Images<\/p><\/div><\/p>\nIn response, Smalls directed his opening statement to Senator Graham.<\/p>\n“I think that it’s in your best interest to realize that it’s not a left or right thing. It’s not a Democrat or Republican thing. It’s a workers’ issue,” Small told the senator. “We are the ones that are suffering in the corporations that you’re talking about, […] in the warehouses that you’re talking about. So that’s the reason why I think I was invited today to speak on that behalf, and you should listen, because we do represent your constituents as well.”<\/p>\nHe continued, “The people are the ones that make these corporations go, it’s not the other way around.”<\/p>\nAt Senator Sanders’ urging, Smalls explained the working conditions of the now-unionizing fulfillment center where he used to work. He said that workers commuted from all boroughs of New York, as well as parts of New Jersey, which meant that they would commute for about two and a half hours each way, work a 10- to 12-hour shift, and receive minimal break time. He testified that hundreds of union busters came in from across the country, as well as from overseas. These representatives would host “captive audience” anti-union meetings every 20 minutes with groups of 50 to 60 workers. Smalls said that these captive audience presentations happened four times per week.<\/p>\n“Imagine being a new hire at Amazon. Your second day, you don’t even know your job assignment, and the first thing they do is march you into an anti-union propaganda class,” Smalls said. He added that the facility was plastered with anti-union signs, telling workers to vote no to unionization and emphasizing that unions require a dues expense on the workers’ part.<\/p>\n"embed breakout\">\n"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Just met the President lol he said I got him in trouble \ud83d\ude08 gooooooooooood"https:\/\/twitter.com\/amazonlabor?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@amazonlabor<\/a> \u270a\ud83c\udffd<\/p>\n— Christian Smalls (@Shut_downAmazon)"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Shut_downAmazon\/status\/1522296192406802437?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 5, 2022<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/div>\nThe hearing also addressed the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act, which recently passed in the House.

with"https:\/\/www.penguinrandomhouse.com\/books\/609362\/the-last-graduate-by-naomi-novik\/\">a vicious cliffhanger<\/a>, and all you want to do is gab with other fans about what might happen next, but none of your friends have read the book. You might find fan discussions on Reddit, Tumblr or Discord, but it can be a bit of a crapshoot.<\/p>\nThe founder and CEO of"https:\/\/copperbooks.com\/\">Copper<\/a>, Allison Trowbridge wanted to build a social network that revolves around books, connecting authors and fans through in-app discussions and live events. As"https:\/\/bookshop.org\/books\/twenty-two-letters-to-a-young-woman-searching-for-meaning\/9780718078164\">an author herself<\/a>, she also wanted to help writers find new income streams, whether that’s through ticketed virtual events, or just generating enough conversation around a book that more people buy it.<\/p>\n“You have Twitch for the gamers, and Etsy for the crafters, and Spotify and SoundCloud for the musicians,” Trowbridge said. “Authors have never had a platform that’s built around their needs, and helping them reach an audience and do it in a way that’s authentic and engaging and can scale, but also creates depth in the relationships.”<\/p>\nAuthors on Copper can host FaceTime-like discussions about their work, which they will be able to sell tickets for in a later version of the app. They can also engage in text-based forum discussions with fans, helping deepen their relationship with their readers. The app will always have a free version for both authors and fans, but later this year, Trowbridge wants to create a premium version of the app, which would offer paying users additional features.<\/p>\nCopper is part of a growing crop of companies that want to help connect authors with readers.

Plus, Trowbridge noted, emerging authors are told to never look at the Goodreads reviews of their books (“You’ll never want to write another book again,” she jokes). It might be a useful platform for readers looking for book recommendations, but it’s not the most author-friendly website. Copper hopes to make a product that’s fun and useful for both readers and writers.<\/p>\n“For authors, you’re not just a writer. You’re kind of a micro-entrepreneur,” Trowbridge told TechCrunch. That statement might repulse some literary types, but promotion is a means to an end — unless if you’re an established superstar, you probably don’t have much help marketing the book you worked so hard on.”Once the book is written, you’re really doing a product launch, and you’re spending six months thinking about how to launch this product and sell it to an engaged audience that’s going to to buy it and read it.”<\/p>\nSo far, Copper has secured $2.5 million in pre-seed funding led by Wave Capital, and including key individual investors like former Time Inc. executive Fran Hauser. Bestselling author and Wharton professor Adam Grant has also been a crucial advisor to the project.<\/p>\nAs Copper launches out of private beta on"https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/copper-books\/id1557778850?utm_source=Marketing+Email&utm_medium=Email&utm_campaign=Copper+Books\">iOS<\/a>, the app has a waitlist of 6,000 potential users, half of whom are published authors. Trowbridge says Copper has had “several hundred” of these authors onboard during private beta.<\/p>\nA primary selling point of Copper is the promise of community, but community can’t exist without enough users. So, Copper will face a moment of truth in the coming months as it charges full-speed ahead in the age-old pursuit of user acquisition.<\/p>\n“Ultimately, we want to build the Instagram for book lovers,” Trowbridge said.<\/p>\n"embed breakout\">\n"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"cvqvfsopfs\">"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/09\/21\/folios-24-year-old-founder-is-bootstrapping-a-curated-online-bookstore\/\">Folio’s 24-year-old founder is bootstrapping a curated, online bookstore<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"“Folio’s 24-year-old founder is bootstrapping a curated, online bookstore” — TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/09\/21\/folios-24-year-old-founder-is-bootstrapping-a-curated-online-bookstore\/embed\/#?secret=vOoOMa0LnQ#?secret=cvqvfsopfs\" data-secret=\"cvqvfsopfs\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n"embed breakout\">\n"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"ThsUnBViWU\">"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/05\/02\/amazon-upload-epub-kindle\/\">Amazon is going to make it easier to load your own books onto Kindle<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"“Amazon is going to make it easier to load your own books onto Kindle” — TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/05\/02\/amazon-upload-epub-kindle\/embed\/#?secret=U5OgRbGBP7#?secret=ThsUnBViWU\" data-secret=\"ThsUnBViWU\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Any book lover knows the feeling: The incredible novel you’re reading ends with a vicious cliffhanger, and all you want to do is gab with other fans about what might happen next, but none of your friends have read the book.

Still, these results could be skewed since it’s a holistic report of creators from all genres. Tours and live shows are a huge part of musicians’ income, for example, but Patreon’s data says it makes up just 2% of creators’ income. That’s probably because musicians don’t make up a large portion of Patreon creators (plus, touring hasn’t been too feasible over the last few years because \u2026 you know).<\/p>\nPatreon also surveyed creators about their priorities for future Patreon products. Over the last several months, Patreon executives like CEO Jack Conte and CPO Julian Gutman have said that the company"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/10\/29\/patreon-confirms-its-exploring-crypto-as-a-way-for-creators-to-make-money\/\">has been interested<\/a> in exploring whether crypto tools could help creators make money. Through its Creator Policy Engagement Program, Patreon even"https:\/\/blog.patreon.com\/fall-2021-creator-policy-engagement-update\"> floated the idea<\/a> of creator coins as an avenue for monetization. Gutman"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/12\/21\/patreon-cpo-interview-double-in-size-2022\/\">told TechCrunch<\/a> in December that the company had considered building a small crypto team to examine potential options, but that there weren’t any plans set in stone for a plunge into web3.<\/p>\n\u201cIt\u2019s not, \u2018Hey, let\u2019s go build an NFT platform right now,\u2019 but you know, a couple of folks that are focused on this full time,\u201d Gutman"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/12\/21\/patreon-cpo-interview-double-in-size-2022\/\">said at the time<\/a>. \u201cAnd by the way, they might conclude, \u2018Hey, you know what, there\u2019s nothing for us to build here right now,\u2019 which is a totally fine, reasonable conclusion.\u201d<\/p>\nBut feedback from the creator census showed that 43% of creators are strongly against crypto payments, while 30% said they don’t care.

Josh Wardle made a fun little word game for his partner, shared it with some friends (who happened to be some influential tech people, since Wardle has worked at places like Reddit and MSCHF), who shared it with some more friends, and eventually it was all anyone with an internet connection could talk about.<\/p>\nAt first, Wardle wasn’t trying to profit off his ad-free, lightweight word game. But being solely responsible for a viral word game is a big commitment, so at the end of January, he"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/01\/31\/popular-puzzle-game-wordle-is-being-purchased-by-the-new-york-times\/\">sold the game to The New York Times<\/a> for an undisclosed amount in the “low seven figures.”<\/p>\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve followed along with the story of Wordle, you\u2019ll know that NYT games play a big part in its origins and so this step feels very natural to me,” Wardle said in a"https:\/\/twitter.com\/powerlanguish\/status\/1488263944309731329\">tweet<\/a>. “When the game moves to the NYT site, it will be free to play for everyone, and I am working with them to make sure your wins and streaks will be preserved.\u201d<\/p>\nAbout three months after Wordle’s sale to The New York Times, the paper"https:\/\/nytco-assets.nytimes.com\/2022\/05\/NYT-Press-Release-3.27.2022-Final-O2ACvs2.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">announced<\/a> that the game brought “an unprecedented tens of millions of new users to The Times.” This drove the company’s best quarter ever for net subscriber additions to Games. Even though Wordle remains free, The New York Times has been covertly advertising its other games like Spelling Bee through Wordle. A subscription to New York Times Games costs $5 per month, or $40 per year.<\/p>\nWhen Wardle spoke to TechCrunch weeks before the acquisition, he noted that New York Times Games served as an inspiration for the game. Unlike past viral games — think"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2014\/02\/01\/developer-behind-flappy-bird-the-impossible-game-blowing-up-the-app-store-says-he-just-got-lucky\/\">Flappy Bird<\/a> — the game isn’t addicting, as you cannot play more than once each day. That game design is intentional.<\/p>\n“My partner and I play a lot of The New York Times word games, and they follow that one-a-day model,” he"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/01\/12\/josh-wardle-interview-wordle\/\">told TechCrunch<\/a>.<\/p>"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\nAlso similar to The Times, Wordle forges a sense of community among players, since everyone is solving the same puzzle. Wardle added, “One thing that is interesting to reflect on, though, is that Wordle could be one a day, but if everybody was getting a different word on that day \u2014 if the word was random but you could still only play one \u2014 it wouldn\u2019t have caught on the way it has.”<\/p>\nBut perhaps what propelled Wordle to an unexpected level of virality is the ease of sharing your Wordle results emoji grid.<\/p>\nPeople share their Wordle results in WhatsApp chats, Facebook posts and texts to their mom, but Twitter played a significant role in its popularity too.<\/p>\nTwitter data scientist Lauren Fratamico published a"https:\/\/blog.twitter.com\/engineering\/en_us\/topics\/insights\/2022\/understanding-twitter-conversations--a-wordle-case-study\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">case study<\/a> yesterday examining how Wordle spread on the platform over time.<\/p>\n"attachment_2311977\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">"caption-attachment-2311977\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2311977\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Screen-Shot-2022-05-04-at-10.44.17-AM.png?w=680\" alt=\"A graph showing the growth of Wordle on Twitter -- it peaks in January\" width=\"680\" height=\"352\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Screen-Shot-2022-05-04-at-10.44.17-AM.png 1416w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Screen-Shot-2022-05-04-at-10.44.17-AM.png?resize=150,78 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Screen-Shot-2022-05-04-at-10.44.17-AM.png?resize=300,155 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Screen-Shot-2022-05-04-at-10.44.17-AM.png?resize=768,397 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Screen-Shot-2022-05-04-at-10.44.17-AM.png?resize=680,352 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Screen-Shot-2022-05-04-at-10.44.17-AM.png?resize=50,26 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/>"caption-attachment-2311977\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image Credits:<\/strong>"https:\/\/blog.twitter.com\/engineering\/en_us\/topics\/insights\/2022\/understanding-twitter-conversations--a-wordle-case-study\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Twitter"screen-reader-text\">(opens in a new window)<\/span><\/a><\/p><\/div><\/p>\nThe study revealed that 3.3 million people have tweeted about Wordle since mid-October for a total of 32.2 million tweets.
