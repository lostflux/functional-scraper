AdvertisementStructures of rhodopsin in complex with G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 1Naturevolume595,pages600–605 (2021)Cite this article9870Accesses19Citations65AltmetricMetricsdetailsSubjectsAbstractG-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) kinases (GRKs) selectively phosphorylate activated GPCRs, thereby priming them for desensitization1. Although it is unclear how GRKs recognize these receptors2,3,4, a conserved region at the GRK N terminus is essential for this process5,6,7,8. Here we report a series of cryo-electron microscopy single-particle reconstructions of light-activated rhodopsin (Rho*) bound to rhodopsin kinase (GRK1), wherein the N terminus of GRK1 forms a helix that docks into the open cytoplasmic cleft of Rho*. The helix also packs against the GRK1 kinase domain and stabilizes it in an active configuration. The complex is further stabilized by electrostatic interactions between basic residues that are conserved in most GPCRs and acidic residues that are conserved in GRKs. We did not observe any density for the regulator of G-protein signalling homology domain of GRK1 or the C terminus of rhodopsin. Crosslinking with mass spectrometry analysis confirmed these results and revealed dynamic behaviour in receptor-bound GRK1 that would allow the phosphorylation of multiple sites in the receptor tail. We have identified GRK1 residues whose mutation augments kinase activity and crosslinking with Rho*, as well as residues that are involved in activation by acidic phospholipids. From these data, we present a general model for how a small family of protein kinases can recognize and be activated by hundreds of different GPCRs.

MainThe activation of GPCRs instigates intracellular signalling cascades that modulate a vast array of cellular processes9. Desensitization of these GPCRs is triggered by a small family of GRKs, which selectively phosphorylate either the third cytoplasmic loop or the C-terminal tail of activated receptors, thereby triggering the recruitment of arrestins and, typically, clathrin-mediated endocytosis1. Because maladaptive overexpression of GRKs exacerbates conditions such as heart failure and cancer, GRKs have emerged as potentially important therapeutic targets10,11.
The seven vertebrate GRKs (GRK1–GRK7) belong to the AGC kinase family and as such contain a protein kinase domain followed by a C-terminal extension (C-tail) (Fig.
1a). Located centrally within the C-tail is the active site tether (AST), a loop that contributes to the ATP binding site12. The GRK kinase domain is inserted into a loop of a regulator of G-protein signalling homology (RH) domain—a bi-lobed helical bundle that bridges the small and large lobes of the kinase domain13. GRKs also feature a highly conserved, about 16-residue element at their extreme N termini. Truncation, antibody blockade, or mutation of this element can result in complete loss of activity towards receptor substrates5,6,7,8(Extended Data Table1). However, the mechanism by which GRKs recognize and are in turn activated by GPCRs has remained unresolved2. Recent technical advances in cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) have greatly facilitated the determination of structures of GPCRs in complex with heterotrimeric G proteins and arrestins14,15,16,17,18, which also selectively recognize activated GPCRs. Unfortunately, analogous GPCR–GRK structures are currently lacking, probably because such complexes are transient, dependent on anionic lipids, and of low- to mid-micromolar affinity19.

d, Light dependence of the crosslinking reaction.
e, Crosslinking in the presence of Sgv was progressively inhibited by increasing amounts (10–630 μM) of the GRK inhibitor CCG224062 (IC50= 0.1 nM)26, which stabilizes an inactive kinase domain conformation. For gel source data forc–e, see Supplementary Fig.
5a–c.
f, The purified, crosslinked Rho*−GRK1 complex showed an absorption peak at 380 nm, consistent with rhodopsin being stabilized in its Meta II state.
Rhodopsin and GRK120,21have co-evolved in the rod outer segments (ROSs) of photoreceptors to regulate scotopic vision since the emergence of vertebrates, and as such represent a highly optimized system for studying the GPCR–GRK interaction. Here we report four cryo-EM structures of the bovine Rho*–GRK1 complex ranging from 7 to 4 Å resolution, crosslinking with mass spectroscopy (CLMS) analysis, and functional studies that reveal the molecular mechanism by which GRKs recognize activated GPCRs and provide a rare glimpse of a protein kinase being allosterically activated by its physiological substrate.
Isolation of the Rho*–GRK1 complexWe first determined that the Michaelis constant (Km) of GRK1 for Rho* in lauryl maltose-neopentyl glycol (LMNG) micelles was sixfold lower than in native ROS membranes (Km> 5.8 μM), and that the addition of 5% c8- phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (c8-PtdIns(4,5)P2) further decreased theKmtwofold, to 0.33 μM. By contrast, theKmfor ATP remained constant (Fig.
1b, Extended Data Fig.
1a). We also documented a substantial increase in the activity of GRK1 against Rho* when incorporated into nanodiscs containing negatively charged lipids (Extended Data Fig.
1b, c), and then identified a cluster of basic residues in the GRK1 α0 helix, which bridges the small lobe and RH domain, that are involved in this activation (Supplementary Discussion, Extended Data Fig.
1c–e). Despite these improvements in apparent affinity and activity, we still could not purify an intact complex. Treating Rho* reconstituted in c8-PtdIns(4,5)P2+ LMNG micelles with the amine crosslinkers DC422and MC423trapped a super-shifted species of about 100 kDa, consistent with the anticipated 1:1 Rho* (40 kDa)–GRK1 (61 kDa) complex24(Fig.
1c). Crosslinking was most efficient in the presence of sangivamycin (Sgv), an adenosine analogue with a 180 nM inhibition constant (Ki) against GRK125that was previously used to trap GRK6 in what was proposed to be an active configuration6. Dark-adapted rhodopsin failed to crosslink (Fig.
1d) and an active site-directed small molecule inhibitor (CCG224062) that stabilizes GRKs in an inactive state26competed with crosslinking in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.
1e). The absorption spectrum of the purified complex also confirmed the presence of metarhodopsin II (Meta II), the active form of rhodopsin (Fig.
1f). Thus, the isolated Rho*−GRK1 complex was dependent on the activated state of both GPCR and GRK. Crosslinking did not strongly depend on the phosphorylation status of Rho* or whether its C-terminal tail was truncated (Extended Data Fig.
1f, g).
Cryo-EM analysisThis purified complex (Supplementary Fig.
1) was vitrified for cryo-EM analysis, yielding a 7 Å severely anisotropic reconstruction (Fig.
2a, Extended Data Fig.
2, Extended Data Table2). Interpretation of this map (Supplementary Discussion) suggested that affinity could be improved if GRK1 residues Ser5, Ser488, and Thr489, which are endogenous sites of autophosphorylation, were substituted with glutamic acids (GRK1(S5E/EE)). This variant had a decreasedKmfor Rho* and enhanced crosslinking yield, and improved the cryo-EM reconstruction to 5.8 Å (Fig.
2b, Extended Data Fig.
3, Extended Data Table2). Two antigen-binding fragments (Fab1 and Fab6), selected against Sgv-bound GRK1, were then added to the Rho*–GRK1(S5E/EE) complex to increase particle size (by 50 kDa) and aid in particle alignment. These Fabs bind GRK1 with a low nanomolar affinity but have no effect on kinase activity towards Rho* (Extended Data Fig.
1h, i). Imaging of the Fab1 and Fab6 complexes yielded approximately 4 Å resolution cryo-EM reconstructions (Fig.
2c, d, Extended Data Figs.
4,5, Extended Data Table2, Supplementary Videos1,2). However, the data still showed a high degree of dynamic behaviour and a preferred orientation. When GRK1 in the Fab6 complex is superimposed with GRK1 in the other three structures, Rho* differs in orientation by about 5.5° relative to the small lobe (Extended Data Fig.
5e). It is unclear how Fab6 stabilizes this unique state. Density for Rho* is superior in the Fab1 complex, whereas density for intracellular loop 1 (ICL1) and helix 8 (H8) of Rho* are weak in the Fab6 complex. The overall density for GRK1 is, however, superior in the Fab6 complex.

e, PC analysis is consistent with a transition state-like conformation of the GRK1 kinase domain while in complex with Rho*. Each circle represents an individual experimental structure of the PKA kinase domain (grey, active; pink, inactive) or of the kinase domain from a member of one of the three GRK subfamilies: GRK1 (representing GRK1 and 7; various colours for active states, dark blue, inactive), GRK2 (GRK2 and 3; green, inactive), and GRK4 (GRK4, 5 and 6; black, active; red, inactive). Each structure was projected into the PC1–PC2 subspace, wherein PC1 and PC2 represent the directions with the largest conformational variance (67% and 10%, respectively). Molecular dynamics flexible fitting (MDFF) models 1–6 (Supplementary Table1) of Rho*−GRK1 are coloured cyan, those of Rho*−GRK1(S5E/EE) dark cyan, Rho*−GRK1(S5E/EE)−Fab1 (Fab1) magenta, and Rho*−GRK1(S5E/EE)−Fab6 (Fab6) purple. PDB entry 1L3R is the transition state-like structure of PKA, 3NYN and 3NYO correspond to GRK6·Sgv/AMP complexes, and 6PJX is the Ca2+·CaM–GRK5 complex. PC1 and PC2 conformational changes are depicted in Supplementary Videos3and4, respectively.
f, Overlay of basal (PDB entry 1F8850), GRK1-bound (7MTA), transducin-bound (6OYA14), and arrestin-1 bound (5W0P31) Rho*. Key differences between GRK1-bound and transducin or arrestin-1-bound Rho* structures are indicated with arrows.
Structure of the Rho*–GRK1 complexIn all reconstructions, the conformation of Rho* closely resembles that in its complex with transducin and arrestin-1 (root mean square deviations (r.m.s.d.) of 0.8 and 0.7 Å for 278 and 280 Cα atoms, respectively). The Rho* model spans residues 1–324, ending after H8, and the density was consistent with the presence of all-transretinal, although strong density was observed only for the ionone ring (Extended Data Fig.
6a), consistent with the fact that excess 11-cisretinal consistently increased crosslinking yield (Extended Data Fig.
6b). The GRK1 models contain residues 6–24 (comprising a single helix, αN), residues 182–508 (the kinase domain and C-tail), and Sgv, for which there is strong density in all reconstructions (Extended Data Fig.
6a). Density for residues 491–508 is weak, implying that this region is highly dynamic. Density was entirely lacking for the RH domain (Extended Data Fig.
6c), and its positional heterogeneity in the complex is also evident in negative-stain EM 2D class averages (Extended Data Fig.
6d).
In GRK1, αN packs against the AST and the small lobe, similar to its configuration in the GRK6·Sgv6and Ca2+·CaM–GRK527complexes (Extended Data Fig.
7a–d). GRK1-Asn12 is positioned to form hydrogen bonds with the side chain of GRK1-Arg191 on the small lobe—a position that is invariant in GRKs but not in other AGC kinases, and is essential for both GPCR and peptide phosphorylation5,28(Extended Data Table1)—and with GRK1-Asn480 in the AST (Fig.
3a, b). Consistent with this, the GRK1(N12A) mutation markedly reduced crosslinking (Fig.
3d). GRK1-Phe15 and GRK1-Phe22 are positioned to form hydrophobic contacts with hydrophobic residues in the small lobe and AST (Fig.
3c). Principal component (PC) analysis indicated that the GRK1 kinase domain is in a more active state (based on the dominant component PC1) in the Fab1 complex than in the other three reconstructions or in crystal structures of Sgv-bound GRK66and GRK527,29,30(Fig.
2e, Extended Data Fig.
7f–h). The differences in domain closure among the four reconstructions is likely to result from the high degree of dynamics in the complex, both in the hinge of the kinase domain and in the GRK interface with Rho*, consistent with the heterogeneous local resolution of the Fab1 and Fab6 complex maps (Extended Data Figs.
4d,5d).

g, Interaction of GRK1(S5E/EE) with ICL1 of Rho*. Ser488 and Thr489 are autophosphorylation sites in GRK1 that are replaced by phosphomimetic glutamic acid residues in GRK1(S5E/EE).
The Rho*–GRK1 interfaces in the Fab1 and Fab6 complexes bury 1,600 and 1,300 Å2of accessible surface area, respectively, comparable to and overlapping with that buried in transducin14and arrestin-131complexes with Rho* (1,100 and 1,400 Å2, respectively). Deviations in the backbone structure of GRK1-bound Rho* compared with transducin-bound or arrestin-1-bound Rho* (Fig.
2f, Supplementary Fig.
2) are well supported in the reconstructions. The cytoplasmic ends of Rho* transmembrane (TM) helices 5 and 6 in GRK1-bound Rho* adopt the expected outwards conformation relative to the TM core of dark state rhodopsin32but TM6 is rotated away from its position in rhodopsin by about 20° in the GRK1 complex, roughly 4° further than in the other two complexes, resulting in a shift of up to about 3 Å at the end of ICL3. This difference seems mandated by contacts formed by αN and residues 474 and 475 in the AST loop of GRK1 with TM5, TM6, and ICL3. Rho* H8 is also shifted away from the receptor core by about 2 Å relative to the arrestin and transducin complexes. The end of TM1 and the first half of ICL1 shift with H8 (more so in Fab6 than Fab1). Key drivers for this difference may be the electrostatic interactions formed between the AST and ICL1, and the contacts between the N terminus of αN in GRK1 and H8. The end result is a wider, more open cytoplasmic cleft in Rho* when bound to GRK1.
Conservation of the Rho*–GRK1 interfaceModelling indicates that the mode of interaction exhibited by the Rho*–GRK1 complex will be compatible with other activated class A receptors such as the β2 adrenergic receptor (β2AR) (Extended Data Fig.
7e,Supplementary Discussion). The most prominent feature in our maps is the αN of GRK1, which docks in the cytoplasmic cleft of Rho* in roughly the same way as the C-terminal helix of transducin14, although with opposite polarity and a trajectory that differs by about 25°, and in a manner that overlaps with the finger loop of arrestin-1 (Extended Data Fig.
7i–p). This is in contrast to several recently proposed receptor docking models for GRKs wherein αN has no direct role in the receptor interface2(Supplementary Discussion). Consistent with the importance of αN and previous studies, we showed that the crosslinking yield of the N-terminal truncations GRK1(ΔN23) and GRK1(ΔN26) was markedly reduced (Fig.
3d, Extended Data Table1). Residues Val9, Val10, and Ile16, which are important for agonist-dependent GPCR phosphorylation5,6,33,34, pack against the hydrophobic inner surfaces of TM3, TM5 and TM6 (Fig.
3e). The V9A and V10A mutations also markedly reduced crosslinking yield (Fig.
3d). Conversely, mutation of Rho*-Leu2265.61or -Val2305.65(superscripts indicate Ballesteros–Weinstein nomenclature) to Ala in TM5 reduce Rho* phosphorylation by GRK135. Although density for GRK1(S5E) was not observed, its side chain would complement those of Rho*-Lys3118.48and -Arg3148.51(Fig.
3f), which are highly conserved in class A GPCRs (Supplementary Fig.
3). An acidic residue is conserved at the position of GRK1-Ser5 in most GRKs (Fig.
3a), and mutation of the homologous residue in GRK2 (D3A/K) substantially reduced its ability to phosphorylate the β2AR33. GRK1-Glu7, which is highly conserved among GRKs but is less important for catalytic activity6,33,34(Extended Data Table1), is positioned so that it could form a salt bridge with Rho*-Arg1353.50, one of the most highly conserved residues in class A receptors (Fig.
3f).
Rho* ICL1 forms more extensive interactions with GRK1 than with either transducin or arrestin-1 and contacts the AST loop near GRK1-Ser488 and Thr489 (Fig.
3g). The rapid autophosphorylation of these residues in vitro or in cells enhances Rho* phosphorylation36,37. In our models, phospho-Ser488 could be coordinated by Rho*-Lys66 and GRK1-Lys225 and Lys491, and phospho-Thr489 by Rho*-Arg69 and GRK1-Lys221 and Arg222 (Fig.
3f). We validated this hypothesis via the GRK1(EE) and GRK1(S5E/EE) mutants, which exhibited lowerKm(S5E/EE) and enhanced crosslinking (EE and S5E/EE) (Extended Data Fig.
8a–g). Autophosphorylation of the homologous residues in GRK5 promotes its activity against activated receptors38,39and GRK2/3 feature a cluster of phosphomimetic residues (DEED) that is predicted to be at its ICL1 contact site (Fig.
3a). Rho*-Lys67 in ICL1 is also positioned so that it could form a salt bridge with GRK1-Glu200 (Fig.
3f), an invariant P-loop residue in GRKs that is conserved as Arg or Lys in most other AGC kinases. The notable number of complementary interactions formed between basic residues in Rho* and acidic residues in GRK1 may explain the well-known sensitivity of GRK-mediated GPCR phosphorylation to ionic strength.
ICL1 is highly conserved in both sequence and structure among class A and B1 GPCRs (Supplementary Fig.
3), and even in cases where these receptors have structural differences, ICL1 retains basic residues that could favourably interact with GRKs and would still be able to bind GRK1 without steric collisions (data not shown). By contrast, class B2 (adhesion), C, and F GPCRs do not have analogous signatures in ICL1 (Supplementary Fig.
4). Class B2 (adhesion) and class F receptors do, however, have conserved basic residues in ICL1, and the recent structure of the adhesion receptor GPR9740suggests that its cytoplasmic cleft and ICL1 would be compatible with GRK binding despite large differences in other parts of the TM core. Class F receptors are difficult to assess for GRK compatibility given their distant structural homology. Notably, class C receptors do not seem to have ICL1 loops that would be compatible with GRK binding, even though metabotropic glutamate receptors are reported to be desensitized by GRKs41,42. In some isoforms, such as metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGlu1), this could occur by non-phosphorylation-dependent mechanisms such as the binding of the RH domain of GRK2 to activated Gαqor directly to the receptor42. Meanwhile, mGlu2 receptors, but not mGlu3 receptors, are resistant to homologous desensitization by GRKs43. Thus, there are complexities among mGluRs in their interactions with GRKs that cannot be explained by sequence comparison alone.
Rho*-ICL2 could not be confidently modelled in complex with GRK1 because of its continuity with the micelle boundary, but it is predicted to interact with the β1 strand region of the small lobe of GRK1 and would collide with GRK1 α0 if the helix were situated as in previous GRK1 crystal structures (Extended Data Fig.
8h). ICL3 contacts AST residues Arg474 and Thr475 (Extended Data Fig.
8i), but mutations at these positions in GRK1 did not measurably affect activity when tested previously5(Extended Data Table1). By virtue of being located at the periphery of the interface, GPCRs with longer ICL3 loops would, however, not only have freedom to dock, but also have easy access to the active site of the bound GRK.
Validation by CLMSThe lysine residues on GRK1 that crosslinked with Rho* were all located on the kinase domain (Fig.
4a, Extended Data Fig.
9, Supplementary Tables2,3). Dead-end analysis, which identifies lysines modified by crosslinker and then quenched with either water or Tris buffer, was consistent with the RH domain not directly contributing to receptor binding because all of its lysines were detected in this analysis (Fig.
4a, cyan spheres; Supplementary Table4). Lysines in the kinase domain that did not react are not accessible to solvent in the observed complex (Fig.
4a), consistent with the idea that a discrete GPCR–GRK complex forms in solution before the addition of crosslinker. Two major crosslinked regions between Rho* and GRK1 were identified (Fig.
4b–d, Supplementary Table2). The first was between Rho*-Lys3118.48and GRK1-Lys479 in the AST (Fig.
4b). The second was between two lysines in the Rho* C terminus and the phosphoacceptor binding cleft of the GRK1 kinase domain. Rho*-Lys325 crosslinks with GRK1-Lys395 in the large lobe (Fig.
4b), whereas Rho*-Lys339 also crosslinks with Lys325 and eight additional sites (Fig.
4c, d, Supplementary Table2). Rho*-Lys339 is positioned between Ser338 and Ser343 (Fig.
4c, d), which are the primary phosphorylation sites in the C terminus of Rho*44. When Ser338 is modelled at the phosphoacceptor site of the kinase domain45, Lys339 can reach six out of the nine lysines in GRK1 identified by CLMS (Fig.
4c). Modelling instead Rho*-Ser343 at the active site places Rho*-Lys339 within range of the remainder of the GRK1 lysines identified (Fig.
4d). Thus, there is a high degree of dynamics in the receptor C terminus, which is consistent with its absence in our reconstructions and with the ability of Rho*-bound GRK1 to phosphorylate multiple sites in the receptor C terminus.

DiscussionOur Rho*–GRK1 reconstructions demonstrate that the few specific interactions formed in the Rho*–GRK1 interface involve sites that are highly conserved in both GRKs and most class A and B1 GPCRs. Our data also indicate that GPCRs activate GRKs by coalescing the αN and AST regions into a bridge that spans the small and large lobes of the kinase domain and stabilizes it in a more closed, catalytically competent state, consistent with early predictions6. GRK1 interacts with multiple regions of Rho* that are known to exhibit conformational changes in other GPCRs upon receptor activation. Despite the modest resolution of our maps, it is clear that these regions are distinct in conformation from those in Rho* complexes with transducin and arrestin-1 (Fig.
2f). Thus, our data indicate that some arrestin-biased ligands might function by stabilizing conformations of the GPCR that are more complementary to GRKs than to G proteins. Comparison with the recent G-protein- and arrestin-bound structures of the M2 muscarinic15,17and neurotensin receptors16,18also suggests that the conformation of Rho* in our structure is unique. We note that among the Rho*-interacting residues in GRK1, only Leu6 is invariant among GRKs. Thus, via ligand-induced changes in conformation, individual GPCRs could also change their selectivity for individual GRKs, leading to installation of distinct phosphorylation ‘barcodes’46,47and hence different physiological outcomes.
Finally, our work provides insights into the overall process by which GRK phosphorylation of activated GPCRs occurs. In our current model, the αN helix of GRK1 is intrinsically disordered until it binds to activated GPCRs in a form of ‘molecular fly-casting’48(Fig.
5). The fact that robust crosslinking to Rho* was not observed in the presence of either ATP or ADP suggests that GPCRs are optimized to bind GRKs in a conformation that is optimized for phosphotransfer, but not for ATP or ADP binding. A fly-casting mechanism would, however, allow for a partially dissociated state of the GRK wherein exchange of ADP for ATP could readily occur and enable further rounds of phosphorylation. Future studies are needed to validate this model and to examine how GRK2 and GRK4 subfamily members interact with receptors from the various GPCR classes, especially those lacking the interaction signatures defined by the Rho*–GRK1 complex.
In its basal state, the GRK kinase domain is in an open conformation with its small and large lobes engaged with both lobes of the RH domain. The N terminus and portions of the AST in the GRK are disordered. A basic region adjacent to the receptor interface (α0 helix region in GRK1) promotes membrane association. Upon receptor activation, the GRK N terminus forms a helix (αN) that docks into the cytoplasmic cleft of the activated GPCR. αN also packs against the small lobe and AST to allosterically trigger kinase domain closure, aligning ATP with the phosphoacceptor in the C tail of GPCR in a transition state-like complex. GRKs may need to dissociate from the receptor at least partially to efficiently exchange adenine nucleotides, and in this state αN and the large lobe could remain bound to the cytoplasmic cleft and the phosphorylated tail of the receptor, respectively, to facilitate additional rounds of phosphorylation. In GRK1, and perhaps in the closely related GRK4 subfamily of GRKs, receptor binding also induces conformation changes that displace the RH domain. This could serve to strengthen membrane interactions mediated by the RH domain and its associated loops, including the α0 helix. GRK2 and GRK3 lack an analogous α0 helix and there is evidence that their RH domains may not be as dynamic in receptor complexes. Pink and red circles indicate GRK autophosphorylation and Rho* phosphorylation sites, respectively.
MethodsNo statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. The experiments were not randomized and investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment.
Expression and purification of GRK1Full-length bovine GRK1 (residues 1–561) has a farnesylation site at its C terminus that limits its expression in insect cells. We therefore used truncated GRK1 (residues 1–535, hereafter referred to simply as GRK1). This variant exhibits slightly decreased kinase activity towards the receptor relative to the wild type35. A His6-tag was added to the C terminus of GRK1 for metal affinity purification49. The mutagenesis and cloning of GRK1 has previously been described34. We used the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system (Invitrogen) to express GRK1 in eitherSpodoptera frugiperdaorTrichoplusia niinsect cells (used without authentication or testing for mycoplasma). For purification, freshly prepared or thawed cell pellets were resuspended in cold lysis buffer (buffer A) containing 20 mM HEPES (pH 8.0), 400 mM NaCl, 2 mM DTT, 0.1 mM PMSF and leupeptin, lima bean trypsin protease inhibitor. The cells were resuspended using a dounce homogenizer and then lysed using an Avestin C3 emulsifier. The lysed cells were centrifuged in a Beckman Ti-45 rotor at 45,000 rpm for 45 min. The supernatant was combined and filtered through a glass filter and loaded onto a 2-ml home-packed Ni2+-NTA column pre-equilibrated with buffer A. The column was then washed with 50 ml buffer A, followed by 50 ml buffer A plus 20 mM imidazole. The bound protein was eluted in approximately 2-ml fractions with buffer A plus 200 mM imidazole. The purity of GRK1535-His6after this step was about 95% as revealed by Coomassie blue staining of samples assessed via SDS–PAGE. The fractions were pooled and concentrated with a 50-kDa cutoff 50-ml centrifugal concentrator (Amicon Ultra) to about 1–2 ml. Then, 0.5 ml of the concentrated sample was injected onto a Superdex 200 Increase column (GE healthcare) equilibrated with buffer containing 20 mM HEPES (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, and 0.5 mM TCEP. The peak fractions were pooled and concentrated to about 10 mg/ml, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C for future use. We produced GRK1 variants (V9A, V10A, N12A, S5E, EE(S488E/T489E), DD(S488D/T489D) and S5E/EE) using the same procedure. For GRK1(ΔN26), GRK1(ΔN23) and GRK(5A) (R31A/R33A/K34A/R38A/K40A), which showed decreased expression levels, an extra ion-exchange step using a 1-ml HiTrap Q column (GE Healthcare) was performed after metal affinity purification. For this step, protein eluted from an Ni2+-NTA column was diluted tenfold with 20 mM HEPES, 2 mM DTT before loading onto the Q column. GRK1 variants were eluted at about 100 mM NaCl.
Preparation of ROS from bovine retinasAll procedures were conducted in a dark room under red light as previously described58. In brief, about 100 retinas were resuspended with about 100 ml of 45% (w/v) sucrose in buffer B containing 70 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 1 mM MgCl2and 0.1 mM EDTA and were shaken vigorously by hand for about 3 min, and then the sample was centrifuged at 5,000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant was filtered through four layers of cheesecloth, diluted 1:1 with buffer B and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min. The pellet was then resuspended with 25.5% sucrose and overlaid on top of two sucrose layers containing 14 ml of 32.25% sucrose with 13 ml of 27.125% sucrose. The sucrose gradient was centrifuged in a swinging bucket rotor (SW-27) at 18,000 rpm for 90 min. ROS settled between the two layers and were collected using a syringe. The collected ROS were washed twice with buffer B to remove sucrose, incubated with 5 M urea for 10 min, and then washed three times with 20 mM HEPES (pH 8.0), 2 mM MgCl2. The ROS were aliquoted and stored at −80 °C for future use.
Preparation of hyper-phosphorylated rhodopsinWe incubated 2 μM of ROS with 100 nM GRK1 under ambient light at room temperature for one hour in a buffer containing 50 mM HEPES (pH 8.0), 500 μM ATP, and 10 mM MgCl2. An γ-P32-ATP standard curve estimated 6–8 phosphates incorporated per rhodopsin, indicating full saturation given that there are only 7 possible sites in the cytoplasmic tail of the receptor. After phosphorylation, the membrane was washed twice with 20 mM HEPES (pH 8.0) and 100 mM NaCl and then incubated with tenfold molar excess of 11-cisretinal in the dark at room temperature for 1 h for the purpose of regeneration.
Preparation of Asp-N treated rhodopsinWe incubated 0.5 mg of ROS with 0.4 μg of Asp-N protease (Roche) overnight at room temperature in the dark. Asp-N treated ROS was washed twice with buffer containing 20 mM HEPES (pH 8.0) and 100 mM NaCl before detergent reconstitution.
Rhodopsin reconstitution in detergent micellesWe added 500 μl of 5 mM LMNG to 100 μg of c8-PtdIns(4,5)P2powder to make 5% (molar ratio) c8-PtdIns(4,5)P2+ LMNG micelles. Rhodopsin reconstitution was performed under dim light in a dark room. We used 400 μl of the c8-PtdIns(4,5)P2+ LMNG solution to dissolve 0.5 mg of rhodopsin in ROS membrane. After incubation on ice for 30 min, the solution was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min to pellet insoluble material. The supernatant, containing rhodopsin solubilized with c8-PtdIns(4,5)P2+ LMNG, was isolated and its concentration assessed using a Bradford assay. The same procedure was followed to reconstitute rhodopsin with LMNG alone.
Rhodopsin reconstitution in nanodiscsAll lipids used for nanodiscs were purchased from Avanti dissolved in chloroform. We mixed 40% 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-l-serine (POPS) or 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1′-rac-glycerol) (POPG) with 60% 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) and the chloroform was dried under a gentle stream of N2. The glass vials containing the mixed lipids were kept in a desiccator overnight to remove any residual chloroform. CHAPS detergent was added to dissolve the lipids until it became a clear solution. Lipids, MSP1D1 and Rho were mixed at a ratio of 360:6:1 in the dark for 30 min. Biobeads were added to the mix and incubated overnight. The reconstituted Rho was loaded onto a Superdex 200 increase column in buffer containing 20 mM HEPES (pH 8.0) and 100 mM NaCl under lighted conditions. The peak fractions containing either empty nanodiscs or nanodiscs with rhodopsin were pooled and concentrated using a 100-kDa cutoff 50-ml centrifugal concentrator (Amicon Ultra). The amount of rhodopsin reconstituted in nanodiscs was determined using Coomassie staining with known amount of rhodopsin as standard.
Crosslinker screeningTo screen for conditions that covalently capture a Rho*−GRK1 complex, 10 μM GRK1 and 10 μM rhodopsin reconstituted with c8-PtdIns(4,5)P2+ LMNG was mixed in the absence or presence of various adenosine analogues (1 mM AMP, 1 mM ADP, 1 mM AMP-PNP, 1 mM ATP, or 0.8 mM Sgv) and incubated in the dark for 20 min on ice. Crosslinkers were dissolved with buffer containing 50 mM HEPES (pH 8.0) and 10 mM MgCl2immediately before use and added to the reaction. The samples were exposed to ambient light on ice for 30 min to activate rhodopsin and SDS sample buffer was used to quench the reaction. The crosslinking result was assessed using Coomassie blue staining of proteins separated by 10% SDS–PAGE. We screened seven crosslinkers: BS3, BS(PEG)5, BM(PEG)2, BM(PEG)3(ThermoFisher) and PC4, DC422and MC423(provided by the Andrews laboratory, University of Michigan). Both DC4 and MC4 successfully crosslinked rhodopsin and GRK1 in the presence of Sgv.
Testing of conditions necessary for crosslinkingThe same experiment used in the crosslinker screening was used to assess the effect of receptor activation and GRK ligands on crosslinking in the presence of 2 mg/ml MC4. To assess the light dependence of crosslinking, one reaction was kept in the dark throughout and was compared with a reaction pre-exposed to light for 30 min. To test the effect of an inhibitor that traps GRK1 in an inactive state, 10 μM GRK1, 10 μM rhodopsin and 0.4 mM Sgv were incubated along with increasing concentrations of CCG224062 (from 0.01 to 0.63 mM) for 20 min in the dark before light activation. All crosslinking experiments were repeated at least three times. For quantification, the density of crosslinked Rho*–GRK1 complex was normalized to the combined density of Rho* and GRK1 without crosslinker as an estimation of crosslinking efficiency and was used to compare between groups.
The purification of the crosslinked Rho*–GRK1 complexAlthough c8-PtdIns(4,5)P2did not significantly enhance the crosslinking between Rho* and GRK1 (Supplementary Fig.
5e), it was kept in the reaction for complex purification. A crosslinking reaction with a total volume of 5.0 ml was set up as described above. We added 50 mM Tris (pH 8.0) to quench the reaction. The reaction mix was loaded onto a 1-ml HiTrap Q column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 20 mM HEPES (pH 8.0), 100 mM NaCl, 0.2 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM LMNG and 20 μM Sgv. GRK1 and crosslinked Rho*−GRK1 complex were eluted over a gradient of 100–200 mM NaCl. Rhodopsin and self-crosslinked rhodopsin eluted at 500 mM NaCl. The fractions containing primarily crosslinked Rho*−GRK1 complex and some GRK1 were pooled together and concentrated with a 100-kDa cutoff 50-ml concentrator (Amicon Ultra) to about 400 μl. The concentrated sample was loaded onto a Superdex 200 Increase column equilibrated with 20 mM HEPES (pH 8.0), 100 mM NaCl, 0.2 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM LMNG and 20 μM Sgv. The crosslinked Rho*−GRK1 complex eluted at a volume consistent with a 150-kDa globular protein and was pooled for EM and CLMS analysis. The yellow colour of the final sample was consistent with the retention of all-transretinal in the sample, and also showed an absorption peak at 380 nM, indicating that Rho* was in the Meta II state (Fig.
1f).
Michaelis–Menten kinetic analysisIn Fig.
1band Extended Data Fig.
1a,KmandVmaxfor Rho* were determined by varying Rho* concentrations from 0.05 to 6 μM for ROS and from 0.02 to 2.5 μM for rhodopsin reconstituted in LMNG or c8-PtdIns(4,5)P2+ LMNG. The lower concentration range used for rhodopsin reconstituted with detergent was necessary because GRK1 kinase activity is inhibited by detergent at high concentrations. The reactions contain 50 nM GRK1, 20 μM ATP (500 Ci/mol) and 50 mM HEPES (pH 8.0), 10 mM MgCl2.
KmandVmaxfor ATP were determined by varying ATP concentrations from about 0.16 to 20 μM (500 Ci/mol) in reactions containing 50 nM GRK1, 1 μM rhodopsin, 50 mM HEPES (pH 8.0) and 10 mM MgCl2. Rhodopsin was activated under an ambient light for 1 min before the reaction. The reaction proceeded for 2 min at room temperature and was quenched with SDS sample buffer. Rho* and GRK1 were separated by SDS–PAGE and the extent of phosphorylation was assessed using image analysis with the Quantity One program (BioRad) on phosphor screens. Plots of initial velocity versus concentration of the varied substrates were fit to the Michaelis–Menten equation using GraphPad prism. For Extended Data Fig.
1b, the same procedure was performed as described above except that the range of ROS was varied from 0.15 to 18 μM when determining theKmandVmaxfor Rho*. When comparing how nanodiscs affected GRK1 kinetics, lower amounts of Rho* were used. For Extended Data Fig.
8c–e, the same procedure was performed as described above except that the reaction contained 0.1 μM rhodopsin instead of 1 μM when determining theKmandVmaxfor ATP.
Analysis of tubulin phosphorylation by GRK1 and mutantsPhosphorylation reactions contained 5 μM tubulin (PurSolutions), 50 nM GRK1, 5 μM ATP, 50 mM HEPES (pH 8.0) and 10 mM MgCl2. The reaction was quenched at 2, 5, 10, 20 and 30 min with SDS sample buffer. Tubulin and GRK1 were separated by SDS–PAGE and the extent of phosphorylation was assessed using image analysis with the Quantity One program (BioRad) on phosphor screens. This assay was repeated three times.
Preparation of biotinylated GRK1An Avi-tag was added to the GRK1 C terminus after the His6-tag. The same procedures used to produce GRK1 as described above were used to generate Avi-tagged GRK1. BirA500 kit (Avidity) was used to biotinylate Avi-tagged GRK1. In brief, 2 mg Avi-tagged GRK1 was incubated with 8 μl biotin ligase, 80 μl biomix A and 80 μl biomix B supplied from the kit overnight on ice. The biotinylated GRK1 was loaded onto a Superdex 200 Increase column with buffer containing 20 mM HEPES (pH 8.0), 100 mM NaCl and 0.2 mM TCEP. The monomeric peak was collected and concentrated using a 50-kDa cutoff 50-ml concentrator (Amicon Ultra) to about 10 mg/ml. The biotinylation efficiency was estimated to be close to 100% by pull-down experiments using Streptavidin magnetic beads.
Phage display selectionsSgv-bound biotinylated GRK1 was used as target for phage display selection, performed at 4 °C according to published protocols59in a selection buffer supplemented with 10 μM Sgv. In brief, in the first round, 100 nM of target was immobilized on 250 μl of magnetic beads. Then, 100 μl of a phage library E60containing 1012–1013virions was added to the Streptavidin beads and incubated for 30 min. The resuspended beads containing bound virions were washed extensively and then used to infect freshly grown log-phaseEscherichia coliXL1-Blue cells (Agilent). Phages were amplified overnight in 2 × YT medium with 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 109plaque-forming units (PFU) per ml of M13-KO7 helper phage. To increase the stringency of selection, three additional rounds of sorting were performed with the target concentration decreasing in each round (second round: 50 nM, third round: 10 nM and fourth round: 10 and 5 nM) using the amplified pool of virions of the preceding round as the input. Selection from the second to fourth rounds was done on a Kingfisher instrument using a solution capture method wherein the target was premixed with the amplified phage pool and then Streptavidin beads were added to the mixture. From the second round onwards, the bound phages were eluted using 0.1 M glycine (pH 2.7). This elution technique often risks the elution of non-specific and Streptavidin binders, which tend to overpopulate the amplified phage pool and thereby reduce the chance to obtain the desired specific clones. To eliminate them, the precipitated virions from the second round onwards were negatively selected against 100 μl of Streptavidin beads before adding to the target. The pre-cleared phage pool was then used as an input for the selection.
Single-point phage ELISAAll enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) experiments were performed at 4 °C in 96-well plates coated with 50 μl of 2 μg/ml neutravidin in Na2CO3buffer (pH 9.6) and subsequently blocked by 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS. A single-point phage ELISA was used to rapidly screen the binding of the obtained Fab fragments in phage format. Colonies ofE. coliXL1-Blue harbouring phagemids from the fourth round of selection were inoculated directly into 500 μl of 2 × YT broth supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and M13-KO7 helper phage. The cultures were grown overnight at 37 °C in a 96-deep-well block plate. HBS with 0.05% (v/v) Tween-20 supplemented with 10 μM Sgv was used in the ELISA. Culture supernatants containing Fab phage were diluted tenfold in HBST buffer in the presence of 10 μM Sgv. After 15 min of incubation, the mixtures were transferred to ELISA plates that were incubated with 30 nM biotinylated GRK1 in experimental wells and with buffer in control wells for 15 min. The ELISA plates were incubated with the phage for another 15 min and then washed with ELISA buffer. The washed ELISA plates were incubated with a 1:1 mixture of mouse anti-M13 monoclonal antibody (cat: 27-9420-01, GE, 1:5,000 dilution in ELISA buffer) and peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (cat: 115-035-003, Jackson Immunoresearch, 1:5,000 dilution in ELISA buffer) for 30 min. The plates were again washed, developed with TMB substrate and then quenched with 1.0 M HCl, and the absorbance at 450 nm was determined. The background binding of the phage was monitored by the absorbance from the control wells.
Sequencing, cloning, overexpression and purification of Fab fragmentsFrom phage ELISA, clones (selected on the basis of a high ratio of ELISA signal of target binding to background) were sequenced at the DNA Sequencing Facility at the University of Chicago. Unique clones were sub-cloned in pRH2.2, an IPTG inducible vector for the expression of Fabs inE. coli.
Escherichia coliC43 cells were transformed with sequence-verified clones of Fab fragments in pRH2.2. Fab fragments were grown in TB autoinduction medium with 100 μg/ml ampicillin overnight at 30 °C. Collected cells were kept frozen at −80 °C until use. Frozen pellets were re-suspended in PBS supplemented with 1 mM PMSF and 1 μg/ml DNaseI. The suspension was lysed by ultrasonication. The cell lysate was incubated at 65 °C for 30 min to eliminate any undesired proteolysed fragments of the Fab produced during overexpression. Heat-treated lysate was then cleared by centrifugation, filtered through 0.22-μm filter and loaded onto a HiTrap Protein L 5-ml column pre-equilibrated with lysis buffer (20 mM HEPES buffer, pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl). The column was washed with 10 column volumes of lysis buffer followed by elution of Fab fragments with elution buffer (0.1 M acetic acid). Fractions containing protein were directly loaded onto a Resource S 1-ml column pre-equilibrated with buffer A (50 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.0) followed by washing with 10 column volumes of buffer A. Fab fragments were eluted with a linear gradient 0–50% of buffer B (50 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.0, 2.0 M NaCl). Affinity and ion-exchange chromatography were performed using an automated program on an ÄKTA explorer system. Purified Fab fragments were dialysed overnight against 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.4) and 150 mM NaCl. The quality of purified Fab fragments was analysed by SDS–PAGE.
Multipoint protein ELISA for EC50determinationMultipoint ELISA was performed at 4 °C to estimate the affinity of the Fabs to GRK1. HBS with 0.05% (v/v) Tween-20 supplemented with 10 μM Sgv was used as the ELISA buffer. We incubated 30 nM of Sgv-bound biotinylated GRK1 immobilized on a neutravidin-coated ELISA plate with threefold serial dilutions of the purified Fabs starting from 4 μM for 20 min. The plates were washed, and the bound GRK1–Fab complexes were incubated with a secondary HRP-conjugated Pierce recombinant protein L (cat: 32420, Thermofisher, 1:5,000 dilution in ELISA buffer) for 30 min. The plates were again washed, developed with TMB substrate and quenched with 1.0 M HCl, and absorbance at 450 nm was measured. To determine the affinities, the data were fitted in a dose–response sigmoidal function in GraphPad PRISM and EC50values were calculated.
Cryo-EM sample preparation and image acquisitionPurified Rho*−GRK1(S5E/EE) complex at about 0.3 mg/ml was incubated with 1.2 molar excess of Fab1 or Fab6 for 20 min before freezing. Grids of Rho*−GRK1, Rho*−GRK1(S5E/EE), Rho*−GRK1(S5E/EE)−Fab1, or Rho*−GRK1(S5E/EE)−Fab6 were prepared using the same procedure. Samples at about 0.3 mg/ml were applied onto glow-discharged 300 mesh grids (Quantifoil R1.2/1.3) and plunge-frozen into liquid ethane using a FEI Vitrobot Mark IV (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Data were collected on a Titan Krios electron microscope operated at 300 kV using Leginon61with a nominal magnification of 81,000× (resulting in a calibrated physical pixel size of 1.08 Å/pixel) and a defocus range of 1.2–2.5 μm. The images were recorded on a K3 summit electron direct detector (Gatan) in super-resolution mode at the end of a GIF-Quantum energy filter (Gatan) operated with a slit width of 20 eV. A dose rate of 20 e−/pix/s and an exposure time of 3.12 s were used, generating 40 movie frames with a total dose of about 54 electrons per Å2.
EM data processingFor the Rho*−GRK1 complex reconstruction, movie frames were imported to RELION-362and aligned using MotionCor263with binning factor of 2. Contrast transfer function (CTF) parameters were estimated using Gctf64. Laplacian-of-Gaussian picking was used to pick about 2.68 million particles, which were extracted from the dose-weighted micrographs. The dataset was split into batches for multiple rounds of 2D classifications to exclude bad particles that fell into 2D averages with poor features. After this cleaning step, 705,966 particles remained. Particles from different views were used to generate an initial model in cryoSPARC65. Further 3D classification with three classes was performed to select the class with resolvable secondary structure features. The selected 183,717 particles were used for final 3D refinement in RELION-362, converging at 7 Å global resolution, as determined by the Fourier shell correlation (FSC) criterion in RELION-3 PostProcess62. The data processing workflow is shown in Extended Data Fig.
2. For the Rho*−GRK1(S5E/EE), Rho*−GRK1(S5E/EE)−Fab1 and Rho*−GRK1(S5E/EE)−Fab6 complexes, the movie frames were first motion-corrected using MotionCor263with binning factor of 2 and then imported into cryoSPARC65. CTF parameters were estimated using patch CTF. Blob Picker was used to pick from 100 micrographs and the selected particles were processed via 2D classification. The good 2D classes were selected and used as templates for Template Picker to pick particles from all micrographs. The picked particles were extracted from the dose-weighted micrographs. Multiple rounds of 2D classifications were performed to exclude bad particles that fell into 2D averages with poor features. The remaining particles from different views were used to generate an initial model in cryoSPARC65. For Rho*−GRK1(S5E/EE), particles were imported into RELION-362and further 3D classification with six classes was performed to select the class with resolvable secondary structure features. The selected 132,721 particles were used for final 3D refinement in RELION-362, converging at 5.8 Å global resolution, as determined by the FSC criterion in RELION-3 PostProcess62. The data-processing workflow is shown in Extended Data Fig.
3. For Rho*−GRK1(S5E/EE)−Fab1 or Rho*−GRK1(S5E/EE)−Fab6 complexes, heterogenous refinement with three classes was performed to select the class with resolvable secondary structure features in cryoSPARC65. The selected particles were used for homogenous refinement, followed by non-uniform refinement, converging at about 4 Å global resolution, as determined by the FSC criterion in cryoSPARC65. The data-processing workflows are shown in Extended Data Figs.
4and5, respectively. Directional FSC was performed by an online 3DFSC server to evaluate the resolution in different directions66. A number of factors prevented further improvement of the current resolution, including the small size and intrinsic flexibility of the complex, as well as preferred orientations.
PC analysisPC analysis of GRK kinase domain conformations30,67was recalculated on the basis of an updated dataset, as follows. Four GRK2 structures published since the last analysis (PDB entries 5UVC, 5UUU, 6C2Y, and 6U7C) were added to the previous PKA (201 structures) and GRK (59 structures) dataset, and the kinase domains of the structures were aligned using the structurally invariant core residues identified previously30. PCs were calculated using equivalent kinase domain Cα atoms of all structures excluding the new Rho*-bound GRK1 structures generated by MDFF and the recent GRK5 −Ca2+·CaM structure PDB entry 6PJX. All structures (including the new models and 6PJX) were then projected into the subspace spanned by the two PCs that captured the largest structural variance (that is, PC1 and PC2, which in total capture 77.2% of total variance) for inter-structure comparisons. Each PC axis represents a linear combination of Cartesian coordinates (in Å), where the origin represents the mean conformation of all structures used to compute PCs.
Negative-stain EMFor negative-stain EM, 4 μl of Rho*–GRK1 complex was added to a glow discharged 400-mesh copper grid covered with carbon-coated collodion film (EMS). Grids were washed in one drop of water, stained in three drops of uranyl formate (0.75%) (EMS) and air dried. Samples were visualized on a Tecnai T12 electron microscope (FEI) at an acceleration voltage of 120 kV under low-dose conditions. Images were taken at a magnification of 71,138× at a defocus value of −1.4 μm and recorded on a Gatan US4000 CCD camera (Gatan). Images were converted to mixed raster content format and binned (2 × 2 pixels), resulting in final images with a pixel size of 4.16 Å/pixel at the specimen level. A total of 18,227 particle projections were excised using Boxer (part of the EMAN 2.1 software suite)68from 80 micrographs. Boxed out particle projections were subjected to 2D reference-free alignment and classification using ISAC69. The particles from ISAC 2D classification were further cleaned using RELION62and resulted in 29 good class averages with 15,056 particle projections.

Extended data figures and tablesExtended Data Fig. 1 Modulation of GRK1 activity by anionic lipids, Rho* C-terminal modifications, and Fab fragments.
a, Kinetic analysis of GRK1 phosphorylation of Rho* in ROS or LMNG or LMNG + c8-PtdIns(4,5)P2. Mean ± s.d.,n= 4 technical replicates. Reactions were performed in 50 mM HEPES (pH 8.0), 10 mM MgCl2for 2 min at room temperature.
b, Kinetic analysis of GRK1 phosphorylation of Rho* in ROS or POPC nanodiscs containing 40% POPG or 40% POPS or 10% PtdIns(4,5)P2. Mean ± s.d.,n= 3 technical replicates. Reactions were performed in 50 mM HEPES (pH 8.0), 10 mM MgCl2for 2 min at room temperature.
c, Representative Michaelis–Menten kinetics measurement with varying ATP. Rho* was reconstituted with POPC nanodiscs containing 40% POPG (black squares) or 40% POPS (black triangles) and compared with Rho* in ROS (black circles). GRK1(5A) activity was greatly diminished relative to GRK1 under these conditions (blue symbols) but was still somewhat responsive to anionic lipids.
d, Approximate location of the five positively charged residues places them close to the lipid bilayer.
e, The crosslinking yield (corresponding to the amount of complex formed divided by the sum of the input GRK1 and Rho*) of GRK1(5A) was significantly lower than that of GRK1 in the presence of c8-PtdIns(4,5)P2but not in its absence. The crosslinking level of GRK1(5A) was compared with that of GRK1 using a two-sidedt-test (n= 3 technical replicates) in the presence or absence of c8-PtdIns(4,5)P2. For gel source data, see Supplementary Fig.
5f.
f, The crosslinking yield of p-Rho* (with estimated 6–8 phosphates out of 7 incorporated based on a standard curve) with GRK1 was compared with that of unphosphorylated rhodopsin using two-sidedt-test (n= 4 technical replicates). For gel source data, see Supplementary Fig.
5h.
g, The crosslinking yield of Asp-N-truncated Rho* (cleavage site N-terminal to Asp329) was compared with that of full-length Rho* using two-sidedt-test (n= 5 technical replicates; N.S., not significant). For gel source data, see Supplementary Fig.
5i. The GRK1(K479R) mutant, which eliminates the other prominent crosslinking site, also did not affect our ability to trap the complex (data not shown). Mean ± s.d.
h, ELISA analysis of Fab1 and Fab6 binding to GRK1 yielded EC50values of 2 and 5 nM, respectively (n= 3 technical replicates). Mean ± s.d.
i, Michaelis–Menten analysis of GRK1 in the absence or presence of threefold molar excess Fab1 or Fab6 (n= 3 technical replicates). Data were normalized to the fitVmax, Rhoof GRK1. Mean ± s.d.
Extended Data Fig. 2 Workflow of cryo-EM data processing and resolution analysis of Rho*−GRK1.
a, Representative raw cryo-EM micrograph from a total of 2,542. From these, 2.7 million particles were automatically picked in RELION-3 and were used to generate 2D class averages (shown are representative good classes). After screening out bad classes, 705,966 particles remained. Three major classes from 3D classification were generated in RELION-3 using an initial model generated by cryoSPARC. Class 2 (183,717 particles) showed the best quality and was selected for 3D auto-refinement, resulting in a final map at a global resolution of 7.0 Å (FSC cut-off = 0.143).
b, Directional FSC indicated that the resolutions in thexandzdirections are similar to the global resolution, whereas the resolution in theydirection is lower because fewer particles have this axis resolved.
c, Plots of the global FSC together with the spread of directional resolution values defined by ±1σfrom the mean and a histogram of 100 such values evenly sampled over the 3D FSC.

Extended Data Fig. 3 Workflow of cryo-EM data processing and resolution analysis of Rho*−GRK1(S5E/EE).
a, Representative raw cryo-EM micrograph from a total of 2,130. From these, 2.7 million particles were automatically picked in cryoSPARC and were used to generate 2D class averages (shown are representative good classes). After screening out bad classes, the 584,674 remaining particles were imported to RELION-3 and used to generate six major classes from 3D classification in RELION-3 using an initial model generated by cryoSPARC. Class 6 (132,721 particles) showed the best quality and was selected for 3D auto-refinement, resulting in a final map at a global resolution of 5.8 Å (FSC cut-off = 0.143).

a, Representative raw cryo-EM micrograph from a total of 5,501. From these, 5.7 million particles were automatically picked in cryoSPARC and were used to generate 2D class averages (shown are representative good classes). After screening out bad classes, the 421,682 remaining particles were further processed using heterogeneous refinement. Classes 2 and 3 showed similar quality and were selected for homogeneous refinement and then non-uniform refinement in cryoSPARC, resulting in a final map at a global resolution of 4.1 Å (FSC cut-off = 0.143).

a, A representative raw cryo-EM micrograph from a total of 8,358. From these, 7.5 million particles were automatically picked in cryoSPARC and were used to generate 2D class averages (shown are representative good classes). After screening out bad classes, the 352,864 remaining particles were further processed using heterogeneous refinement. Classes 2 and 3 showed similar quality and were selected for homogeneous refinement and then non-uniform refinement in cryoSPARC. The resolution of the final map is estimated to be 4.0 Å. Global resolution was determined by FSC with a cut-off of 0.143.

e, Overlay of Rho* from the Fab1 (red) and Fab6 (blue) complexes after alignment of the small lobes of their kinase domains. Rho* pivots by about 5.5°, largely around an axis roughly parallel to a vector joining the ICL1 and ICL3 loops of the receptor. The key interactions between Rho* and GRK1, namely that of TM3, TM5 and TM6 with αN, and ICL1 with the C-terminal end of the AST, stay intact. This is because the αN helix and the N-terminal half of the AST loop region of GRK1 shift with the receptor, which is reasonable given that these elements are known to be dynamic from crystal structures of GRKs. Motion of these elements is likely to be responsible for the observed difference in kinase domain conformation exhibited by the Fab1 and Fab6 complexes because they directly affect the hinge region of the kinase domain. There are, however, small conformational differences at the end of TM1 and the beginning of the ICL1 loop in Rho* that probably occur because the bound GPCR is trying to maintain optimal interactions with phosphosites at the end of the AST in each state. The conformation of ICL2 is also likely to change between the structures, but this region could not be accurately modelled. Because our PC analysis (Fig.
2e) suggests that the Fab6 complex features a less active conformation of the GRK1 kinase domain, it may represent an intermediate state in which αN and AST have engaged the receptor, but the kinase domain has yet to fully adopt a transition state-like conformation.
Extended Data Fig. 6 Assessment of ligand density, of the presence of all-transretinal, and of the conformational heterogeneity of the GRK1 RH domain.
a, Electron density of all-transretinal, contoured at 17σ(Fab1 map) and 13σ(Fab6 map); Sgv, contoured at 24σ(Fab1 map) and 26σ(Fab6 map); and αN, contoured at 21σ(Fab1 map) and 25σ(Fab6 map).
b, Light- and GRK ligand-dependence of the crosslinking reaction between rhodopsin and GRK1. 11-cisretinal undergoes isomerization upon light exposure to all-transretinal, which serves as a full agonist for rhodopsin. The crosslinking level of GRK1 with rhodopsin in the dark (n= 4 technical replicates) and in the light with excess 11-cisretinal (n= 3 technical replicates) were compared to that of GRK1 with rhodopsin in the light using one-way ANOVA followed by a Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test. Mean ± s.d.
c, Density for the RH domain was not observed by cryo-EM in any of our reconstructions. The map of Rho*−GRK1(S5E/EE)−Fab1 is shown here as an example.
d, A representative negative-stain EM micrograph of the Rho*−GRK1 complex solubilized in LMNG (left) along with representative 2D averages (right), indicating heterogeneity in the bound GRK1. The smaller, variably positioned domain is interpreted as the RH domain.
Extended Data Fig. 7 GRK αN interactions, kinase domain conformational changes, and comparison of the interactions between Rho* and its three principal downstream targets.
a–d, The GRK N terminus folds into a helix (αN) that packs against the small lobe and AST of the kinase domain, forming a docking side for Rho* (a,b; GRK1 with Fab1 and Fab6 complexes, respectively), Ca2+·CaM (c; GRK5 in PDB entry 6PJX27), or a twofold related crystal lattice contact (d; GRK6 in PDB entry 3NYN6). The interfaces shown are mediated by the same highly conserved hydrophobic residues (side chains shown with spheres).
e, The cytoplasmic cleft and ICL1 of activated β2AR in its G-protein-bound conformation (PDB entry 3SN671) readily accommodates αN and AST of GRK1.
f–h, Kinase domain small lobes from different ‘active’ GRK structures were aligned to highlight differences in closure.
i–l, Comparison of downstream proteins bound to the cytoplasmic surface of Rho*. The side chains of residues interacting with GRK1 in the Fab1 complex (i; PDB entry 7MTA), GRK1 in the Fab6 complex (j; PDB entry 7MTB), Gαt(transducin) (k; PDB entry 6OYA14) and arrestin-1 (l; PDB entry 5W0P31) are shown as yellow spheres. Note that αN of GRK1 and α5 of Gα bind with opposite polarity.
m,n, Cartoon representations of GRK1 αN helix docked to Rho* in the Fab1 (m) and Fab6 (n) models.
o, GαtC terminus bound to Rho* (PDB entry 6OYA14).
p, Arrestin-1 finger loop bound to Rho* (PDB entry 5W0P31).
Extended Data Fig. 8 Interactions of GRK1 with intracellular loops of Rho* and development of autophosphorylation mimetic variants.
a, Interactions of GRK1 αN with the cytoplasmic cleft and H8 of Rho*. GRK1-Ser5 was modelled in a phosphorylated state to demonstrate proximity to Rho*-Lys311 and Arg314.
b, GRK1 AST interaction with ICL1. The key participating residues are shown with stick side chains. Ser488 and Thr489 are autophosphorylation sites in GRK1.
c–g, Kinetic and crosslinking analysis of GRK1 and phosphomimetic mutants of Rho* autophosphorylation (S5E; S488E and T489E (EE); S488D and T489D (DD); S5E, S488E, and T489E (S5E/EE)). One-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s multiple comparison test was carried out to compare each mutant with GRK1. Reactions were performed in 50 mM HEPES (pH 8.0), 10 mM MgCl2for 2 min at room temperature. Data were normalized to theVmax,RhoorVmax,ATPof GRK1. For Rho kinetics: S5E,n= 4; EE,n= 5; DD,n= 3; S5E/EE,n= 3. For ATP kinetics: S5E,n= 3; EE,n= 3; DD,n= 4; S5E/EE,n= 4 (all technical replicates). All data shown as mean ± s.d.
f, Time courses of tubulin phosphorylation by GRK1 and variants are similar. Data were normalized to the phosphorylation level of tubulin by GRK1 at 30 min (n= 3 technical replicates).

Extended Data Fig. 9 MC4 crosslinker properties and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry peptide coverage of the Rho*−GRK1 complex.
a, MC4 has two symmetrical amine-reactive NHS esters separated by a C4 linker attached to a quaternaryN-morpholine group. *Conformational analyses of in vacuo MD simulations suggest an average carboxy C–C distance of approximately 6 Å.
b, Characterization of MC4 reactive distance using BSA. They-axis shows the frequency (expressed as %) of experimentally identified crosslinked lysine pairs within a certain Cα–Cα distance (x-axis) based on a BSA crystal structure (PDB entry 4F5S72).
c, Peptide sequence coverage obtained for the purified crosslinked Rho*−GRK1 complex after multistep digestion withStaphylococcus aureusProtease V8 (GluC)/mix (1:1 mixture of GluC/trypsin and GluC/chymotrypsin) or GluC/trypsin.
d, Intramolecular and intermolecular crosslinks summarized from Supplementary Data Tables2,3are shown with a bar plot generated by XiNET73. Dashed green lines represent rare intermolecular crosslinks that were too distant to react in our cryo-EM models.
