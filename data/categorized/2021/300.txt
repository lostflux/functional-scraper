The Snapchat maker revamped its developer platform policies on March 17, 2022, to ban anonymous apps and require developers to build friend-finding apps to limit access to users 18 or older. The policy changes were effective immediately and existing developers were given 30 days to come into compliance \u2014 a date that would have passed last month.<\/p>\nIt is now mid-May and some developers of the newly banned and restricted apps are not yet meeting Snap\u2019s new requirements.<\/p>\nSnap confirmed to TechCrunch a small number of apps were given extensions, including anonymous apps LMK and Send It. But others seemed to be working around Snap’s ban with their friend-finding apps marketed to users ages 12+, instead of the now required 18+. They got away with this by not actually using the SDK — something impossible to tell from their App Store marketing and screenshots which imply they’re directly integrated with Snap’s features. Another app had flown under the radar, continuing to operate in violation of the rules unless TechCrunch pointed it out, resulting in a belated ban. This lack of clarity on which apps are platform apps, and which are only pretending to be, could complicate things for Snap, which is engaged in litigation over bullying-related suicides. And like all social media, the company could be under new U.S. regulation related to child safety matters in the future, as well.<\/p>\n"embed breakout\">\n"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"Bd2UjCgxsR\">"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/05\/17\/snapchats-stricter-policies-for-anonymous-apps-and-friend-finders-arent-yet-fully-enforced\/\">Snapchat’s stricter policies for anonymous apps and friend finders aren’t yet fully enforced<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"“Snapchat’s stricter policies for anonymous apps and friend finders aren’t yet fully enforced” — TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/05\/17\/snapchats-stricter-policies-for-anonymous-apps-and-friend-finders-arent-yet-fully-enforced\/embed\/#?secret=e39VRJvFjG#?secret=Bd2UjCgxsR\" data-secret=\"Bd2UjCgxsR\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\nTwitter deal still a go… for now<\/h3>\nFirst,"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/05\/13\/elon-musk-twitter-deal-on-hold-spam\/\">Elon Musk tweeted<\/a> that the Twitter deal was “temporarily on hold” until Twitter could prove the percentage of spambots on its platform was actually less than 5%, as it reports.

Now, instead of asking users to agree to any subscription price increases, developers will be able to roll out a price increase with the user\u2019s explicit consent. The feature allows developers to simply inform customers they\u2019ll be charged more, but not require the customer to opt-in to the higher pricing.<\/p>\n"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/04\/05\/apple-pilot-tests-feature-that-allows-developers-to-automatically-charge-users-for-subscription-price-increases\/\">We first broke the news that Apple was pilot testing this program<\/a> last month, when it appeared Disney+ subscription customers had simply been told their price was increasing but weren\u2019t asked for their consent. Apple then confirmed this was the result of a \u201cnew commerce feature\u201d it planned to launch soon, which it said would be \u201cgreat for both developers and users.\u201d<\/p>\nApple\u2019s position is that this could save customers the hassle of having their subscriptions automatically canceled just because they didn\u2019t see the notification or email that asked them to opt in to the price increase.<\/p>\n\u201cThis has led to some services being unintentionally interrupted for users and they must take steps to resubscribe within the app, from Settings on iPhone and iPad, or in the App Store on Mac,\u201d the company explained in its announcement on Monday.<\/p>\nHowever, the flip side of this argument is that those same customers who would have missed the consent notification will likely be the same ones who would now miss the notification informing them their subscription will be increasing in price. There\u2019s also an argument here that this change could enable unscrupulous developers and scammers to better profit from their victims if Apple doesn’t carefully enforce the program rules.<\/p>\nCurrently, those state that developers can\u2019t increase prices more than once per year. The increase also can\u2019t exceed 50% of the subscription price, and the difference in price can\u2019t exceed $5 USD per period for non-annual subscriptions or $50 USD for annual subscriptions.<\/p>\nWeekly News<\/h1>\nPlatforms: Apple<\/h3>\n\nApple"https:\/\/9to5mac.com\/2022\/05\/19\/ios-15-6-beta-1-available-public-beta-testers\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">released<\/a> the first public betas of iOS 15.6,<\/strong>\u00a0iPadOS 15.6, tvOS 15.6,"https:\/\/www.imore.com\/how-download-watchos-8-public-beta\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">watchOS 8.7<\/a> and macOS 12.5.

This allows brands to tap into the power of the creator\u2019s platform and reach their fanbase, but then gives the brands themselves access to that audience \u2014 and the key metrics and analytics associated with their live event \u2014 directly on their own YouTube channel.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nFintech<\/h3>\n\nFTX US"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/05\/19\/crypto-exchange-ftx-expands-into-stock-trading-retail-investors\/\">plans to launch<\/a> FTX Stocks, a zero-commission stock trading feature available through the FTX mobile app,<\/strong> rolling out in the U.S. in the “coming months.” The news is particularly notable given that billionaire FTX US founder Sam Bankman-Fried recently acquired a 7.6% stake in Robinhood.<\/li>\nRobinhood will launch a standalone app that"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2022\/05\/17\/robinhood-to-let-users-hold-their-own-crypto-and-nfts-as-start-up-reaches-for-growth-beyond-stock-trading.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">lets users hold their own cryptocurrencies and NFTs<\/a>,<\/strong> putting it in direct competition with Coinbase and startups like MetaMask or Rainbow.

They join for the opportunity to have an impact and to grow. And so in a lot of cases, it may be a more opportune time to take a chance in an early-stage company because you can focus on that long-term horizon, and you can get that opportunity to grow and have an impact,\u201d Hoffman told me.<\/p>\nFor employees, he said there will still be opportunities at good companies in any economic conditions, but attracting talent always comes down to creating a good place to work.<\/p>\n“Even in the tightest of economic environments \u2014 and we\u2019re not there yet \u2014 there\u2019s always going to be high demand for the best talent. Always. So the things that you need to do to attract, engage and retain these employees does not change,” he said.

nascent teams, given the firm has been among the earliest backers in a notable number of companies that have gone to raise ever-bigger rounds and higher valuations, including the now publicly traded companies DoorDash and Guardant Health.<\/p>\nOther startups to attract capital from Pear before nearly any other firm was aware of their existence include the deep-linking startup Branch, which

likely to see the valuations of its still-private portfolio companies slide downward — possibly by a lot — depending on how long this correction lasts.<\/p>\nHershenson, who joined TechCrunch for a mobility-focused event this week, noted on stage that startups are in for a bumpy ride, given how frothy the market had grown.<\/p>"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\nAsked if the"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/for-tech-startups-the-party-is-over-11652710330?mod=tech_lead_pos5\">startup party is over<\/a>, Hershenson answered: “Maybe for a little while it’s over . . .The problem is that the market was priced too high in 2021, and we’re all adjusting to that price change, and that changes how companies raise money.<\/p>\n“Everybody knows that the stock market is down a lot,” she’d said. “Software stocks are down in some cases 80%. [Meanwhile] if you’re a private company, and you were very lucky and you raised money in 2021, you may have gotten a multiple of 100x on your ARR. Today, those multiples are 10x or 20x. That means that if your company was $2 billion [at the time of your fundraise], your company is [now] worth $200 million.:<\/p>\nEven with a steep reset in prices, however, Pear’s success to date is undeniable. It’s also unlikely.<\/p>\nNozad, very famously, was earlier a rug dealer who insisted on toting rugs to his clients’ homes, where during the course of long conversations, they would learn about the rug and he would learn about their business. He eventually became a scout for his boss, and a trusted friend to some very powerful people.<\/p>\n\u201cHe has a good sniffer, and I trust the guy,\u201d\u00a0 Sequoia\u2019s Doug Leone"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/victoriabarret\/2012\/03\/21\/silicon-valleys-hottest-vc-is-a-rug-dealer\/?sh=3dfe6dbb31d5\">told Forbes<\/a> back in 2012. \u201cHe\u2019s like me, from the earth.\u201d Sequoia has, in fact, backed a number of companies that Pear has funded, including Guardant Health and DoorDash.<\/p>\nMeanwhile, his partner, Mar Hershenson, was also very much an outlier when the two struck out on their own. Despite founding several companies previously — one of which Nozad backed — and though she holds an M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Stanford University, she is a native of Spain and even more unusual in VC circles a decade ago, she is a woman who had not previously cut her teeth at someone else’s venture firm.<\/p>\nThat may not seem very notable today but in 2012, it put Hershenson in rare company.<\/p>\nAs for the team’s newest bets, Pear hosted an invite-only demo day earlier this week, coverage of which we’ll have for readers soon. (Unlike Y Combinator, the outfit holds a demo day each year for a comparatively limited number of companies — typically around 10.)<\/p>\nIn the meantime, some of its other recent checks have gone to Sudozi, a two-year-old Austin, Tex., startup that provides a SaaS platform to help enterprises improve their money management capabilities and that just this month announced a"https:\/\/venturebeat.com\/2022\/05\/12\/sudozi-nabs-4-3m-to-simplify-money-management-for-enterprises\/\">$4.3 million<\/a> seed round led by Pear.<\/p>\nPear also recently wrote a follow-on check to Osmind, a two-year-old, Bay Area-based startup that makes software to chart and update patient information and documents, with a focus on mental health.

components and code go into your everyday devices and appliances is a critical part of the software development process that billions of people rely on every day.<\/p>\nSoftware is just like any other product you build and ship; it relies on using components that others have built, often in the form of source code, and making sure that it doesn’t break or have weaknesses that compromise the final product. Most of the world’s software relies on open source code that’s written by developers who publish their work for anyone to use. That also means a reliance on trusting that the developers will always act in good faith. But projects get abandoned and picked up by others who plant backdoors or malware, or, as seen recently since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, a rise in “protestware,” in which open source software developers"https:\/\/www.technologyreview.com\/2022\/03\/21\/1047489\/activists-are-targeting-russians-with-open-source-protestware\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">alter their code<\/a> to wipe the contents of Russian computers in protest of the Kremlin’s incursion.<\/p>\nFeross Aboukhadijeh, a prolific open source maintainer and the founder of"https:\/\/socket.dev\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Socket<\/a>, told TechCrunch in a recent call that development teams often put too much trust in open source code, which can be catastrophic if a deliberate vulnerability is introduced into the supply chain and goes unnoticed.<\/p>\nSoftware is generally easier to fix than"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/08\/pony-ai-to-issue-recall-of-autonomous-driving-software\/\">autonomous cars<\/a> and"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/02\/fitbit-ionic-smartwatches-recalled-following-battery-burn-reports\/\">other hardware<\/a> that have to be recalled. But the consequences of a software compromise can be dire and widespread. Tainted software updates have led to"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/17\/fireeye-breach-solarwinds-federal-agencies\/\">the mass compromise of U.S. federal government networks<\/a>,"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/07\/05\/kaseya-hack-flood-ransomware\/\">ransomware attacks<\/a> and the targeting of enterprise password managers"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/08\/04\/passwordstate-supply-chain-attack\/\">aimed at stealing sensitive corporate secrets<\/a>.<\/p>\nAboukhadijeh"https:\/\/twitter.com\/feross\/status\/1498676284590800903\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">founded<\/a> Socket earlier this year alongside a team of fellow open source maintainers who have seen firsthand some of the worst software supply chain attacks in the wild. And so the team began work on building an app that developers can use to detect and block introducing potentially malicious code into their projects from millions of open source code repositories.<\/p>\nThe app plugs in to a GitHub developer’s account and runs through dozens of known behaviors, looking for package issues like potentially suspicious changes to the code, such as if an open source package you depend on suddenly starts trying to communicate over the network or getting shell access, which might indicate that the package has been compromised.<\/p>\nAboukhadijeh described Socket as offering a nutrition-fact label of an open source package’s capabilities by illuminating what access, permissions and behaviors a package has, like install scripts, which many kinds of malware use to hook into a victim’s system.<\/p>\n“We can’t tell you with certainty whether a package is talking to the network is a bad sign or not, because what if it’s a web server \u2014 then it’s obviously going to need to do that!” said Aboukhadijeh. But having that visibility integrated into the software building process is what developers need to prevent a supply chain attack. “This isn’t some complicated AI or machine learning thing,” he said, speaking of his own product. “There’s no way to hide that a package runs an install script, it’s declared as part of the package. So why not raise that to a developer’s attention?”<\/p>\nSocket is still in its early days and enters a crowded market, but is already attracting investment. The early-stage startup has raised $4.6 million in seed round funding from over a dozen angel investors and security leaders, including ex-GitHub CEO Nat Friedman, Keybase co-founder Max Krohn, as well as Unusual Ventures, Village Global and South Park Commons.<\/p>\nAboukhadijeh told TechCrunch that the funding will help grow the startup’s engineering, security analysis and research teams to build out its tools to developers.<\/p>\nRead more:<\/b><\/p>\n\n"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/17\/fireeye-breach-solarwinds-federal-agencies\/\">Just how bad is that hack that hit US government agencies?<\/a><\/li>\n"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/02\/11\/why-are-internet-asset-startups-so-hot-right-now\/\">Why are cybersecurity asset management startups so hot right now?<\/a><\/li>\n"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/07\/05\/kaseya-hack-flood-ransomware\/\">Kaseya hack floods hundreds of companies with ransomware<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Securing the software supply chain is admittedly somewhat of a dry topic, but knowing which components and code go into your everyday devices and appliances is a critical part of the software development process that billions of people rely on every day.

information.<\/p>\nThe Austin, Texas-based startup, which previously went by RigUp, was founded in 2014 as a marketplace for on-demand and skilled labor in the oil and gas industry. The company changed its name to Workrise in February 2021 to accommodate a broader set of energy sectors, like solar, construction and defense. By May 2021, Workrise said it had"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/20\/workrise-once-known-as-rigup-raises-300m-at-a-2-9b-valuation\/\">raised $300 million at a $2.9 billion valuation<\/a>. But last month,"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/04\/05\/workrise-cuts-staff-verticals-after-being-valued-at-2-9b-last-year\/\">Workrise announced layoffs<\/a> that reportedly hit hundreds of the company’s 600 employees after the midpandemic pivot failed to pan out.<\/p>\nNow, a security researcher who goes by the handle"https:\/\/twitter.com\/0xRzlr\">Rzlr<\/a> told TechCrunch that they found an exposed Workrise API that allowed anyone to retrieve personal information about subcontractors directly from Workrise servers without needing a password.<\/p>\nThe API was able to return names, email addresses and some employment details about subcontractor’s work, and names and email addresses about the people who provided references for the subcontractors, such as their former colleagues and managers.<\/p>\nIn simple terms, an API allows two things to talk with each other over the internet, like a smartphone app, a"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/05\/peloton-bug-account-data-leak\/\">Peloton bike<\/a>\u00a0or"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/03\/cbord-university-digital-locks\/\">door locks<\/a> that need to communicate with their servers. In this case the unauthenticated API could be queried using a web browser by plugging in a unique four-digit user ID that corresponds with a subcontractor’s review. But the user IDs were sequential, allowing anyone to access another subcontractor’s information simply by changing the user ID by a single digit, a common security flaw known as an insecure direct object reference bug \u2014 though Rzlr said not every digit returned a valid response.<\/p>\nSeveral of the exposed records seen by TechCrunch were created as far back as 2019 and marked as “draft.”<\/p>\nRzlr said in their limited testing of 1,000 records, they found more than 920 records with names and email addresses. Rzlr said the API did not limit the amount of data that could be downloaded, which they warned could have presented a scraping risk.<\/p>\nA screenshot shared with TechCrunch showed that the data could be easily scraped.<\/p>\nTechCrunch emailed CEO Xuan Yong and COO Mike Witte, who did not respond, but a short time later the API was no longer publicly accessible and was protected by a login page. In an emailed response, Eric Murphy, Workrise’s vice president of security, told TechCrunch: “Users maintain public profiles by default,” said Murphy. “To the extent Workrise determines any active user data was exposed that was not intended to be public, Workrise plans to notify those users directly.”<\/p>\nRzlr said they contacted several Workrise email addresses on April 22 \u2014 including Murphy’s and the company’s main security email address \u2014 about the exposed API. When asked why the API was not secured for two weeks until TechCrunch contacted the company, Murphy said the researcher’s emails were marked as spam.<\/p>\nWorkrise also fixed a second API issue that allowed anyone to obtain users’ referral codes, which could then be used to query the API to obtain the name, email address, phone number and the referral payment amount of users who invited others to join the site.<\/p>\nWhen asked if the company had carried out security audits of its systems, Murphy said the company had undergone “multiple” third-party audits but declined to name the company that allegedly performed them.<\/p>\n"embed breakout\">\n"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"SbRyeSFpKA\">"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/04\/05\/workrise-cuts-staff-verticals-after-being-valued-at-2-9b-last-year\/\">Workrise cuts staff, verticals after being valued at $2.9B last year<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"“Workrise cuts staff, verticals after being valued at $2.9B last year” — TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/04\/05\/workrise-cuts-staff-verticals-after-being-valued-at-2-9b-last-year\/embed\/#?secret=B0RcBW4W6X#?secret=SbRyeSFpKA\" data-secret=\"SbRyeSFpKA\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Workforce management unicorn Workrise has fixed an exposed API that was spilling some users’ personal information.

breach on March 7 during which an unauthorized individual accessed the company’s protected health data. The data breach notice warned that patients’ demographic, health, and financial information was accessed, including names, phone numbers, dates of birth, but also medical histories, diagnoses, treatments, lab test results, prescriptions, and health insurance information.<\/p>\nmyNurse said in the data breach notice that its decision to shutter its business “is unrelated to the data security incident,” but did not provide a reason for the unexpected shutdown. The company said it began notifying affected patients on April 29, the same date as its data breach notification, more than seven weeks after the breach was discovered.<\/p>\nmyNurse co-founder and chief executive Waleed Mohsen provided TechCrunch with a short statement saying the company was considering “how best to adjust our business model amid a changing healthcare landscape,” but declined to answer any of our questions about the data breach, including why it took the company seven weeks to notify affected patients or if myNurse had carried out a third-party security audit of its systems prior to the breach.<\/p>\nMohsen also declined to say how many patients are affected in total. Under the law of California, where myNurse is headquartered, companies must notify the attorney general’s office if more than 500 people are affected.<\/p>\nRead more:<\/b><\/p>\n\n"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/03\/17\/medical-health-data-leak\/\">A huge trove of medical records and prescriptions found exposed<\/a><\/li>\n"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/01\/ntreatment-lab-results-medical-records-exposed\/\">Thousands of US lab results and medical records spilled online after a security lapse<\/a><\/li>\n"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/07\/01\/one-medical-exposed-customers-email-addresses\/\">An email sent by One Medical exposed hundreds of customers\u2019 email addresses<\/a><\/li>\n"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/01\/28\/labcorp-website-bug-medical-data-exposed\/\">LabCorp security lapse exposed thousands of medical documents<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"myNurse, a healthcare startup that provides chronic care management and remote patient monitoring services, said it will shut down at the end of the month after reporting a data breach that exposed personal health information of its users.

Google explains what kinds of personal information it will remove, such as confidential government ID identification numbers, bank account numbers, images of ID documents, as well as contact information, like phone numbers and email addresses.<\/p>\nWhen you’re ready, head to"https:\/\/support.google.com\/websearch\/troubleshooter\/9685456\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google’s search results removal form<\/a> and hitRemove information you see in Google Search<\/b>, thenIn<\/strong>Google’s search results and on a website<\/b>. At this point, Google will give you guidance if you want to reach out to the website host, but otherwise you can sayNo, I prefer not to<\/b> contact the website host and just move on with the form.<\/p>\nAt this point Google should ask you which search results you want removed. You should selectPersonal info, like ID numbers and private documents<\/b>, then select the kind of personal information that you want removed, such as your contact information, private medical documents or other government identity documents. From here, you should fill out the form with your corresponding information, including your full name, country of residence, your best contact email address and the list of web addresses of your personal information. You can grab the web addresses of infringing search results from your browser’s address bar.<\/p>\nThe final question on this form is if your personal information pertains to doxxing, which Google asks if the information is “being shared with malicious, threatening, or harassing intent.” If this is the case, selectYes<\/b>.<\/p>\nYou will have to provide all of the web addresses where you have found your information. That can mean both the web address of the webpage that has your information\u2014 and<\/i> the web addresses of the Google search results page. You may also have to"https:\/\/support.google.com\/adwords\/answer\/100070\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">take and submit screenshots<\/a> of search results to help Google narrow down the request to you. You can submit up to 1,000 web addresses at a time.<\/p>\nOnce you’re done, check the signature form at the bottom of the form.<\/p>\nRemember, removing your information from Google’s search results is not a panacea. Google’s request feature will not automatically remove your personal information from the websites your data is hosted on, but it makes it more difficult for others to discover the data without the aid of Google’s search algorithm.<\/p>\nFilling out the search removal form is also not a guarantee that Google will take action on your behalf. Google"https:\/\/blog.google\/products\/search\/new-options-for-removing-your-personally-identifiable-information-from-search\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">said<\/a> it will “evaluate all

Microsoft did not say which internet provider but warned that the activity was detected as recently as this month. The Ukrainian government said last month"https:\/\/twitter.com\/dsszzi\/status\/1508528209075257347\">it had “neutralized”<\/a> a cyberattack targeting the IT infrastructure of Ukrtelecom, the country’s largest internet provider.<\/p>\nTom Burt, Microsoft’s consumer security chief, said the company has observed close to 40 destructive attacks directly targeting critical infrastructure, with about 40% of those attacks “aimed at organizations in critical infrastructure sectors that could have negative second-order effects on the Ukrainian government, military, economy and people.”<\/p>\nNot all of the attacks were successful. In one case, Microsoft said it found evidence that Sandworm was setting the stage for a file-encrypting attack on an agriculture firm, likely to disrupt its grain production supply, for which Ukraine is a major global exporter.<\/p>\nSandworm and Fancy Bear are two of six separate Russian state-run hacking groups targeting Ukraine in more than 237 operations since just before the invasion, Burt said.<\/p>\n“The attacks have not only degraded the systems of institutions in Ukraine but have also sought to disrupt people\u2019s access to reliable information and critical life services, and have attempted to shake confidence in the country\u2019s leadership,” said Burt. “We have also observed limited espionage attack activity involving other NATO member states, and some disinformation activity.”<\/p>\n"embed breakout\">\n"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"7OKDdaPzdP\">"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/02\/02\/ukraine-russia-us-cybersecurity\/\">How the conflict in Ukraine threatens US cybersecurity<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"“How the conflict in Ukraine threatens US cybersecurity” — TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/02\/02\/ukraine-russia-us-cybersecurity\/embed\/#?secret=LsqWCl14P5#?secret=7OKDdaPzdP\" data-secret=\"7OKDdaPzdP\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"The U.S. government has stepped up its hunt for six Russian intelligence officers, best known as the state-backed hacking group dubbed “Sandworm,” by offering a $10 million bounty for information that identifies or locates its members.

legal, according to a U.S. appeals court ruling.<\/p>\nThe landmark ruling by the U.S. Ninth Circuit of Appeals is the latest in a long-running legal battle brought by LinkedIn aimed at stopping a rival company from web scraping personal information from users’ public profiles. The case"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/14\/supreme-court-revives-linkedin-bid-to-protect-user-data-from-web-scrapers\/\">reached the U.S. Supreme Court<\/a> last year but was sent back to the Ninth Circuit for the original appeals court to re-review the case.<\/p>\nIn its second ruling on Monday, the Ninth Circuit reaffirmed its original decision and found that scraping data that is publicly accessible on the internet is not a violation of"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/11\/29\/supreme-court-van-buren-hacking\/\">the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act<\/a>, or CFAA, which governs what constitutes computer hacking under U.S. law.<\/p>\nThe Ninth Circuit’s decision is a major win for archivists, academics, researchers and journalists who use tools to mass collect, or scrape, information that is publicly accessible on the internet. Without a ruling in place, long-running projects to archive websites no longer online and using publicly accessible data for academic and research studies have been left in legal limbo.<\/p>\nBut there have been egregious cases of web scraping that have sparked privacy and security concerns. Facial recognition startup Clearview AI claims to have scraped billions of social media profile photos, prompting"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/21\/data-brokers-bill-wyden-paul-privacy-clearview\/\">several tech giants to file lawsuits<\/a> against the startup. Several companies, including"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/09\/04\/facebook-phone-numbers-exposed\/\">Facebook<\/a>, Instagram,"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/11\/scraped-parler-data-is-a-metadata-goldmine\/\">Parler<\/a>,"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/06\/16\/millions-venmo-transactions-scraped\/\">Venmo<\/a>\u00a0and Clubhouse have all had users’ data scraped over the years.<\/p>\nThe case before the Ninth Circuit was originally brought by LinkedIn against Hiq Labs, a company that uses public data to analyze employee attrition. LinkedIn said Hiq’s mass web scraping of LinkedIn user profiles was against its terms of service, amounted to hacking and was therefore a violation of the CFAA. LinkedIn first lost"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/08\/15\/linkedin-sues-scrapers\/\">the case against Hiq<\/a> in 2019 after the Ninth Circuit found that the CFAA does not bar anyone from scraping data that’s publicly accessible.<\/p>\nOn its second pass of the case, the Ninth Circuit said it relied on"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/03\/supreme-court-hacking-cfaa-ruling\/\">a Supreme Court decision<\/a> last June, during which the U.S. top court took its first look at the decades-old CFAA. In its ruling, the Supreme Court narrowed what constitutes a violation of the CFAA as those who gain unauthorized access to a computer system \u2014 rather than a broader interpretation of exceeding existing authorization, which the court argued could have attached criminal penalties to “a breathtaking amount of commonplace computer activity.” Using a “gate-up, gate-down” analogy, the Supreme Court said that when a computer or website’s gates are up \u2014 and therefore information is publicly accessible \u2014 no authorization is required.<\/p>\nThe Ninth Circuit, in referencing the Supreme Court’s “gate-up, gate-down” analogy, ruled that “the concept of ‘without authorization’ does not apply to public websites.”<\/p>\n“We\u2019re disappointed in the court\u2019s decision. This is a preliminary ruling and the case is far from over,” said LinkedIn spokesperson Greg Snapper in a statement. “We will continue to fight to protect our members\u2019 ability to control the information they make available on LinkedIn. When your data is taken without permission and used in ways you haven\u2019t agreed to, that\u2019s not okay. On LinkedIn, our members trust us with their information, which is why we prohibit unauthorized scraping on our platform.”<\/p>\n"embed breakout\">\n"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"UiGWNhmGsA\">"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/03\/supreme-court-hacking-cfaa-ruling\/\">Supreme Court limits US hacking law in landmark CFAA ruling<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"“Supreme Court limits US hacking law in landmark CFAA ruling” — TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/03\/supreme-court-hacking-cfaa-ruling\/embed\/#?secret=Kgp97JGgVy#?secret=UiGWNhmGsA\" data-secret=\"UiGWNhmGsA\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Good news for archivists, academics, researchers and journalists: Scraping publicly accessible data is legal, according to a U.S. appeals court ruling.

Ovalbek Turdakun was a prisoner in one of China’s notorious detention camps, where he was tortured, subject to horrific conditions and under constant surveillance.<\/p>\nIn a makeshift courtroom inside the detention camp he was being held, Turdakun was not permitted to speak and was made to sign papers he was given no time to read. As a former law student, he knew that the court was not following a proper legal process, but was nevertheless told that the court’s decision would lead to “great things” for him and that he would study and live for free.<\/p>\nTurdakun is a Chinese passport holder and an ethnic Kyrgyz, one of several ethnic groups \u2014 including Kazakhs, Tajiks and Uyghurs \u2014 that have been charged with dubious if not invented charges and detained in vast detention camps across Xinjiang, a region in northwestern China where most of the ethnic groups live. Beijing calls them vocational and education centers and says they are for combating Islamic extremism. But Turdakun is a Christian, who"https:\/\/www.theglobeandmail.com\/world\/article-in-xinjiang-incarceration-of-christians-and-han-chinese-shows-broad\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">researchers say<\/a> have also been targeted and arbitrarily detained by the state.<\/p>\nUnited Nations watchdogs say China has incarcerated at least a million of its own citizens in detention camps in recent years, but the figure is believed to be higher. The"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/12\/01\/federal-lorex-surveillance-ban\/\">Biden administration<\/a> declared China’s treatment of Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities a “genocide,” though Beijing has long denied allegations of human rights abuses.<\/p>\nTurdakun is only able to tell this story after U.S. immigration authorities granted him and his family"https:\/\/www.uscis.gov\/humanitarian\/humanitarian-or-significant-public-benefit-parole-for-individuals-outside-the-united-states\">advanced parole<\/a>, a temporary immigration status allowing them to enter the United States, after congressional lawmakers lobbied on their behalf. Turdakun and his wife, Zhyldyz Uraalieva, and their son arrived in Washington, D.C., on April 8.<\/p>\n“There is no freedom inside that place,” Turdakun said in an interview with TechCrunch, speaking through a translator, in Washington on Tuesday. Even after he was released under conditions similar to that of house arrest, Turdakun said he would be seen on facial recognition and harassed by police officers every time he left the house.<\/p>\n"attachment_2299931\" style=\"width: 410px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">"caption-attachment-2299931\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2299931\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/exif-photo-conor.jpg?w=565\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"481\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/exif-photo-conor.jpg 898w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/exif-photo-conor.jpg?resize=125,150 125w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/exif-photo-conor.jpg?resize=249,300 249w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/exif-photo-conor.jpg?resize=768,924 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/exif-photo-conor.jpg?resize=565,680 565w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/exif-photo-conor.jpg?resize=42,50 42w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" \/>"caption-attachment-2299931\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">IPVM government director Conor Healy (left), Ovalbek Turdakun, his son, and wife Zhyldyz (right) in Kyrgyzstan, taken before they arrived in the United States in April.
Image Credits:<\/strong> Conor Healy\/provided<\/p><\/div><\/p>\nAs a former prisoner, Turdakun is one of only a few people with a firsthand account of the inside of China’s detention camps, including rare knowledge of how the Chinese government uses technology, surveillance and facial recognition to oppress millions of Xinjiang residents, which U.S. lawmakers will use to investigate human rights abuses in China and the Chinese companies that supply surveillance technology to the camps.<\/p>\nA letter seen by TechCrunch that was sent by Rep. Chris Smith of New Jersey in support of Turdakun’s advance parole case said his knowledge will provide vital evidence regarding the “use of technology provided by Chinese companies such as Hikvision to facilitate gross violations of internationally recognized human rights by the Chinese government.”<\/p>\nSmith, whose office did not return a request for comment, is a vocal critic in Congress of China’s human rights record, including its use of surveillance technology for carrying out human rights violations.

Marco Rubio, vice-chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, also"https:\/\/www.axios.com\/xinjiang-china-camps-human-rights-abuse-witness-3c2de155-0f9a-4f2b-84e1-83713bb7e443.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reportedly<\/a> supported Turdakun’s immigration effort.<\/p>\nHikvision is one of the world’s largest suppliers of video surveillance cameras, making about $10 billion in profit in 2020.

In December, Healy met Turdakun and his family in Kyrgyzstan where they had been for the past year, to help them obtain their immigration paperwork onward to the United States, amid fears that the Kyrgyz authorities could deport the family back to China, Healy told TechCrunch.<\/p>\nIn one of the video interviews shared with TechCrunch, Healy showed Turdakun a photo of Hikvision’s logo, which the former prisoner immediately recognized, saying that it was the same logo on the cameras in the cells in the detention camp and littered throughout the city.<\/p>\nSpeaking with TechCrunch on Tuesday, Turdakun described the cells where he would be held with two dozen other prisoners for months at a time and how the cameras, all branded with Hikvision logos, were “always on and watching,” he said. If the cameras saw anyone speak, a booming voice would tell them not to talk.<\/p>\nHe described how the detainees would spend hours in silence, enforced by the cameras, and they would have little other human contact outside of the cells for extended periods; often the door would stay shut for long timespans and food would be pushed through a slot in the door. Even to move just a few feet to use the hole-shaped toilet that he described, you would still need to raise your hand and ask for permission “because of the cameras watching, always,” Turdakun said.<\/p>\nTurdakun was released in November 2018 on terms similar to house arrest, where he would be monitored around the clock from the GPS tracker on his wrist that could only be unlocked with a special key. Although he was allowed to leave his house and travel around his small city, he described constant harassment from the authorities.<\/p>\n“Every time,” he stressed when asked again.<\/p>\n“The cameras would see me and send off alarms,” he said, describing the use of facial recognition across his neighborhood. “The cameras are about [6 feet] in height \u2014 also Hikvision \u2014 and they’re on every sidewalk,” he said. “There are so many of them, they don’t need to change the directions of the cameras.

feel for internal phishing awareness, even despite the fact that phishing remains one of the leading causes of data breaches. HacWare, a New York-based startup and"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/17\/meet-the-five-startup-battlefield-finalists-at-disrupt-2020\/\">TechCrunch Battlefield finalist<\/a>, tries to"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/15\/hacware-email-security\/\">help employees hate phishing simulations a little less<\/a>, and it just landed $2.3 million in seed funding to expand its cybersecurity awareness and training offering.<\/p>\nThe idea behind HacWare is simple enough: It’s a service that integrates with your company’s Google Workspace or Office 365 and helps employees understand potential risks in incoming email and automates phishing simulations and cybersecurity training.<\/p>\nHacWare aims to give companies an easier onramp to provide meaningful and engaging cybersecurity training to their employees that they won’t hate or that gets in the way of their day-to-day work. The goal is to give employees the skills to protect their company from a growing range of inbound threats, many of which initially target their inbox in an effort to steal their passwords.<\/p>\nTiffany Ricks, a former ethical hacker and HacWare founder, knows what it’s like to be a startup that has to do more with less. Starting out with just a handful of people on her team, Ricks told TechCrunch that she plans to use the seed round raise to build out the startup’s engineering and sales team to help protect companies from identity theft and phishing attacks.<\/p>\n“This funding will allow HacWare to execute our product strategy goals for making cybersecurity training super adaptive and seamless for global workforces. We are re-imaging workplace training to coach company employees on how to protect their identities and combat phishing attacks,” said Ricks.<\/p>\nSince HacWare’s"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/video\/hacware-email-hacking-protection\/\">Battlefield appearance in 2020<\/a>, held virtually because of the COVID-19 pandemic, Ricks said the company paused its seed-round fundraise, reinvested its revenues back into the company and re-focused on its product. Ricks said it was part of a promise to put out a new product feature every week for a year. “Initially, it seemed impossible but every week we were releasing a fully functional feature, and putting out video content explaining the features,” she said. Ricks said focusing on what its customers wanted helped attract investors back to the seed round she had put on hold.<\/p>"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\nThe seed round was led by Elevate Capital, with participation from 2.0 Ventures, Aura Innovation Fund, Chai Angels and others.<\/p>\nThe funding will also help expand the company’s developer network to offer more ways for companies to integrate their internal applications and HR platforms directly with HacWare’s API with just a few lines of code. Ricks said the developer network is a key component to the company’s product strategy, especially given the shift to remote work driven by the pandemic.<\/p>\nElevate Capital founder and managing partner Nitin Rai, who invested in the round, is joining HacWare’s board.<\/p>\nRicks notes that,"https:\/\/news.crunchbase.com\/news\/something-ventured-black-women-founders\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">according to Crunchbase<\/a>, less than 1% of all venture capital funding went to Black female founders. By her count, Ricks is the 114th Black female founder to raise over $1 million in venture funding.<\/p>\n“I hope I am inspiring more Black women to dream and build big scalable businesses,” said Ricks.<\/p>\n"embed breakout\">\n"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"j3Sxc5JXPU\">"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/15\/hacware-email-security\/\">HacWare wants you to hate email security a little less<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"“HacWare wants you to hate email security a little less” — TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/15\/hacware-email-security\/embed\/#?secret=NkkiTBlsub#?secret=j3Sxc5JXPU\" data-secret=\"j3Sxc5JXPU\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"If you work at a company above a certain size, you’ll understand just how little patience we all feel for internal phishing awareness, even despite the fact that phishing remains one of the leading causes of data breaches.

famously wirelessly hacked a hospital insulin pump live on stage in front of hundreds of people to demonstrate how easily it could be compromised to deliver a lethal dose of medication. In the years that have passed, medical device security has gotten better, albeit with an"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/07\/09\/flaws-anesthesia-respiratory-devices-tampering\/\">occasional high-profile hiccup<\/a>. But researchers are now finding vulnerabilities in newer hospital technologies that weren’t as ubiquitous a decade ago.<\/p>\nEnter autonomous hospital robots, the supposed-to-be-friendly self-controlled digital workhorses that can transport medications, bed linens, food, medications and laboratory specimens across a hospital campus. These robots, such as the ones built by robot maker Aethon, are equipped with the space to transport critical goods and security access to enter restricted parts of the hospital and ride elevators, all while cutting labor costs.<\/p>\nBut researchers at Cynerio, a cybersecurity startup focused on securing hospital and healthcare systems, discovered a set of five never-before-seen vulnerabilities in Aethon robots, which they say allowed malicious hackers to remotely hijack and control these autonomous robots \u2014 and in some cases over the internet.<\/p>\nThe five vulnerabilities, which Cynerio collectively call JekyllBot:5, aren’t with the robots themselves but with the base servers that are used to communicate with and control the robots that traverse the hallways of the hospitals and hotels. The bugs range from allowing hackers to create new users with high-level access in order to then log in and remotely control the robots and access restricted areas, snoop on patients or guests using the robot’s in-built cameras or otherwise cause mayhem.<\/p>\nAsher Brass, the lead researcher on the Aethon vulnerabilities, warned that the flaws required a “very low skill set for exploitation.”<\/p>\n"attachment_2298553\" style=\"width: 1119px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">"caption-attachment-2298553\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout wp-image-2298553 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/robot-moving-aethon-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1109\" height=\"624\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/robot-moving-aethon-1.jpg 1109w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/robot-moving-aethon-1.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/robot-moving-aethon-1.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/robot-moving-aethon-1.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/robot-moving-aethon-1.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/robot-moving-aethon-1.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1109px) 100vw, 1109px\" \/>"caption-attachment-2298553\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A screenshot from one of the cameras on an Aethon TUG robot.

But although the robots’ functionality were protected by an “admin” account, the researchers said the vulnerabilities in the web interface could have allowed a hacker to interact with the robots without needing an admin password to log in.<\/p>\nOne of the five bugs, the researchers said, exposed robots to remote control using a joystick-style controller in the web interface, while exploiting another one of the bugs to interact with door locks, call and ride elevators, and open and close medication drawers.<\/p>\nFor the most part, the potential risk is limited if access to the robots’ base servers are confined to the local network, limiting access only to logged-in employees. The researchers said the risk was far greater for the hospitals, hotels or any other place that use these robots that have a base server connected to the internet, since the vulnerabilities can be triggered from anywhere on the internet.<\/p>\nCynerio said they found evidence of internet-exposed robots in hospitals as well as facilities providing care to veterans. Aethon touts its robots in hundreds of hospitals around the world, many in the United States, accounting for thousands of robots.<\/p>\nThe bugs were fixed in a batch of software and firmware updates released by Aethon, after Cynerio alerted the company to the issues. Aethon is said to have restricted internet-exposed servers to isolate the robots from potential remote attacks, and fixed other web-related vulnerabilities that affected the base station.<\/p>\nIn a statement given to TechCrunch, CEO of ST Engineering Aethon, Peter Seiff, confirmed the vulnerabilities but declined to answer our questions, such as what percentage of its customers’ autonomous robots had been patched following the software update.<\/p>\nRead more:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/03\/cbord-university-digital-locks\/\">How a simple security bug became a university campus \u2018master key\u2019<\/a><\/li>\n"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/07\/02\/smart-home-hub-flaws-unlock-doors\/\">Security flaws in a popular smart home hub let hackers unlock front doors<\/a><\/li>\n"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/02\/11\/why-are-internet-asset-startups-so-hot-right-now\/\">Why are cybersecurity asset management startups so hot right now?<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"A decade ago security researcher Barnaby Jack famously wirelessly hacked a hospital insulin pump live on stage in front of hundreds of people to demonstrate how easily it could be compromised to deliver a lethal dose of medication.

hacked new Pegasus victims weeks after Apple sought injunction"},"content":{"rendered":""speakable-summary\">"featured__span-first-words\">Investigators say they<\/span> have found evidence that a Jordanian journalist and human rights defender’s iPhone was hacked with the Pegasus spyware just weeks after Apple sued the spyware’s maker NSO Group to stop it from targeting Apple’s customers.<\/p>\nAward-winning journalist Suhair Jaradat’s phone was hacked with the notorious spyware as recently as December 5, 2021, according to an analysis of her phone by"https:\/\/www.frontlinedefenders.org\/en\/statement-report\/report-jordanian-human-rights-defenders-and-journalists-hacked-pegasus-spyware\">Front Line Defenders and Citizen Lab<\/a> that was shared with TechCrunch ahead of its publication. Jaradat was sent a WhatsApp message from someone impersonating a popular anti-government critic with links to the Pegasus spyware, compromising her phone. According to the forensic analysis, Jaradat’s iPhone was hacked several times in the preceding months and as far back as February 2021.<\/p>\nApple had filed a lawsuit against Israeli spyware maker NSO Group in November 2021, seeking a court-issued injunction aimed at banning NSO from using Apple’s products and services to develop and deploy hacks against its customers.<\/p>\nThe injunction would, if granted, make it more difficult for NSO to deploy its spyware since its stealthiest capabilities rely on abusing Apple’s own services, such as iMessage, to create Apple user accounts for delivering the malware. But so far the case has gotten off to a slow start after the first judge assigned to the case recused herself, with no decision on the case likely to be made any time before June.<\/p>\nThe NSO-built Pegasus spyware gives its government customers"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/07\/19\/toolkit-nso-pegasus-iphone-android\/\">near-complete access<\/a> to a target\u2019s device, including their personal data, photos, messages and precise location. Many victims have received text messages with malicious links, but Pegasus has more recently been able to silently hack iPhones without any user interaction, or so-called “zero-click” attacks.<\/p>\nApple last year bolstered iPhone security by introducing BlastDoor, a new but unseen security feature designed to filter out malicious payloads sent over iMessage that could compromise a device. But NSO was found to have circumvented the security measure with a new exploit, which"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/08\/24\/nso-pegasus-bahrain-iphone-security\/\">researchers named ForcedEntry<\/a> for its ability to break through BlastDoor’s protections. Apple"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/09\/13\/apple-zero-day-nso-pegasus\/\">fixed BlastDoor<\/a> in September after the NSO exploit was found to affect iPads, Macs, and Apple Watches, not just iPhones.<\/p>\nApple declined to comment on the record when reached about the new report prior to publication.<\/p>\nJaradat is one of several Jordanians, including human rights defenders, lawyers and fellow journalists whose phones were compromised likely by agencies of the Jordanian government, according to Front Line Defenders and Citizen Lab’s findings out Tuesday.<\/p>\nAmong the others targeted include Malik Abu Orabi, a human rights lawyer whose work has included defending the teachers’ union, which in 2019 led the longest public sector strike in the country’s history. Abu Orabi’s phone was targeted as early as August 2019 until June 2021. Also, the phone of Ahmed Al-Neimat, a human rights defender and anti-corruption activist, was targeted by the ForcedEntry exploit in February 2021. The researchers said the hacking of Al-Neimat’s phone is believed to be the earliest suspected use of ForcedEntry.<\/p>\nAnother Jordanian journalist and human rights defender’s phone was targeted, according to the researchers, but who asked for her identity not to be disclosed.<\/p>\nApple is the latest tech giant to file suit against NSO for hacking into its customers’ phones. NSO is also currently embroiled in a legal battle with Facebook for using"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/10\/29\/whatsapp-spyware-nso-group\/\">a then-unknown vulnerability in WhatsApp<\/a> to hack into some 1,400 phones belonging to members of civil society. Last year, a U.S. appeals court rejected NSO’s claim that it was entitled to protection of a foreign sovereign, in this case Israel.<\/p>\nNSO has long said it sells its spyware only to law enforcement and intelligence agencies. In a statement, spokesperson Liron Bruck said that while the company has not seen the report, “the use of cyber tools in order to monitor dissidents, activists and journalists is a severe misuse of any technology and goes against the desired use of such critical tools.” NSO declined to answer our specific questions.<\/p>\nA spokesperson for the Jordanian Embassy in Washington DC did not comment by press time, but provided a statement after publication, in which it “categorically denied” the allegations, adding that the kingdom “has not cooperated with any agents with the aim of spying on citizens’ phones or censoring their calls.”<\/p>\nAccording to the U.S. State Department, Jordan is accused of “significant human rights issues,” including censorship, restrictions on free speech, and “substantial restrictions on freedom of association and freedom of peaceful assembly.”<\/p>\nUpdated with comment from the Jordanian government.<\/em><\/p>\n"embed breakout\">\n"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"CnLEYLO7Js\">"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/09\/13\/apple-zero-day-nso-pegasus\/\">Apple patches an NSO zero-day flaw affecting all devices<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"“Apple patches an NSO zero-day flaw affecting all devices” — TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/09\/13\/apple-zero-day-nso-pegasus\/embed\/#?secret=RE9AYZr8RE#?secret=CnLEYLO7Js\" data-secret=\"CnLEYLO7Js\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Investigators say they have found evidence that a Jordanian journalist and human rights defender’s iPhone was hacked with the Pegasus spyware just weeks after Apple sued the spyware’s maker NSO Group to stop it from targeting Apple’s customers.

year<\/a> ahead of its launch: Skiff is a web app that has much of the same document-writing and sharing capabilities as Google Docs but is built on a foundation of"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/tag\/end-to-end-encryption\/\">end-to-end encryption<\/a>, so Skiff does not have access to users’ documents like Google does. The startup already has more than 20,000 people using its platform, leaps ahead of the 8,000 waitlisted users it had when we first spoke to the company last May.<\/p>\nBut it’s the end-to-end encryption platform that Skiff relies on that holds the keys to the company’s future. Now with $10.5 million in Series A funding in the bank, Skiff’s co-founders Andrew Milich and Jason Ginsberg tell TechCrunch that the company is working toward becoming the “application layer for the decentralized web.”<\/p>\nA core part of the company’s efforts have been on decentralization, a process that allows its users to take ownership of their data. Over the past year Skiff has partnered with Protocol Labs to offer decentralized storage, known as IPFS, or the"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/19\/brave-web-browser-adds-native-support-for-peer-to-peer-ipfs-protocol\/\">Interplanetary File System<\/a>, which allows Skiff to encrypt their documents and scatter them across a network of storage hosts, as well as integrating MetaMask, letting users sign in to Skiff using a portable crypto wallet instead of an email address.<\/p>\n“The way we look at it is Web 2.0 is really about moving information around and web3 is about moving value around,” said Ginsberg, Skiff’s CTO, in a call. “Data is the most valuable thing on the internet, and our goal is that you really should own your own data.”<\/p>\nGinsberg said the company is focused on growing its product offering, such as communication, and allowing users to share more kinds of data on its platform.<\/p>\n“We see hundreds of millions of people choosing privacy products not really meeting the needs of working together remotely, and so that’s really where we see Skiff coming in. There’s tons of different products that we could do along those lines. We’re most interested right now in exploring products that not just deal with the document side of things, but also the communication side,” said Ginsberg.<\/p>\nMilich, the startup’s chief executive, said the round \u2014 led by Sequoia as a returning investor \u2014 will help the company build out those new products that also rely on end-to-end encryption, like communication. Skiff currently has a team of 15 employees dotted across the globe, Milich said. The Series A brings Skiff’s total funding to about $14 million.<\/p>\n\u201cSkiff is building an amazing team and visionary products to lead this moment,” said Konstantine Buhler, a partner at Sequoia. “We couldn\u2019t be more excited to double down.”<\/p>\n"embed breakout\">\n"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"ovSVa2qy9F\">"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/26\/skiff-encrypted-collaboration-seed\/\">Skiff, an end-to-end encrypted alternative to Google Docs, raises $3.7M seed<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"“Skiff, an end-to-end encrypted alternative to Google Docs, raises $3.7M seed” — TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/26\/skiff-encrypted-collaboration-seed\/embed\/#?secret=NwsyJlSLJN#?secret=ovSVa2qy9F\" data-secret=\"ovSVa2qy9F\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Six months after launching its end-to-end encrypted document editor, Skiff has bagged another $10.5 million in fresh funding to build out private and collaborative workspaces for its burgeoning customer base.

found a spreadsheet of accounts as they breached Okta, documents show"},"content":{"rendered":""speakable-summary\">The Lapsus$ hackers used compromised credentials to break into the network of customer service giant Sitel in January, days before subsequently accessing the internal systems of authentication giant Okta, according to documents seen by TechCrunch that provide new details of the cyber intrusion that have not yet been reported.<\/p>\nCustomers only learned of Okta’s January security breach on March 22 after the Lapsus$ hacking group"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/22\/okta-january-hack-breach\/\">published screenshots<\/a> revealing it had accessed Okta’s internal apps and systems some two months earlier. Okta admitted the compromise in"https:\/\/support.okta.com\/help\/s\/article\/Frequently-Asked-Questions-Regarding-January-2022-Compromise?language=en_US\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a blog post<\/a>, and later confirmed 366 of its corporate customers are affected by the breach, or about 2.5% of its customer base.<\/p>\nThe documents provide the most detailed account to date of the Sitel compromise, which allowed the hackers to later gain access to Okta’s network.<\/p>\nOkta is used by thousands of organizations and governments worldwide as a single sign-on provider, allowing employees to securely access a company\u2019s internal systems, such as email accounts, applications, databases and more.<\/p>\nThe documents, obtained by independent security researcher"https:\/\/twitter.com\/BillDemirkapi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bill Demirkapi<\/a> and shared with TechCrunch, include a Sitel customer communication sent on January 25 — more than a week after hackers first compromised its network — and a detailed timeline of the Sitel intrusion compiled by incident response firm Mandiant dated March 17 that was shared with Okta.<\/p>\nAccording to the documents, Sitel said it discovered the security incident in its VPN gateways on a legacy network belonging to Sykes, a customer service company working for Okta that Sitel acquired in 2021. VPNs, or virtual private networks, are often"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/07\/23\/corporate-vpn-flaws-risk\/\">a target for attackers<\/a> since they can be exploited to remotely access a company’s network.<\/p>\nThe timeline details how the attackers used remote access services and publicly accessible hacking tools to compromise and navigate through Sitel’s network, gaining deeper visibility to the network over the five days that Lapsus$ had access. Sitel said that its Azure cloud infrastructure was also compromised by hackers.<\/p>\nAccording to the timeline, the hackers accessed a spreadsheet on Sitel’s internal network early on January 21 called “DomAdmins-LastPass.xlsx.” The filename suggests that the spreadsheet contained passwords for domain administrator accounts that were exported from a Sitel employee’s LastPass password manager. Sitel spokesperson Matt Jaffe did not dispute this characterization when reached by TechCrunch prior to publication, but instead declined to comment. A day after publication, Sitel said in a statement that the spreadsheet “simply listed account names from legacy Sykes but did not contain any passwords,” but did not offer any evidence for this claim.<\/p>\nAbout five hours later, the hackers created a new Sykes user account and added the account to a user group called “tenant administrators,” which have broad access to the organization, likely to create a “backdoor” account to Sitel’s network that the hackers could use if they were later discovered and locked out. The Lapsus$ hackers were compromising Okta’s network at around the same time, according to"https:\/\/support.okta.com\/help\/s\/article\/Frequently-Asked-Questions-Regarding-January-2022-Compromise?language=en_US\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Okta’s timeline<\/a> of events.<\/p>\nThe timeline shows that the hackers last accessed Sitel’s network on January 21 at 2 p.m. (UTC), around 14 hours after accessing the spreadsheet. Sitel issued a company-wide password reset to try to lock out the attackers.<\/p>\nOkta has faced criticism for not warning customers sooner of the Sitel breach following its receipt of Mandiant’s report dated March 17. Okta chief security officer David Bradbury said the company “should have moved more swiftly to understand its implications.”<\/p>\nOkta was unable to comment when reached prior to publication. Mandiant also did not dispute the contents of the reports but declined to comment.<\/p>\nOkta is just one of several big-name companies targeted by the Lapsus$ hacking and extortion group in recent months.

In an"https:\/\/www.okta.com\/blog\/2022\/03\/oktas-investigation-of-the-january-2022-compromise\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">updated statement<\/a> on Wednesday, Okta’s chief security officer David Bradbury confirmed the subprocessor is a company called Sykes, which last year was acquired by Miami-based contact center giant Sitel.<\/p>\nCustomer support companies like Sykes and Sitel often have wide access to the organizations that they support for facilitating customer requests. Malicious hackers have previously targeted customer support companies, which often have weaker cybersecurity defenses than some of the highly-secured companies that they support.

According to Bradbury, Sitel engaged an unnamed forensics firm to investigate, which concluded on March 10. Only a week later was the report turned over to Okta on March 17.<\/p>\nBradbury said he is “greatly disappointed by the long period of time that transpired between our notification to Sitel and the issuance of the complete investigation report,” and admitted that Okta “should have moved more swiftly” to understand the report’s implications.<\/p>\nBut an email from a Sitel representative disputed how Okta characterized the report, saying that the security breach “did not impact legacy Sitel Group systems or networks; only legacy Sykes’ network was affected.” (The Sitel representative declared their email “off the record,” which requires both parties to agree to the terms in advance. We are printing the responses since we were given no opportunity to decline.) The email added: “We have not found evidence of a security breach of client’s systems or networks on legacy Sykes or Sitel Group side.” The email also said that the Sitel has no evidence of a data breach, but the company declined to say if it has the means, such as logs, to determine what, if any, data was accessed or exfiltrated by the attackers. Sitel would not name the forensics firm that investigated the breach.<\/p>\nAn earlier statement attributed to Sitel spokesperson Rebecca Sanders said: “As a result of the investigation, along with our ongoing assessment of external threats, we are confident there is no longer a security risk. We are unable to comment on our relationship with any specific brands or the nature of the services we provide for our clients.”<\/p>\nOkta has not yet responded to TechCrunch’s questions regarding the breach.<\/p>\n"embed breakout\">\n"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"vWGiLUPBwP\">"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/22\/okta-january-hack-breach\/\">Okta confirms January breach after hackers publish screenshots of its internal network<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"“Okta confirms January breach after hackers publish screenshots of its internal network” — TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/22\/okta-january-hack-breach\/embed\/#?secret=BFOrJ6ls3I#?secret=vWGiLUPBwP\" data-secret=\"vWGiLUPBwP\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Okta says 366 corporate customers, or about 2.5% of its customer base, were impacted by a security breach that allowed hackers to access the company’s internal network.

Lapsus$ claimed it did not steal data from Okta, and that its focus was on targeting Okta customers.<\/p>\nOkta is used by thousands of organizations and governments worldwide as a single sign-on provider, allowing employees to securely access a company’s internal systems, such as email accounts, calendars, applications and more.<\/p>\nOkta chief executive Todd McKinnon"https:\/\/twitter.com\/toddmckinnon\/status\/1506184721922859010\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">confirmed<\/a> the breach in a tweet thread overnight on March 22: “In late January 2022, Okta detected an attempt to compromise the account of a third party customer support engineer working for one of our subprocessors. The matter was investigated and contained by the subprocessor.”<\/p>\n“We believe the screenshots shared online are connected to this January event. Based on our investigation to date, there is no evidence of ongoing malicious activity beyond the activity detected in January.”<\/p>\nOkta has not yet named the subprocessor, and has not yet responded to TechCrunch’s questions about the breach.<\/p>\nIn an updated statement, Okta’s chief security officer David Bradbury said the compromise was with one of Okta’s third-party providers over a five-day window between January 16-21, 2022.

security lapse exposed India’s CISF personnel files and health records"},"content":{"rendered":""speakable-summary\">Internal documents, officer health records, and personnel files belonging to India’s Central Industrial Security Force spilled online because of a data security lapse.<\/p>\nA security researcher in India, who asked not to be named for fear of retaliation from the Indian government, found a database packed with network logs generated by a security appliance connected to CISF’s network. But the database was not secured with a password, allowing anyone on the internet to access the logs from their web browser.<\/p>\nThe network logs contain detailed records of which files on CISF’s network were accessed or blocked because of security rules. Because the logs contained full web addresses of documents stored on CISF’s network, it was possible for anyone on the internet to access the logs and then open those files in their browser directly from CISF’s network, also without needing a password.<\/p>\nThe logs contained records for more than 246,000 web addresses of PDF documents on CISF’s network, many of which relate to personnel files and health records and contain personally identifiable information on CISF officers. Some of the files are dated as recently as 2022.<\/p>\nCISF is one of the largest police forces in the world with more than 160,000 personnel, tasked with protecting government facilities, infrastructure and airport security across the country.<\/p>\nThe researcher said the security appliance is built by Haltdos, an India-based security company that provides network security technology to organizations. The database was first found to be exposed on March 6, according to Shodan, a search engine for exposed devices and databases. TechCrunch confirmed that the database was configured with the name “haltdos.”<\/p>\nHaltdos CEO Anshul Saxena did not respond to multiple requests for comment. TechCrunch also emailed a CISF public affairs officer with several web addresses of publicly exposed files stored on its servers, but we did not receive a response. It’s not uncommon for government organizations in India to quietly fix security issues when alerted by good-faith security researchers but then rebuff or deny the claims when they invariably become public knowledge.<\/p>\nThe database and the security appliance are no longer online.
