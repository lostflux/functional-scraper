AboutMachineScienceConstructionAssemblyNews & MediaTopRisingThe exterior walls of the Tritium Building (level L3) are rising. Two other levels will follow: L4 and L5.
03 December 2021At nightThe Tokamak Complex, at the heart of the construction site, is captured at night by the ITER photographer. The ITER worksite hardly ever sleeps; when employees leave their offices and head home, the night shift begins for dozens of workers and specialists.
12 November 2021Pour daysConcrete pouring continues on level L3 of the Tritium Building.
20 October 2021Working on L3 of the Tritium BuildingTwo levels of the Tritium Building have been erected; in this photo we can see the teams active on the basemat for L3. When it is completed, the Tritium Building will rise to the height of the concrete segment of the Tokamak Building in the background.

06 October 2021Elevator shaftITER's cask and plug remote handling system will transport components between the Tokamak Building and the Hot Cell Complex. We are looking at the elevator shaft for the lift that will service the casks at upper, equatorial and lower machine levels. © Christian Luenig (www.arbeitsblende.de)29 September 2021Readying the supportsAll through the Diagnostic Building, plant assembly teams are installing ceiling supports for equipment.
28 September 2021Visiting the heart of ITERIt is still possible to enter the Tokamak Building to view machine assembly close up. In this photo, European Union Commissioner for Energy Kadri Simson is accompanied by ITER Director-General Bernard Bigot.
17 September 2021Planned completion: 2023Work on the Tritium Building resumed this year. The final level (L5) should be completed in the spring of 2023. While most of the functions of the Tritium Building are directly linked to full-power operation at ITER, the building also hosts equipment that must be in place by First Plasma.

Cryostat welding begins later this month. © Les Nouveaux Médias/SNC ENGAGE04 September 2020The assembly theatreAbout 150 metres separates the double doors of the Assembly Hall, which open to receive components, from the Tokamak pit. All components will spend some time in the Assembly Hall for unpacking, measurement and test activities before the final lift into place. © Les Nouveaux Médias/SNC ENGAGE04 September 202046 rather particular doorsInstalled all around the tokamak machine at three levels, these port cell doors double in weight (from 30 to 60 tonnes) when filled with dense, neutron-blocking concrete. The last of 46 doors was installed in June by European Domestic Agency contractors.
19 June 2020First piece installedThe first piece of the ITER Tokamak—the soup-dish-shaped base of the cryostat (1,250 tonnes)—was lowered into the Tokamak pit on 26 May. It fit perfectly. Photo: ITER Organization/EJF Riche28 May 2020Cladding completedMetal cladding now completely covers the crane hall of the Tokamak Building.
26 May 2020Major machine assembly milestoneOn Tuesday 26 May, the first major machine component—the cryostat base—is lifted by overhead crane and lowered into the Tokamak assembly pit.
26 May 2020Perfectly cleanThe machine assembly "well" is perfectly clean and ready to receive machine components. The 18 cylindrical cryostat support bearings are clearly visible, like jewels in the supporting crown.
26 May 2020Final nuclear doorsThe last nuclear doors are delivered through a Level 1 door of the Tokamak Complex. By next month, all 46 will have been installed. © Les Nouveaux Médias/SNC ENGAGE15 May 2020The Tokamak ComplexThe Tokamak Building now mirrors the Assembly Hall. To either side of it, the Diagnostics Building (centre) and the Tritium Building (left) are still under construction. © Les Nouveaux Médias/SNC ENGAGE15 May 2020Covers offOne of the last things to do at the bottom of the Tokamak pit—uncover the cryostat bearings, which until now had been hidden under thick protective wrapping.
13 May 2020Match exactlyThe pedestal of the cryostat base will be affixed to the female lugs seen here in the wall of the bioshield (steel rectangles). To meet these interfacing pieces, the base must be positioned as it is lowered with a tolerance of +/-5 mm.
13 May 202018 cryostat bearingsA set of 18 spherical bearings, evenly spaced and deeply anchored into the "crown," will bear the full weight of the machine and, acting as ball-and-socket joints, will enable the smooth transfer of horizontal and rotational forces.
13 May 202030 metres deepTwo sets of overhead cranes (2 x 750 tonnes and 2 x 50 tonnes) will be responsible for the ballet of activity as components ready for installation are picked up in the Assembly Hall and brought to the 30-metre deep Tokamak pit. Photo: Gérard Lesénéchal06 May 2020On the pit floorPainted and cleaned, everything is nearly ready in the Tokamak pit for the first machine components. Photo: Gérard Lesénéchal06 May 2020Assembly theatreThe ''assembly theatre'' is a vast space that encompasses the assembly and crane halls. In the foreground, the opening of the assembly pit; in the background (past the twin sector sub-assembly tools), the cryostat base is being groomed for the upcoming assembly operations.
04 May 2020Getting readyThe Tokamak pit is nearly ready for its first machine component: 18 cryostat bearings are in place on the cryostat crown, contractors are finalizing painting and cleaning, and captive components have been installed in areas that will be blocked once the cryostat base has been lowered.
02 April 2020The lid is offStanding at the end of the Tokamak Building, looking over the Tokamak pit toward the Assembly Hall. The temporary lid has been removed and installation activities are about to start.
02 April 2020One segment at a timeThe temporary lid over the assembly pit is made of 11 segments ranging in weight from 10 to over 80 tonnes.
02 April 202011 segments in allOnce the central segment have been removed, two half-moon segments remain. At 80 tonnes each, they are the heaviest elements of the lid removal operation, which took two days to complete.
02 April 2020One half moonSpecialists attach a pair of hoisting beams to one of the two "half-moon" segments, bringing the total weight of the load to approximately 100 tonnes.
02 April 2020Last pieceAs the last segment of the lid is raised, it reveals a spectacular view of the 30-metre-deep assembly pit.
02 April 2020Final crane path testsTotalling approximately 1,000 tonnes, these loads are travelling the way of future ITER components, and permitting the European Domestic Agency to validate ITER Council milestone #50, for crane access in the newly completed Tokamak Building.
28 March 2020A delicate thresholdThe loads are about to cross from the Assembly Hall into the Tokamak Building. The cranes will halt at the threshold to allow the loads to be moved back and forth along the crane's yellow beams to monitor the deflection of the crane runway and that of the crane hall pillars.
28 March 2020Coming nextPart of the circular lid that closes the assembly pit has already been taken down, allowing a dizzying view into the 30-metre-deep concrete cylinder. The removal of the 11 segments that make up the lid is scheduled to begin on Thursday 2 April and last through the end of the work week.
28 March 2020Carefully supervisingThe load path operation was overseen by Roberto Lanza (left, ITER Responsible Officer for cranes and crane operations) and Duco Jensen (ITER site planning coordinator), with strong support from construction coordinator Stéphane Herpin. The operation involved personnel from the Buildings Infrastructure & Power Supplies (BIPS) Project Team; Fusion for Energy contractors VFR (Vinci, Ferrovial, Razel-Bec), REEL (cranes), Dalkia, GDES, Martifer (manufacturing and installation of the crane hall), SAMT, and Nuvia; and contractors supporting both the ITER Organization and Fusion for Energy (Engage, APAVE, Energhia, Tiresia, and MOMENTUM).
28 March 2020The numbers on the scaleThe weight of the loads appears in real time on the small screens just above the rails. Figures can vary slightly depending on the positions of the loads along the beams.
28 March 2020Preparing for episode oneAs the European Domestic Agency puts the finishing touches on work in the Tokamak pit (painting, cleaning), ITER's Construction Management-as-Agent contractor MOMENTUM is preparing for the first episode of machine assembly: the lowering of the cryostat base.
26 March 2020Getting readyAt the bottom of the Tokamak pit, teams are preparing for the arrival of the cryostat base.
26 March 2020Ready to paintPainting continues in the Tokamak Building crane hall.
26 March 2020Late into the eveningThese workers, present just as Saturday turns into Sunday, are following recommended distance and personal protection measures.
26 March 2020Open for assemblyThere is no longer a barrier separating the Assembly Hall from the Tokamak Building. In the next step, the temporary lid over the machine assembly pit will be dismantled and removed.
26 March 2020Wall comes downThe last piece of temporary wall is removed, creating a single-volume space for the pre-assembly and assembly of the ITER machine.
10 March 2020Fully containedThe volume of the crane hall (right) is now fully framed out. When the interior partition wall is removed, the buildings will form one continuous assembly space.
26 February 2020Covered completelyNatural light over the Tokamak pit is a thing of the past, as the last panel of metal cladding (layer one) is positioned on 25 February.
25 February 2020Cladding, layer oneFirst-level cladding is nearly complete on the Tokamak Building crane hall. At the end of construction, the building will have the same exterior treatment as the Assembly Hall.
21 February 2020100,000 embedded platesAll of the equipment in the Tokamak Complex will be attached to embedded plates. These metal plates have long prongs that are inserted deep into the concrete walls for support. There are at least 100,000 of them. © Les Nouveaux Médias/SNC ENGAGE15 February 2020Cryostat base: grand opening soonThe huge cryostat base section will descend from above, supported by the overhead cranes as it is lowered 30 metres to the bottom of the pit.
13 February 2020Interface pointsFemale lugs on the bioshield wall will interface with male lugs on the cryostat base's pedestal rim. A high-precision drill is boring holes into one of the 18 female lugs to accommodate a steel pin.
13 February 2020More doorsTwo nuclear doors are delivered to the ground level of the Tokamak Building. © Les Nouveaux Médias/SNC ENGAGE08 February 2020170 metresSeeing the building from this angle, it's easy to imagine the overhead cranes travelling 170 metres from the entrance of the Assembly Hall (far left) to over the Tokamak assembly pit (far right). Cladding is advancing quickly.
06 February 2020Late January: progress is swiftThe frame of the crane hall is nearly complete and a first layer of cladding now covers the south wall and part of the roof.
30 January 2020At the bottom of the pitTeams are active at the bottom of the Tokamak pit to prepare for the insertion of the first machine component: the cryostat base. © Les Nouveaux Médias/SNC ENGAGE29 January 2020The mechanics under the machineThe concrete crown (left) that will sit under the machine is supported by 18 radial walls (centre). 18 cryostat bearings (covered in grey) will be the interface points between the 1,250-tonne cryostat base and the crown. © Les Nouveaux Médias/SNC ENGAGE29 January 2020The sun rises on the crane hall, which is nearly entirely framed out. © Les Nouveaux Médias/SNC ENGAGE27 January 2020Hinges and framesBefore each nuclear door can be installed, massive frames and hinges must be mounted at port cell exits. © Les Nouveaux Médias/SNC ENGAGE25 January 2020How quickly it goes!Workers on elevated platforms install the steel framework elements of the north wall. Another four days and it will be completed.
23 January 2020Capable of lifting 60 tonnesIn this embedded-plate-studded galley of the Tokamak Complex, a red "leaf mounting" tool is parked. This specialized tool was created by contractor Cegelec/Sommer to move the massive port cell doors to the concrete pouring station and back to their final installation locations. It is equipped with two large holding frames that clutch the port cell door like a sandwich.© Les Nouveaux Médias/SNC ENGAGE20 January 2020One step awayWith the Tokamak Building now topped by the steel structure of its crane hall, the main building on the ITER worksite is just a step away from its final aspect.
13 January 2020A peekEvocative of a stage with black curtains, the vertical opening at the centre of this image offers a glimpse of the ongoing activity inside the adjacent Assembly Hall.
13 January 2020Crane hall: framed outThe complete crane hall structure—20 tall pillars and roof modules included—weighs approximately 2,000 tonnes. Contractors are currently installing the secondary steel structure (crossbars, etc), tightening bolts, and touching up paint.
08 January 2020Adjusting torqueIn different areas of the roof structure, teams are tightening bolts and adjusting torque. First-level cladding will completely cover the structure by late February, allowing the bridge cranes to be brought into the new volume over the Tokamak pit for testing and commissioning.
08 January 2020In one monthJust inside the metal frame are the massive "runway beams" that will support the weight of the bridge cranes and their heavy loads. The beams are ready to receive the crane rails; installation work begins this week.
08 January 2020Cladding beginsThe first panels of steel cladding appear on the south side of the crane hall.
19 December 2019Without a hitchThe last roof module is moved into position on 11 December. The complete roof structure—20 tall pillars and roof modules included—weighs approximately 2,000 tonnes.
13 December 2019And a secondBecause the first module was lifted and installed without technical incident, European Domestic Agency contractors were able to proceed with a second lift on the same day.
04 December 201970 metres above groundThe preassembled modules are raised 70 metres overhead before being positioned on the waiting pillars. A second crawler crane (under construction at the right of the image) will be necessary for the last operations.
04 December 2019First of fiveThe five modules weigh between 62 and 78 tonnes and span a distance of 50 metres between the two rows of pillars. A giant crawler crane—with a boom spanning more than 100 metres—was put in place for the lift operation.
04 December 2019First roof moduleThe first module of the crane hall roof is lifted on 4 December, in an operation that begins at 7:00 a.m.

These will be lifted from 4 December on.
03 December 2019All pillars in placeTwo rows of pillars, ten on each side, have been installed on the top of the Tokamak Building. Approximately one-third of the way up the pillars, are the sturdy supports for the assembly crane rails.
28 November 2019The golden hourSecond-level pillars have risen all along the right wall of the Tokamak Building crane hall. European teams plan to pose the first roof module in December.
18 November 201946 to installAll around the tokamak are galleries full of equipment, which must be closed off by nuclear doors (photo). The teams have 46 to install. © Les Nouveaux Médias/SNC ENGAGE15 November 2019On the roofFrench journalists stand on the top of the Tokamak Building, among the strong pillars of the roof structure, on the day that the ITER community celebrates the end of civil work on the Tokamak Building.
07 November 2019Last concrete for Tokamak BuildingForty-five metres above platform level, the final concrete pour of the Tokamak Building is achieved at L4 level on 7 November. Only the roof structure remains.
07 November 2019First level pillars nearly installedPillars are now aligned along both sides of the Tokamak Building rooftop and bracing bars are being installed between the pillars. A second crawler crane will be set up on the far side to help handle the heavy roof modules that will be installed between mid-December and mid-January.

The last concrete pour for the area around the central well is scheduled for early November. Photo: ITER Organization/EJF Riche24 October 2019The crane hall begins to emergeFrom the top of one of the worksite cranes, it is easy to imagine how the heavy lift bridge cranes will execute their back-and-forth ballet between the Assembly Hall (in black) and the Tokamak Building.
14 October 2019Between two cloudsHighlighted by the sun are the 10 south pillars of the crane gallery, installed at level L5 of the Tokamak Building.
14 October 201912 pillars and countingTwo rows of pillars have now appeared at the top of the ITER Tokamak Building. When 10 have been installed on each side, contractors will begin installing second-level pillars.
07 October 201946 nuclear doorsEach of the galleries immediately surrounding the machine will be sealed off by a 60-tonne nuclear door (pictured). Each one has been fitted with a personnel access door. © Les Nouveaux Médias/SNC ENGAGE25 September 2019Filled with concreteThe nuclear doors are delivered hollow, and then filled with 7.5 cubic metres of heavy concrete. Special tools have been developed to handle the 60-tonne doors and mount them on their hinges. © Les Nouveaux Médias/SNC ENGAGE25 September 2019Elements of the roof structureThe first transversal roof elements will be lifted in December. © Les Nouveaux Médias/SNC ENGAGE25 September 2019Carefully nowTwenty-four anchors in the plinth of the corbel had to be matched perfectly with 24 bolts under the pillar. A dozen specialists were on hand for the final insertion operation.
11 September 2019Special shelvesThe shelf-like protrusions on the interior surface of the pillars will support the crane rails that must be extended out over the Tokamak pit.
11 September 201920 pillars in allTwenty pillars (10 on either side of the Tokamak Building) will support the roof of the crane hall as well allow the overhead crane rails to be extended from the Assembly Hall into the Tokamak Building.
11 September 2019Steel pillar section #1The first crane hall pillar section is lifted on 11 September. This is the lower, 13-metre-tall section of one pillar. An upper section, 16 metres tall, will be added later.
11 September 2019First crawler crane in actionOn 11 September, this crawler crane began lifting pillars to the top of the Tokamak Building for the metal roof of the crane hall.
05 September 2019First cryostat bearingEighteen semi-spherical bearings anchored deep in the Tokamak support crown will act like ball-and-socket joints under the pedestal of the cryostat to allow the smooth transfer of forces generated during machine operation. The first one has been installed.
04 September 2019Clockwork precision for a 3.5-tonne componentAs a fastening system for the bearings, a steel transition piece is half embedded in the concrete crown during the first phase of pouring. Then, a high-strength top plate (3.5 tonnes of steel) is positioned on the transition piece to receive the bearings with a mechanical blocking mechanism worthy of a Swiss watch. Permitted tolerances for the different elements of the fastening system will be less the 2 mm.
04 September 2019Crane hall comingTo the right of the Tokamak Complex, contractors are assembling one of two crawler cranes that will be used to install the metal structure of the crane hall.
04 September 2019Transfer of force through the lugsAnchored and bolted in the wall surrounding the cryostat crown, 18 of these 2.5-tonne rectangular steel pieces ("female lugs") will play a key role in transferring horizontal forces to the bioshield structure and protecting the integrity of the machine. They will match with the "male lugs" welded on the cryostat pedestal.
04 September 2019The precision of a clockmakerTeams have been active all summer at the very bottom of the Tokamak pit, in preparation for the installation of the cryostat base. On top of the concrete crown, at the point of intersection with each of its 18 radial walls, contractors are installing a set of 18 metal bearings. (If you look closely you'll see that one has been installed in its socket and protected under black cloth, while—moving in a counter clockwise direction—other interfacing areas are in various stages of preparation.)04 September 2019The poster is goneA large poster of the ITER machine used to adorn the temporary wall of the Assembly Hall. It has been removed as part of the dismantling process for the wall itself.
04 September 2019Major milestone aheadFor years, crane #1 has supported activities in the Tokamak Building from its central location, anchored at the bottom of the machine well. Before the end of the year it will be dismantled to allow for the installation of the metal walls and roof of the crane hall. Once the building has a roof, the temporary lid of the bioshield can be removed and the project will have reached a major milestone on the road to the official start of machine assembly.
04 September 2019A wall in whiteA thick coat of white paint has changed the look of the north wall, which stands between the Tokamak and Tritium buildings.

Teams have been working to complete the job in this 25,000 cubic-metre space since early March; now only finishing touches remain.
03 July 2019Tokamak-sur-merAt the height of the heat wave, in late June, surface temperature on the ITER worksite climbed to the 50 °C range. To continue work—and protect workers—a series of measures was implemented: the morning shifts began earlier, longer pauses were granted, cool mist vaporizers were installed, and... parasols made an appearance.

17 June 2019A site that never sleepsAn average of 300 trucks pass through the gates of the ITER worksite every day. Ongoing construction requires a huge amount of material—rebar to reinforce the concrete, huge formwork panels, steel columns, backfill soil, pipes by the kilometre, paint ... All the indispensable supplies for one of the world's biggest construction sites.
13 June 2019Amid field and forestITER is an outpost of activity in an otherwise sparsely populated region. The site was cleared more than a decade ago on land belonging to the CEA Cadarache research centre in a bend of the Durance River Valley.
12 June 2019Massive concrete structureIn the five years since the completion of the Tokamak Complex foundations, the Tokamak Building has risen seven levels. Work is about to start on the metal frame that will complete the structure.
12 June 2019Crane hall columnsThe steel pillars for the crane hall are beginning to arrive on site. Pictured is the lower segment of one pillar, which will be installed directly on the Tokamak Building.

The embedded plates visible on all surfaces will allow contractors to attach the supports required for installing plant systems.
14 December 2018Lower galleriesThis opening in the 3.5-metre-thick bioshield was specially designed to house the part of the feeder that crosses through the bioshield and cryostat—the feedthrough. Thirty-one feeders in all will find their way through galleries like this to reach the ITER magnets.
06 December 2018Installed!Into the slim opening of the cryostat crown: a break in the concrete had been left by building contractors for the installation of the cryostat feedthrough for poloidal field coil #4. The operation was successfully carried out on 6 December.
06 December 2018A covered wellThe temporary lid on the bioshield prevents us from seeing 30 metres down onto the floor of the Tokamak Complex, where the concrete crown and radial walls are in place. In 2019, 18 steel bearings will be installed in a ring to prepare for the first big lift of ITER assembly—the lowering of the cryostat base.
06 December 2018"As installed"At the bottom of the machine assembly pit, the first metal component has been inserted into its bay. Metrologists are recording its "as-installed" position, as this component will be assembled with two other sub-assemblies to form the full magnet feeder for poloidal field coil #4. Thirty-one feeders in all will deliver electricity, cryogens and instruments to the ITER magnets.
06 December 2018Looking over the wallStanding now on the tall north-facing wall of the Tokamak Building, the ITER photographer is able to capture all of the activities going on around the machine well at L3 level. The space in these outlying galleries will be completely filled with equipment and systems.
29 November 2018An unusual angleThe Tokamak Building, seen rising alongside the metal-clad Assembly Hall. On the other side of this north-facing wall is the circular well where the machine will be assembled. European contractors are working to close up the building over the Tokamak Pit in time for heavy assembly works to begin in March 2020.
29 November 2018As the year endsIt was a year of major progress, as the bioshield and the cryostat crown—both strategic structures—were completed. The walls of the Tokamak Complex are rising and, all around, equipment is being moved into the plant system buildings.
29 November 2018LifelinesFeeders will reach the magnets by either crossing through the lower level of the bioshield—passing under the machine—or through the top level, passing over.
27 November 2018First of manyThe feeder array for the ITER magnets is composed of over 100 main components. This one was scheduled for delivery ahead of the others because of its particular shape and its installation configuration at the lower level of the Tokamak Pit.
26 November 2018Through the openingThe magnet feeder component passes through one of the openings of the temporary bioshield lid. This lid will remain in place until the Tokamak Building roof is completed.
26 November 2018The first oneThe cryostat feedthrough begins its 30-metre descent—the first metal component of the ITER machine to enter this space.
26 November 2018Close to home nowA quick halt near the bioshield, up at the top of the Tokamak Complex, as the team organizes the equipment for the final lift.
26 November 2018Up it goesThe 10-metre, 6.6-tonne component (part of a magnet feeder for poloidal field coil #4) is slowly lifted up and over the wall of the Tokamak Complex, to be posed near the top of the ITER bioshield. From there, it will be lowered into the pit.
26 November 2018Operation underwayThe Sun had just set on the ITER worksite when the cryostat feedthrough for poloidal field coil #4—a big, shiny stainless-steel pipe bent at a 90° angle—was slowly lifted from the Hot Cell zone to be deposited on the third level of the Tokamak Building.
26 November 2018Handling frame procured in KoreaIn light grey, a special handling frame that was designed and procured by the Korean Domestic Agency specifically for this operation.
26 November 2018Tests completedThe first metallic component to be installed in the machine pit—a feeder component—had been delivered by China for testing to the Magnet Infrastructure Facilities for ITER (MIFI), next door on the CEA site, one year ago. On 26 November, it was positioned outside of the Tokamak Complex for lifting.
26 November 2018First nuclear door installedThis 60-tonne nuclear door was set into place in November—the first of 46 to be installed at the openings of port cells leading to the Tokamak. All went well, as the dedicated mounting tool successfully transferred the weight of the door to the heavy duty hinges.
15 November 2018SuccessA remote-controlled camera positioned above helped operators to align the door with its hinges exactly. Representatives of the ITER Organization, the European consortium VFR, and sub-contractor Cegelec/Sommer were all present for this first door installation operation15 November 2018Selfies in front of the Tokamak ComplexSome 135 young "doctors in fusion"—PhD students specializing in fusion science and technology in Europe—were on site in November for a three-day event organized by FuseNet and the ITER Organization.

08 November 2018Like a leafThis "leaf mounting tool" has been specially conceived to manoeuvre the nuclear doors that will seal off the 46 individual galleries (port cells) that spoke off from the machine pit. The doors weigh 30 tonnes on delivery, and 30 more after they have been filled with concrete.
20 October 2018Solid framesAt the end of each nine-metre port cell gallery, teams are creating frames to receive heavy nuclear doors. Filled with heavy concrete, the doors will play a role in shielding workers and the environment from fusion-generated radiation.
20 October 201846 port cellsExtending out radially from the concrete bioshield—like so many spokes around a central hub—are nine-metre-long chambers called port cells. The port cells will accommodate heating pipes, electricity cables, diagnostic lines and maintenance systems as they pass through to the vacuum vessel from outlying galleries.
19 October 2018Perfectly planned pointsA vast network of fiducial target nests installed on the concrete surfaces of the bioshield, port cells and galleries will provide the reference datum for the dimensional control and alignment of machine components and plant systems. European contractors are in the process of installing approximately 2,000 of them. Photo: F4E15 October 2018All kinds of shapesSeen from the main ITER office building, the facade of the Tokamak Complex is changing at a fast pace. The column of openings to the left shows where the cask and plug robotic system will move components between the Hot Cell Facility and the port openings at different levels of the machine. The four circular openings will allow the passage of the high voltage transmission lines for the neutral beam systems (diagnostic neutral beam far left, neutral beam heating three on right).
08 October 2018In the driver's seatThe ITER Organization is based in this five-storey, 215-metre-long building in Saint Paul-lez-Durance, France. Through the bridge that connects the building to the construction worksite, machine operators will be able to pass directly on to the Control Room.
08 October 2018BoomtownFrom the C5 crane, we can see a small town booming with activity: to the left, the 60-metre-high Assembly Hall and the circular bioshield ressembling a jewel in its box; to the right, part of the industrial infrastructure (power conversion, cryoplant, electrical switchyard) that will support machine operations.
08 October 2018Intricate webs of rebarThe nuclear concrete structure around the ITER machine will contain 30,000 tonnes of rebar and 150,000 m³ of concrete. The densest, thickest and most intricate rebar arrangements are located under the machine, in the concrete floor (basement), the recently completed crown, and the crown's radial walls.
08 October 2018On the critical pathThe ITER Organization and the seven Domestic Agencies are working to very detailed and closely monitored schedules to reach First Plasma in 2025. Project control metrics show that 57 percent of total First Plasma work scope has been completed (a figure that includes design activities, component manufacturing, building construction, shipping and delivery, assembly and installation). In March 2020 the Tokamak Building will have a roof and the first limited crane access will be possible between the Assembly Hall and the machine assembly pit.
08 October 2018In support ofSome 30 plant systems will be installed to support the machine. On the one-kilometre-long ITER construction platform, infrastructure and buildings rose in 2018 for cryogenics (second from left), magnet power supply (twin buildings in centre), power distribution and heat rejection (not pictured).

16 August 2018Approaching destinationOne of the Tokamak cooling water system drain tanks is transported from temporary storage to the lifting point outside of the Tokamak Complex. One after another, the tanks were lowered through an opening preserved in the ceiling of the drain tank room.
16 August 2018Big doingsIn one of the most spectacular installation activities performed yet in the Tokamak Complex, three drain tanks and four vapour suppression tanks were installed during the week of 14 August—some 600 tonnes of equipment in all.
16 August 2018Standing room onlyOnce a cavernous open space, the drain tank room is now completely filled by the seven tanks. The space above the smallest tank, in the middle, will be taken up by a mezzanine supporting piping, pumps and exchangers for the vacuum vessel's primary heat transfer system.
16 August 2018Skidding on air padsMoving components in the 100-tonne range does not require tremendous force ... provided that the loads are placed on air pads. Once deposited on the floor, each tank (or pair of tanks) was gently drawn into its final position by manually operated cables anchored in the walls.
16 August 2018A pairThe first vapour suppression tank has been deposited and a second is being lowered through the opening in the ceiling. Once paired (one on top of the other) they will be moved to the side to make room for the next delivery.

The tanks will be introduced through the roof.
27 January 2018Last level of bioshieldIn January, the last plot of the bioshield level 4 was poured. The structure rises 30 metres from the basement (B2) level to the top (L4).
19 January 2018Lid to be movedThe temporary "lid" that is currently positioned at mid-height of the bioshield will be raised to the top to act as a roof. (A recess in the concrete shows where the lid will rest.)19 January 2018Neutral beam cell areaThese columns going up in the foreground will support the roof of the neutral beam area. Large bus-sized injectors will be positioned in this space with access to the Tokamak through the round/oval windows visible in this photo.
19 January 2018Soon to be cappedOnce the bioshield has been capped with a temporary lid, work can proceed safely below. One of the upcoming tasks to be carried out is the positioning of "topographic benchmarks" to serve as guides in the installation of the cryostat sections.

Soon, the lid will be repositioned at the top of the structure and workers will have unrestricted access to the entire volume of the Tokamak Pit.
12 January 2018The flying buttresses of ITERRadial walls will permit the machine's support structure to transfer some of the "force" experienced during machine operation to the bioshield wall and Tokamak Building basemat.
12 January 2018Starting on the crownIn the bottom of the Tokamak Pit, a concrete crown will support the base of the cryostat. After realizing a full-size mockup to validate constructability, workers are now carrying out the first steps.
12 January 2018Crown and radial walls underwayOne of the most strategic parts of ITER construction, the crown and radial walls necessitate the densest, thickest and most intricate rebar arrangements of the entire installation. This machine support structure should be finalized by the end of the summer.
12 January 2018Helping to distribute the loadsWorkers are busy installing the steel reinforcement for each radial wall: thick rebar (up to 50 millimetres in diameter) arranged in a complex geometry, and massive steel transition pieces (3 tonnes each) that will transfer and distribute the loads to the concrete civil work.

07 November 2017Visitors on a SaturdayDuring the ITER Open Doors Day on 21 October visitors were invited to walk out into the centre of the bioshield, where European Domestic Agency contractors were on hand to give explanations.
21 October 2017A table full of building materialsAs part of explanations, visitors were shown the different elements used in Tokamak Complex construction ... including some of the thickest rebar on the market.
21 October 2017Through the magic doorVisitors entered the bioshield through an opening that will accommodate one of the neutral beam injectors, used to heat the plasma.
21 October 2017Non-random constellationsEach one of the embedded plates in the basement of the Diagnostics Building has been placed with care and its final position measured through laser techniques. Position will be important when it comes to attaching the systems and components planned for this level.
17 October 2017FUSION!A reminder, in yellow, of what everyone on site is working for: FUSION!17 October 2017A peculiar openingMost openings in the bioshield are perfect squares (4 m x 4 m). This one and three others, however, stand out due to their peculiar oval or round shapes—a distinctive sign that signals them out as the openings for the ITER neutral beam injectors.
17 October 2017Like a giant bird's nestConcrete pouring is about to begin on the third above-ground level of the ITER bioshield (L3).
08 October 2017Pouring the "mega" columnsEighteen massive columns will provide structural support to the different levels of the Tokamak Complex; six among them will have the additional role of supporting the assembly crane rails. At the L2 level of the Tokamak Building, concrete is being poured into one of these "mega columns."08 October 2017In the heart of Haute-ProvenceScrubland and forest, rounded hills and perched villages, the Alps half-masked by a blue haze ... the landscape that extends beyond the ITER site is typical of Haute-Provence.

The mockup reproduces 1/18th of the support system. Photo: F4E15 February 2015That's crowded!The dense reinforcement of the ITER crown (a thick, circular concrete structure connected to the three-metre-thick bioshield by radial concrete walls) is illustrated in the real-size mockup currently under construction on the platform. Photo : F4E15 February 2015Flurries in FebruaryIn the 80 x 120 metre Tokamak Pit, where scaffolding is up for the first basement-level walls, a few flurries in February complicated works.
12 February 2015Basement-level wallsThe first B2-level wall is now in place on the Diagnostic Building side of the basemat. A gap of approximately 2 metres will separate the Tokamak Complex from the retaining walls; this gap will permit the Complex to move on its seismic pads as one block in the case of earthquake.
16 January 2015The first wall of the Tokamak ComplexIn January, workers complete the first wall of the Diagnostics Building, on the south side of the Tokamak Complex.
16 January 2015Wall pouring continuesThree wall sections have been poured for the basement level walls of the Tokamak Complex. The formwork panels used to frame out the sections are assembled by fours before being transported by crane to the work area.
19 December 2014Ready, set ...
Everything's ready for tomorrow's first pour in one corner of the Tokamak Complex Seismic Pit. Photo: F4E18 December 2014Long arms neededPouring activities for the first basement-level walls of the Tokamak Complex are taking place approximately 12 metres below the level of the platform. Photo: F4E29 November 2014First two wallsThe first walls of the Tokamak Complex are going up in the southern corners of the Seismic Pit, at left (completed) and at right (underway). Photo: F4E29 November 2014In the basement of the Tokamak ComplexThe Tokamak Complex will be a seven-storey structure: two basement levels and five storeys. On 20 November 2014, pouring began for basement level B2.
20 November 2014Level B2Work on the first level walls of the Tokamak Complex (basement level B2) is expected to last until mid-2015.
20 November 2014Walls: the first pourConcrete pouring for the first wall of the Diagnostics Building takes place on 20 November.
20 November 2014Where the work is startingThe ITER Tokamak Complex Seismic Pit: 120 metres long, 80 metres wide.
18 November 2014Prepared for heavy loadsA third crane is now in place in the centre of the basemat. Five tall cranes—one on every corner and one in the centre—will soon be in place for the construction of the Tokamak Complex.
28 October 2014First walls in NovemberScaffolding, reinforcement bars - everything is ready for the first Tokamak Complex walls to be poured in November.
28 October 2014Looking upAt its final height, the Tokamak Complex will be nearly as tall as the crane at left—60 metres above platform level.
28 October 2014GiantsThree of the five cranes planned for Tokamak Complex construction activities will rise over 75 metres (76 m, 80 m and 82 m) and have lifting capacities of 6-8 tons at the tip of their 55- to 65-metre-long booms.
27 October 2014A new phase for ITERFormwork is positioned for the first walls of the Diagnostics Building. The beginning of wall construction marks a new phase in ITER construction: the four-year drive to build the Tokamak Complex and eight other buildings. Photo: Engage20 October 2014Propping and formwork in OctoberPropping work has begun on the south end of the Seismic Pit. In November, the first walls will be poured for the Diagnostics Building. Photo: Engage20 October 2014Tall cranes going upIn one corner of the Seismic Pit, a tower crane is going up to prepare for the next phase of work: the pouring of the B2 slab that will act as a floor to the three buildings of the Tokamak Complex.
01 October 2014A home for the TokamakThe 23,000-tonne ITER Tokamak will have a seven-storey home. Machine assembly will begin two levels underground.
The ITER Tokamak ComplexSeven storeys tall—including two basement levels—the ITER Tokamak Complex is in fact three buildings: the Tokamak Building (centre), the Tritium Building (left) and the Diagnostics Building (right). Construction began in October 2014.
Filling penetrationsOne of the last construction activities is to seal the openings (or penetrations) in the walls. The penetrations must be filled while letting equipment pass. © Les Nouveaux Médias/SNC ENGAGEClick for full screen2021202020192018201720162015201420132012' + currentmenu.text() + 'ConstructionThe Tokamak ComplexFOR THE PUBLICFOR THE PRESSFOR SCIENTISTSFOR INDUSTRYINTRANETITER Assembly Live Event - 28 JULYThe event will be live-streamed, in three parts (all times listed are French local times):10:00 a.m. — Tour of the ITER worksite and large components on site11:00 a.m. — Ceremony, including statements by world leaders12:30 a.m. (or following the ceremony) — Press conference
