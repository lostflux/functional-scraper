AdvertisementA tree of Indo-African mantle plumes imaged by seismic tomographyNature Geosciencevolume14,pages612–619 (2021)Cite this article3197Accesses4Citations182AltmetricMetricsdetailsSubjectsAbstractMantle plumes were conceived as thin, vertical conduits in which buoyant, hot rock from the lowermost mantle rises to Earth’s surface, manifesting as hotspot-type volcanism far from plate boundaries. Spatially correlated with hotspots are two vast provinces of slow seismic wave propagation in the lowermost mantle, probably representing the heat reservoirs that feed plumes. Imaging plume conduits has proved difficult because most are located beneath the non-instrumented oceans, and they may be thin. Here we combine new seismological datasets to resolve mantle upwelling across all depths and length scales, centred on Africa and the Indian and Southern oceans. Using seismic waves that sample the deepest mantle extensively, we show that mantle upwellings are arranged in a tree-like structure. From a central, compact trunk below ~1,500 km depth, three branches tilt outwards and up towards various Indo-Austral hotspots. We propose that each tilting branch represents an alignment of vertically rising blobs or proto-plumes, which detached in a linear staggered sequence from their underlying low-velocity corridor at the core–mantle boundary. Once a blob reaches the viscosity discontinuity between lower and upper mantle, it spawns a ‘classical’ plume-head/plume-tail sequence.

MainConvection plumes are expected to rise from the core–mantle boundary (CMB) because core heat diffuses into lowermost mantle rock, which becomes buoyant1. The plumes’ geoscientific importance derives from the amount of core heat these focused streams bring to the surface or near surface. From the geometries of hotspot tracks and swells, plumes should be only 100–200 km wide and account for at most 10% of geothermal heat loss2,3. However, the plume’s presumed feeder zones in the lowermost mantle are much broader and more voluminous. The ‘superswells’ or ‘large low-velocity provinces’4,5(LLVPs) sprawl across ~30% of CMB area5and rise 500–1,000 km above it. Numerous 500- to 1,000-km-thick plumes observed in the lower mantle6,7,8could also point to more rising heat than admitted by the surface tallies based on narrow hotspot tracks2,3.
The LLVPs are thought to be chemically denser than ambient mantle, containing subducted crust or chemically distinct rock assemblages dating from Earth’s earliest history5,9. With sufficient heating from the core, such LLVP rock may start to rise buoyantly, but depending on the amount of cooling during ascent10, much of it may lose its positive buoyancy mid-way and never get close to the surface. A priori reasonable ranges for mantle viscosities and density anomalies, ‘height’ of the denser layer and core versus internal heating admit a wide variety of convective plume patterns5,9,10. Narrowing this parameter space depends on seismic tomographic images that confidently constrain the spatial scales and the connectivity of upwellings. Since modelled plumes have a strong tendency to rise vertically from the CMB to the surface10,11,12, tomographic illumination across all mantle depths is particularly useful in providing a set of self-consistent geometric constraints that mantle modelling should reproduce. This is the aim of our study.
The Réunion Hotspot and Upper Mantle–Réunions Unterer Mantel experimentAmong the most plausible locations for whole-mantle plumes13, almost all are located in the oceans, where high imaging resolution in the upper and lower mantle can be achieved only by instrumenting large areas of kilometre-deep seafloor14,15,16or the water column17. Only a few hotspots14,15,16have been instrumented due to the challenges of ship access and sensor technologies. The largest such experiment, in terms of spatial footprint and instruments operating simultaneously, has been the Réunion Hotspot and Upper Mantle–Réunions Unterer Mantel (RHUM–RUM) experiment18. It covered 2,000 × 2,000 km2of western Indian Ocean with 57 broadband ocean-bottom seismometers (OBSs) for 13 months, complemented by 37 island stations (Fig.
1). In first using RHUM–RUM body-wave data for tomography, our hemispheric-scale study is able to trace at least one upwelling from the African LLVP to its surface location in high detail.
Red dots represent broadband OBSs (October 2012–November 2013). Pink diamonds represent broadband land seismometers (2011–2016). Yellow circles and cyan hexagons represent broadband stations of partner projects SELASOMA52and MACOMO53, respectively.

1. R, La Réunion Island; M, Mauritius; SWIR, Southwest Indian Ridge.
La Réunion Island features the primary attributes of a classical, deep hotspot13. Among Earth’s most active volcanoes, it is located ~1,000 km from the nearest plate boundary, with long-lived, stationary volcanism and the enriched and noble gas geochemistry characteristic of hotspots. A time-progressive, 5,500-km-long volcanic track leads to the Deccan Traps in India, which erupted more than 106km3of flood basalts around 65 Ma13,19,20.
P-wave tomography from surface to coreOur tomography samples the entire mantle column by jointly inverting three types of P-wave observations. The first dataset of travel-time picks from the International Seismological Centre (ISC)–Engdahl, van der Hilst and Buland (EHB)21,22catalogue yields a conventional global P-wave model illuminating mainly the mid-mantle. The second, methodically new dataset of core-diffracted P waves (Pdiff) constrains the lowermost mantle globally23. A third new dataset of 55,657 teleseismic multi-frequency travel times, measured on the dense RHUM–RUM array18, resolves the upper half of the mantle under the oceanic Réunion hotspot. The respective contributions of the three datasets are illustrated by Fig.
2and detailed in theMethods. Seismic velocity anomalies are caused primarily by mantle temperature variations, with slower-than-average regions probably hot and therefore buoyant24.

The teleseismic model in Fig.
2a,bshows a voluminous body of slow P velocities resides in the lower mantle beneath southern Africa—the African LLVP with its sharp western edge, tilting eastward towards the surface6,25. The upper mantle is slow beneath the Réunion hotspot and Madagascar. The three-dimensional (3D) hulls in Fig.
2bemphasize the smoothness of this conventional global tomography, characteristically lacking upper-mantle detail beneath the hotspot because seismic stations in the region were limited to a few widely spaced island locations.
The base of the mantle is constrained only marginally by existing P-wave tomographies7,26, but it is sampled extensively by our Pdiffwaveform measurements. Figure2c,dshows the effect of adding these data. The lower mantle becomes slower and more structured than in Fig.
2a,b. On the CMB, a narrow, slow corridor extends southeastwards from the LLVP’s main doming, towards the viewer in Fig.
2c, rising 500–900 km above the CMB. We term this the Southern Indian Ocean (SIO) corridor.
The model resulting from the joint inversion of all three datasets, including RHUM–RUM, is named RROx-19 (Fig.
2e,f). Slow-velocity anomalies at all depths are further intensified and concentrated spatially, compared not just with Fig.
2a–dbut also with published models (Extended Data Fig.
1). Crucially, the eastward-tilting mid-mantle structure sharpens into an alignment of distinctive blobs, each 700–800 km in diameter, which are robust in numerous resolution tests (Methods). Beneath the area instrumented by RHUM–RUM, the upper mantle acquires the expected layering of fast lithosphere underlain by slow asthenosphere and reveals small-scale, lateral subdivisions. The upwellings have a strongly 3D character.
Figure3is an annotated zoom into the preferred joint inversion of Fig.
2f, additionally showing a northeast–southwest cross section through Afar and Bouvet hotspots and the East African Rift region. Beneath Réunion, a 200-km thin vertical conduit appears in the upper mantle (right dashed arrow in Fig.
2f) and is robustly resolved (Extended Data Fig.
2). The conduit is anchored in a slow blob (marked by a bullseye), the distal part of the 700- to 800-km-thick mid-branch that tilts up eastwards from the LLVP cusp. If a vertical slow conduit beneath Réunion continued below 1,000 km, it would be much thinner than this tilting structure because resolution in this entire vertical column is excellent according to the resolution tests (Supplementary Figs.
4and5). Despite its disrupted downward connection, the hotspot sits vertically above slow lowermost mantle, on the SIO corridor’s northern flank (Extended Data Fig.
3).

2f. Long-dashed purple line marks the top of the LLVP. The bullseye and cross mark the areas where Kerguelen and East African mid-mantle branches emerge out of and into the viewing plane. Structure outside the grey dashed lines is not 3D rendered for better visibility of the main features; the same is true for the grey area between points 3 and 4, which contains a smearing artefact emerging out of plane.
b, An analogous cross section through the Bouvet mid-mantle branch, the LLVP cusp (purple dashed line), the East Africa mid-mantle branch and Afar hotspot (vertical line).
Another vertical, upper-mantle conduit sits beneath southernmost Madagascar (Fig.
3; ~100 km in diameter, left dashed arrow) and is well resolved (Extended Data Fig.
2). This conduit could relate to the unexplained, late Cenozoic onset of volcanism on Madagascar27, present-day low velocities in the Madagascan asthenosphere28and 1–2 km of dynamically supported uplift since 15 Ma29. However, no time-progressive volcanic track is known, and the geochemistry of central Madagascan volcanism requires no substantial excess temperatures30. Farther west, LLVP-connected anomalies extend to asthenospheric depths of ~250 km but appear contained beneath old Jurassic lithosphere of the Mozambique Channel31.
Under the Central Indian Ridge, the uppermost mantle is slow (Fig.
2e), as expected for active spreading31,32. The westward-down extension towards the mid-mantle blob is probably a smearing artefact due to lack of instrumentation because surface-wave tomography confirms slow velocities beneath the ridge to be limited to the upper 100 km31,32.
Structural elements of the LLVPThe 3D connectivity of slow structure (presumably upwellings) is rendered in Fig.
4, centred on southern Africa. Figure4arenders all low-velocity anomalies between 1,000 and 2,900 km (colour codes for depth); Fig.

The lowermost mantle (2,900–2,400 km, Fig.
4b) features a single, hemisphere-spanning structure, the African LLVP. It consists of a broadened central part under southern Africa, where three narrowly elongated corridors converge. The longest is the SIO corridor (~7000 km long, ~800 km wide on the CMB). The Kerguelen hotspot sits above its distal end, and Réunion and Marion hotspots near its northern and southern flanks, respectively. The East African (EA) corridor extends northwards under Kenya, atop which the Afar hotspot was sitting ~30 Ma33,34when its flood basalts erupted35. (Africa has drifted north since.) A third, shorter corridor is incident from the west (South Atlantic). These CMB corridors are discernible in some previous global tomographies (Extended Data Fig.
4) but are rendered more narrowly elongated by our Pdiffdata, hence more distinct from the LLVP’s central region under South Africa.
Between 2,300 and 1,900 km (Fig.
4c), slow velocities fade above the corridors and gather in a narrow dome under South Africa, forming the LLVP’s cusp (Fig.
3, dashed purple line). A smaller dome is present beneath the Kerguelen area. At 1,600–1,300 km depth (Fig.
4d), the Kerguelen dome has faded, and the central dome has split into three diverging branches, one running southeast (above the SIO CMB corridor), another running north (above the EA corridor), and the third running southwest towards the Bouvet hotspot.
The three branches continue to diverge and rise between 1,100 and 900 km depth (Fig.
4e). South of Madagascar, the SIO splits into two sub-branches running towards Réunion and Kerguelen.
From deep to shallow levels, slow anomalies become increasingly small scale and scattered. In composite Fig.
4a, slow anomalies are notably absent above the LLVP’s central cusp, instead clustering above the red-brown SIO and EA corridors. Into the upper mantle, we lose resolution outside instrumented areas, but the general increase in structural complexity is real (further confirmed by Supplementary Fig.
4a,b, above 800 km) and presumably reflects the lower viscosities of the upper mantle36.
The key observation of Fig.
4a, of the two major tilting branches (EA, SIO) vertically overlying the two major LLVP corridors, means that the essence of 3D structure can be captured by the 2D sections of Fig.
3and cartoon Fig.
4f. Figure3bslices through the EA and Bouvet mid-mantle branches, the former rising from the LLVP cusp northwards, toward Malawi and Kenya, further connecting to Afar through anomalously slow upper mantle.
The mid-mantle branch towards Bouvet rises southwestwards from the cusp, similar to the SIO and EA branches in overall appearance, though less well resolved (Supplementary Fig.
2). A slow CMB corridor underlying the Bouvet branch is currently not resolvable (see targeted test, Extended Data Fig.
5) but may be present because most global models in Extended Data Fig.
4show the resolvable vestiges expected for the case that a corridor were present.
The tilting East African Rift branch was well known6,37, and the tilting SIO branch is discernible in global tomographies (Extended Data Fig.
1). The Bouvet branch is newly resolved, as is the emergence of all three branches from one specific area and depth under the southern Mozambique Channel (the cusp), which thus becomes recognizable as the upper limit of the LLVP.
A family tree of Indo-African plumesNone of the existing models for LLVP–plume interaction5anticipated or explain the observed, multiple occurrences of tilting mid-mantle branches, vertically underlain by slow CMB corridors. Three instances of this structural element converge under southern Africa, giving the LLVP a tree-like appearance (Fig.
4f). Narrow, root-like CMB corridors converge on a central doming region (the trunk). Three branches split off at the top of this trunk (~1,500 km depth), diverging upwards and further splitting into a canopy of splotchy, small-scale structure above 1,000 km.
Figure5proposes a new model for how the African LLVP generates plumes and hotspot volcanism. It accounts for our seismic observations and hindcasts the spatiotemporal patterns of plume-head eruptions in detail (large igneous provinces, LIPs). Each mid-mantle branch consists of several blobs or proto-plumes (~800 km in diameter, Fig.
3a), which rose vertically from the CMB corridor underneath. The blobs are diagonally aligned because they detached in temporally staggered sequence (not because plume material flows diagonally up within the branch).
a, A proto-plume, 1, ~800 km in diameter, develops at the distal end of an LLVP corridor, a region of maximum dT/dx.
b, 1 detaches and rises vertically. The next instability, 2, develops left of 1, in the new instantaneous region of maximum dT/dx.
c, Continued vertical rise of 1 and 2 and incipient detachment of 3 in the adjacent, new region of maximum dT/dx.
d, Present-day snapshot shows tilted alignment of rising proto-plume blobs and a thinned low-velocity corridor left behind on the CMB. On reaching the viscosity boundary between lower and upper mantle, proto-plume 1 spawns the ‘classical’ sequence of a short-lived plume head (LIP), followed by one or more thin, long-lived plume tails, which remain rooted in their mid-mantle blob. Arrival of the plume head dynamically uplifted the lithosphere54(vertically exaggerated). Proto-plume 1 corresponds with the Réunion plume in Fig.
3(top) and Fig.
4f; 3 corresponds with the LLVP cusp.
Blob 1 detaches from the distal end of the CMB corridor (Fig.
5a). This promontory region is characterized by strong lateral temperature gradients (dT/dx) to its non-LLVP surroundings in three directions (to the right, and in/out of the viewing plane). Settings of strong dT/dxare known to be preferential formation regions for thermal instabilities38,39. The upward release of Blob 1 shifts the location of maximum dT/dxleft along the corridor (Fig.
5b), where the next instability is generated (Blob 2). Departure of Blob 2 causes instability 3 to its left, and so on. Thus, a self-triggering cascade of blob-shaped detachments propagates along a hot CMB corridor, towards the centre of the LLVP. Upon reaching the boundary to the upper mantle with its drop in ambient viscosity, each proto-plume blob spawns a plume-head/plume-tail sequence (Fig.
5d). This explains why the thin plume-tail conduit under present-day Réunion is anchored in a mid-mantle blob rather than the CMB.
Tank and numerical models show a strong tendency for plume material to rise vertically9,10,12; notable tilts are produced only when plume detachment regions sweep laterally across the CMB over time12, as in Fig.
5. Moreover, diagonal upwards flow in the branches would not require or explain CMB corridors vertically underneath. Compared with earlier S-wave models, our Pdiffobservations narrow the CMB corridors to <1,000 km, no wider than the detaching blobs—a line-like LLVP geometry removes or supersedes the debate of whether plumes rise from the centre versus the interior of the LLVP4,40.
Our model hindcasts a linearly staggered sequence of plume-head arrivals at the surface (LIP eruptions), which are indeed observed for the EA and SIO branches. Located distally above the EA corridor, the Afar region experienced flood basalt eruptions ~30 Ma, followed by transition from continental rifting to seafloor spreading. Continental rifting is increasingly recent and less advanced towards the southern EA rift35, and the associated magmatism does not (yet) have LIP character, although slow-velocity anomalies are already flooding the upper mantle (Extended Data Fig.
6). As predicted, no rifting is observed south of Malawi/Mozambique, where the tilting Afar branch is still at mid-mantle depths.
Similarly, the Kerguelen flood basalts occurred ~120 Ma19,41,42above the distal SIO corridor and moved inwards to Marion ~90 Ma19,41,42(Madagascar Rise LIP) and to Réunion ~65 Ma (Deccan Traps LIP)13,19,41, but no flood basalts have occurred closer to the cusp, where the upwelling SIO branch is still at mid-mantle depths. The three LIP arrivals above the SIO corridor are thought to have created the Indian Ocean as they unzipped India from its Gondwana supercontinent surroundings, in the sequence India from Antarctica19,41,42~120 Ma (Kerguelen); India from Madagascar19,41,43~90 Ma (Marion); and India from Seychelles19,41,42~65 Ma (La Réunion). Similarly, the plume heat emanating from the EA corridor may be enabling the splitting of Africa, potentially creating a new ocean basin35. Thus, SIO and EA corridor geometries foreshadowed the strikes of major future spreading systems. The linear staggering of proto-plume detachments (Fig.
5) explains the effectiveness of flood basalts in unzipping continents and creating new spreading ridges19,41,44(compared with randomly sequenced LIP arrivals).
This newly predictable sequencing of LIPs informs the question of whether flood basalts precede continental rifting or vice versa45,46. Under Kenya, for example, a future LIP seems to be rising, but rifting and hot asthenosphere inflow may have long been encroaching from the north (Afar). Thus, Kenyan rifting precedes its LIP but is driven (or facilitated) by the adjacent, preceding LIP within the EA corridor sequence.
We predict cataclysmic flood basalts, some tens of millions of years in the future, for the surface overlying the LLVP cusp, where three inward-sweeping mid-mantle branches converge—possibly analogous to widespread, Cretaceous plateau eruptions above the Pacific LLVP4,14,19,47,48. Upwelling of the cusp probably already shapes the large-scale topography anomaly of southern Africa, which stands 500–1,000 m higher than expected49.
Our model of blobby proto-plumes (Fig.
5) predicts a Réunion-like situation under every active hotspot of the region: a classical, thin and vertical plume conduit, but only down to ~700 km depth. There it is anchored in a mid-mantle blob without a tail to the CMB (for example, ref.
11). Currently resolved structure under Afar6,37, Bouvet (Extended Data Fig.
6) and Kerguelen is consistent with this prediction. Hence, the observed, near-stationarity of Indo-Atlantic hotspots (relative motions of <10 mm yr–1), long harnessed for constructing absolute reference frames19,33, may measure the advection of mid-mantle reservoirs at 700–1,500 km depth rather than in the lowermost mantle.
The thin, upper-mantle conduits under Réunion and Madagascar may represent mostly thermal plumes released from the proto-plume, whose denser components tend to stay behind in the broad mid-mantle blob (Fig.
5d). Tailless blobs of large diameters (700–800 km under Réunion) point towards a dense chemical component in the LLVP and in the proto-plumes10. Dense blobs need to become hotter to rise, perhaps partly explaining their robust tomographic visibility. Purely thermal plumes require smaller excess temperatures to rise, should be thin and should retain their stems to the CMB10.
The hotspots that form the branches of the southern African LLVP tree essentially coincide with the ensemble of hotspots defining the geochemical DUPAL anomaly50,51, which distinguishes hotspot basalts of the Indo-Southern Ocean from others around the world. Hence, the source region of the DUPAL anomaly may be identified with the LLVP tree structure below its branching depth of ~1,500 km. Indian and Southern Ocean hotspot eruptions that were previously not known to be specifically related beyond their shared DUPAL signature are aligned into predictable spatiotemporal sequences by our observation of narrow LLVP corridors paired with vertically detached upwellings in the mid- and upper mantle. This inference has been enabled by the very detailed imaging, from lithosphere to core, of one complete ‘unzipping corridor’ under the SIO, including one of its currently active hotspots (La Réunion), and by much-improved resolution of the southern African LLVP. Surface relationships to geologically datable events (flood basalts, continental rift progression, dynamic topography, geochemistry) open new paths for investigating the dynamics of plumes, their source regions and their role in continental uplift and rifting.
MethodsRHUM–RUMThe RHUM–RUM experiment instrumented 2,000 × 2,000 km of the western Indian Ocean (Fig.
1). Its central component was a 13-month deployment of 57 German and French broadband OBSs in 2,300- to 5,600-m-deep water, supplemented by 2–3 yearlong deployments of 37 island stations on La Réunion, Mauritius, Rodrigues, the southern Seychelles, the Iles Eparses and southern Madagascar. Two complementary partner projects across Madagascar53and Mozambique52extended the deployment westwards with another 33 stations. Combined with a cluster of OBSs that stretched eastwards to the Central Indian Ridge, the overall array was elongated in an east–west direction, making optimal use of crossing wave paths from the two most prolific incidence directions of teleseismic earthquakes: the southwest Pacific subduction zones to the east and the South Sandwich subduction to the west. A line of distant southerly OBSs recorded seismicity from the Alpine–Himalayan mountain belts, and Seychelles stations recorded sparser events from the south.
Pre-processingThe RHUM–RUM dataset55has been assigned the FDSN network code YV and is freely accessible at the French RESIF data centre (http://seismology.resif.fr). Large volumes of seismic waveforms were retrieved and pre-processed using obspyDMT56, a program that automatically applies instrument correction and filters and cuts the waveforms around possible earthquakes according to a selected earthquake catalogue. A general description and quality assessment of the waveforms recorded by OBS stations was presented by Stähler et al.
57; the main challenge in working with the ocean-bottom data was ambient (microseismic) noise and high self-noise (only in the German DEPAS stations).
Dataset 3: teleseismic, multi-frequency measurements on Indian Ocean stationsWe followed the approach of Sigloch and Nolet58, briefly outlined in the following. Observed broadband waveforms from RHUM–RUM OBS, island stations and other land stations were Gabor-filtered in eight frequency passbands between 30 and 2.7 s centre period. To measure travel-time delays, these observations were cross correlated with bandpassed synthetic waveforms23,58(not with neighbouring observed seismograms), yielding travel-time delays relative to spherically symmetric Earth model IASP91. A measurement was accepted for input to the tomography if the Pearson cross-correlation coefficient exceeded 0.8. This procedure yielded the 55,657 teleseismic P-wave travel times in the eight frequency passbands, from 25,130 unique source-receiver paths, generated by 635 earthquakes that occurred 2011–2016 (Supplementary Fig.
1). Multi-frequency measurements enable selectively rejecting data in noisy frequency bands, while often retaining at least one acceptable band per wave path. Since OBS seismograms are more affected by microseismic noise than are land stations, the method salvages a maximum of wave paths for these expensive and valuable measurements.
Synthetic waveforms are calculated as the convolution of a (broadband) Green’s function with a (broadband) source time function (STF), which are subsequently Gabor-filtered to the same passbands as the observations. Fully numerical Green’s functions are calculated in the broadband range of 0.2 MHz to 1 Hz, using the axisymmetric spectral element method AxiSEM59(via its look-up database Instaseis60). We propagated waves through the spherically symmetric Earth model IASP9161with density and attenuation taken from PREM62.
For each of the 635 earthquakes, a broadband STF is estimated (jointly deconvolved) from a suitable, spatially evenly distributed subset of broadband seismograms recorded for the event in question and from their broadband synthetics. For STF deconvolution, we use all stations at teleseismic distances that are part of the permanent, international networks (network codes II, IU, G or GE), but no RHUM–RUM stations or other temporary, regionally clustered networks. The computation of STFs is required for making correlation measurements because our study is almost global in scale. We cannot calculate finite-frequency travel times by correlating data with data (as in regional studies) because the waveforms may look too different to correlate well (due to the effects of radiation pattern and depth phases pP and sP). We have to correlate data with synthetics, and our frequencies are so high, and most events so shallow (depth phases pP and sP spaced by only a few seconds), that approximating the STF as Dirac pulse does not yield satisfactory correlations. STF shape is also used as a quality check; that is, events are not used for subsequent travel-time measurements when their STF estimates look non-physical23(see Sigloch and Nolet58for details).
Dataset 2: multi-frequency travel-time measurements of PdiffThese deepest-diving body waves are abundantly observed on broadband seismograms, but they have hardly been used in tomography63,64because computational modelling of their diffraction by Earth’s core is challenging. In a decade-long method-development effort, we have measured multi-frequency cross-correlation travel times on broadband, core-diffracted P waveform23,65, modelled by the full-waveform propagation method AxiSEM59. Figure2c,dillustrates the benefits of jointly inverting Pdifftravel times with the teleseismic ISC–EHB picks. Pdiffwaves dive so deep that they sense Earth’s core and are diffracted around it. Their abundance and relatively short wavelengths make them the most highly resolving wave type that extensively samples the lower third of the mantle. These longest-distance P waves (epicentral distances of ~97° or greater) have been made usable for tomography by Hosseini and Sigloch65and Hosseini et al.
23. This study uses a regionally optimized subset of 189,439 cross-correlation measurements of Pdifftravel times in five frequency bands (periods 30 to 7.5 s), taken from the global dataset of ~1,400,000 travel times inverted by Hosseini et al.
23. Full-waveform synthetics were calculated using the AxiSEM59software, as for dataset 3.
Dataset 1: teleseismic ISC–EHB travel-time picksThe backbone dataset of over 2 million analyst-picked, teleseismic P-wave arrivals, was chosen because these data have been recorded around the sparsely instrumented Indian Ocean for three decades longer than modern broadband networks. To maximize the data coverage in the mid- and upper mantle beneath the western Indian Ocean, and to embed our new multi-frequency measurements in a global context, we complemented the inversion by a subset of analyst-picked P-wave arrival times from the EHB21catalogue (picks reported between 1970 and 1999) and from the new ISC–EHB22catalogue (2000–2014). Our aim was to select the smallest useful subset of teleseismic P-wave picks that would fill as many gaps as possible in our multi-frequency data coverage. We considered P-wave arrival picks at epicentral distances 30°–90° if the precision of their arrival-time reading was better (smaller) than 0.1 s. We also used the method of Hosseini et al.
23to homogenize the directional density coverage of measurements at source-receiver locations. The final selection includes 2,342,621 teleseismic P-wave phase picks.
TomographyAll P-wave travel times were corrected for crustal structure, topography and ellipticity. We correct for crustal structure using the model CRUST2.066in a ray-theoretical framework67, that is, not accounting for frequency dependence68. Finite-frequency sensitivity kernels were computed for the Pdifftravel times (as in ref.
23) and for the teleseismic RHUM–RUM travel times (following the method of Dahlen et al.
69). The ISC data were modelled with ray-like sensitivities. Each sensitivity kernel is numerically integrated on the tetrahedral inversion grid23,70,71. The earthquakes were relocated during the inversion stage. A combination of norm damping and Laplacian smoothing operators was used to regularize the ill-posed linear system of equations. By changing the intensity of the two regularization parameters, the trade-off between residual data misfit ||Gm–d||2(whereGis the matrix containing the sensitivity kernels discretized over our modelm, anddis the data vector containing the travel-time measurements) in terms of\(\chi _{{\mathrm{red}}}^2\)(absoluteχ2divided by the number of dataN) can be written as:and the model norm ||m||2can be analysed. In this equation,diobsis the observed travel time,dipredis the predicted travel time andσis the a priori uncertainty assigned to each measurement according to the cross-correlation coefficientxc. The values ofxctranslated to assigned measurement uncertaintiesσas follows: 0.8 ≤xc<0.85 toσ= 1.0 s; 0.85 ≤xc<0.90 toσ= 0.6 s; 0.90 ≤xc<0.95 toσ= 0.4 s; 0.95 ≤xc<1.0 toσ= 0.3 s. All ISC measurements are assigned an uncertainty ofσ= 1.0 s.
EachLcurve is derived by assuming a constant ratio of the\(\frac{{{\mathrm{damping}}}}{{{\mathrm{smoothing}}}}\)parameters but with different absolute amplitudes.
\(\chi _{{\mathrm{red}}}^2 = 1\)is the optimal value to target if allσare perfectly known. In practice, imperfect knowledge about the measurement uncertainties means some experimentation and subjective model appraisal in a relatively narrow range around this theoretically optimalχ2value (usually models close to the bending of theLcurve). Our preferred model hasχ2= 1.02.
The resulting tomography models can be examined in Fig.
2. In the ISC-only model (Fig.
2a), the uppermost mantle between the Madagascar and the Réunion areas is laterally uniformly red (slow) and lacks any vertical layering. The shallow, fast (blue) blob just west of Réunion in Fig.
2c(versus Fig.
2a) is introduced by paths incident on the Réunion station ‘RER’ from core-diffracted distances from the west (various azimuths, Andean earthquakes and Mid-Atlantic Ridge). By contrast, western paths from teleseismic distances in Fig.
2aare essentially limited to the South Sandwich arc. These teleseismic observations are evidently not sufficiently numerous and/or not sufficiently localizable along their ray paths to ‘override’ the tomography’s smoothing constraint, which acts to blur the red anomalies to either side of the blue anomaly (Fig.
2c) into a single, laterally extended red anomaly in Fig.
2a. All of these structures in the ISC-only and in the ISC + Pdiffmodels are essentially constrained by only one station on Réunion, one on Mauritius, and one or two on Madagascar. In Fig.
2e, the RHUM–RUM data confirm and intensify the intervening blue anomaly. In addition, the laterally extended RHUM–RUM network introduces a vertical layering of lithosphere, asthenosphere and transition zone in the upper mantle under this region.
The three tomography models compared in Fig.
2are chosen such that they feature most nearly the same globalχ2misfit statistics (of close to 1.0 for the global dataset and ~1.4 for data recorded in the Indian Ocean and Africa). The data fit for the ISC data does not deteriorate when the Pdiffdata get introduced in addition (transition from Fig.
2a,bto Fig.
2c,d), and the fits of ISC and Pdiffdatasets do not deteriorate when the RHUM–RUM data get introduced (transition from model Fig.
2c,dto Fig.
2e,f). This combined model fits all three datasets without conflicts or trade-offs.
VisualizationAll 3D visualizations (Figs.
2,3and4) were done using ParaView72(http://www.paraview.org), an open-source data analysis and visualization application. Low velocities are rendered at several isovalues (dVp/Vp= –0.25%, –0.5%, –1%, –2% and –3%); this leads to a 3D rendered effect, where seismically slow structures are enclosed by the nested isosurfaces. In Figs.
2and3, the corresponding, nested cylindrical colour bar clarifies this visualization concept. Each cylinder represents one velocity isovalue, several of which are stacked into each other. Cut obliquely, we can identify the different cylinders and their isovalues (darker red means slower dV/V). The same idea of nested hypersurfaces applies when assessing the tomographic model.
Figures that present nested isosurfaces in thick cross-sectional slices always render volumes that are ring shaped (segments of a great circle) and 1,000 km wide; that is, the rendered region extends 500 km towards the viewer and 500 km away from the viewer, with a conventional, 2D, red-blue cross section forming the dividing plane. In addition to this, Figs.
2and3render nested isosurfaces within 500 km of the CMB.
The published tomographic models used for comparison in Extended Data Figs.
1,3and5were downloaded from our free SubMachine73web portal and visualized with ParaView using the same techniques.
Comparison with other tomographic modelsExtended Data Figs.
1,3and5compare our model RROx-19 with nine other global tomography models (from top to bottom and left to right): DETOX-P323, GAP-P474, HMSL-P0675, PRI-S0570, S363ANI + M76, S40RTS77, savani78, SEMUCB-WM179and TX201580. It is generally observed that dV/Vanomalies in P-wave models have lower amplitudes than in S-wave models. This difference is driven by the relatively larger changes in shear modulus versus bulk modulus, (mainly) as a function of temperature heterogeneities in the mantle.
Extended Data Fig.
1compares models in the 1,000-km-thick slice containing the Réunion mid-mantle branch and the SIO CMB corridor beneath it. DETOX-P3 and GAP-P4 capture the general structure of the LLVP and cusp area but lack resolution beneath Réunion. PRI-S05, S40RTS and TX2015 have the highest overall resemblance to RROx-19. All models capture the sharp, tilting western edge of the LLVP. None of the models shows comparable details to RROx-19 in the upper mantle, and most of them fail to image a connection of the LLVP with the upper mantle. Notably, DETOX-P3 does not resolve nearly as much structure under this study area, despite incorporating RHUM–RUM data in the inversion. This is no surprise since the data coverage in a global model is very heterogeneous and a dataset like RHUM–RUM would not fall into full focus.
Extended Data Fig.
6compares models in the 1,000-km-thick slice containing the two mid-mantle branches towards Afar (East Africa) and Bouvet. The Afar branch has been well imaged in previous studies6,37. DETOX-P3 and GAP-P4 show the general shape of the LLVP and the connection to Afar. On the CMB vertically beneath Afar, a low velocity is visible (Supplementary Fig.
4, best seen in models S362ANI + M, SEMUCB-WM1 and TX2015), which does not seem connected to low-velocity anomalies vertically above it, in the upper third of the mantle. Only PRI-S05, S40RTS and TX2915 capture similar structures as RROx-19, including the mid-branch towards Bouvet.
Extended Data Fig.
4compares models within ~500 km above the CMB. Amplitudes in P models are lower but are in good agreement with S models about the extent of the LLVP. The southeast-striking SIO corridor is prominent in all models but is more narrowly focused in RROx-19 than in other models (except perhaps S40RTS). All models (except for GAP-P4) show signs of a north–south corridor along the CMB extending from South Africa towards Afar. No model shows a clear, narrow CMB corridor towards Bouvet, but there are hints (a southwestward bulge of the slowest isosurfaces) in RROx-19, DETOX-P3 and the S-wave models (PRI-S05, SEMUCB-WM1, S40RTS and S362ANI + M).
Resolution testsFor resolution tests, synthetic travel-time data vectors are computed on the basis of synthetic, user-defined input models and a noise term (with realistic statistical properties). Solutions are then obtained through the same inversion procedure and parameter settings as for the observed data. The comparison between input and output models gives insights into how faithfully and completely the tomography can recover the hypothetical Earth structures.
In Extended Data Fig.
2, we assume two narrow (r= 75 km and 700 km deep) vertical plume conduits beneath the southernmost tip of Madagascar and southwest of Réunion. Both conduits are resolved, but the Madagascar conduit is better resolved (less smearing) than the Réunion conduit due to OBS station coverage.
In Extended Data Fig.
5, we assume ~700-km-broad and ~400-km-high LLVP corridors to investigate the resolvability of these corridors. EA and SIO are well resolved whereas the Bouvet corridor vanishes. This is due to the low coverage of Pdiffphases in this undersampled region.
Supplementary Fig.
3is whole-mantle resolution tests using a Gaussian chequerboard. The chequers are Gaussian spheres where dVp/Vppeaks at their centre (±3%) and tapers exponentially to 1/eof this value at 500 km radius (for the near-surface spheres; sphere radius decreases proportionally with depth.) Recovery in the upper mantle is good where stations are present. We observe excellent recovery of the chequerboard pattern between 800 and 2,000 km depth. Moderate smearing occurs in the mid-mantle and near the CMB, where input anomalies are smaller than the inversion mesh (typically 400 km facet length for tetrahedra at the CMB).
Supplementary Fig.
5is a whole-mantle resolution test simulating vertical, whole-mantle plumes of the kind that we might have expected but did not observe under any Indian Ocean hotspot. This test shows that they would be well recovered if they were similarly thick as the mid-mantle branches that are observed instead. Note the good recovery at the CMB due to the inclusion of Pdiffmeasurements. Some lateral smearing appears below Kerguelen. In the South Atlantic, the model is not well resolved; most anomalies smear with low amplitudes or vanish completely under Tristan da Cunha and St. Helena.
Supplementary Fig.
4is a resolution test for upper-mantle structure under the RHUM–RUM instrumented area, using smaller chequers (500 km2diameter at surface). Recovery is good in areas where OBSs were deployed. Note how the resolution drops in areas with no stations, for example, in the northern part of cross-section 1 and the northeastern part of cross-section 2, where the recovered model smears more and dV/Vamplitude drops. By contrast, in the east of cross-section 3 where OBS are present, we recover the chequers with little smearing. The tomography shows the bulk of the low-velocity anomalies not centred beneath La Réunion but slightly shifted to the southwest (coinciding with the expected progression direction of the hotspot track).
Supplementary Fig.
6tests the extent of artificial upward smearing in the upper 400 km. The resolution input model is RROx-19 with all structure in the upper 400 km removed. The output shows upward smearing beneath the southern Mozambique Channel and the Central Indian Ridge but no vertical smearing beneath Réunion itself (the region most densely instrumented by OBS).
Supplementary Fig.
7tests the extent of artificial downward smearing below 300 km. This is an ambitious test because body-wave tomographies tend to have poor ray crossing in the uppermost mantle, and the crustal model is never perfect. Both factors contribute to artificial downward smearing. The input model is a surface-wave tomography model inverted from RHUM–RUM Rayleigh-wave measurements by Mazzullo et al.
31, which extends from 0 to 300 km depth. At 100–200 km depth, our body-wave inversion recovers the overall structure of the surface-wave model well, but it does not resolve vertical transitions, such as the change from red (at 100 km) to blue (at 200 km) in the southeastern quadrangle of the model. Moderate artificial smearing is observed down to 400 km, and weak smearing down to 600 km. Smearing is more pronounced outside of the instrumented area.

Extended Data Fig. 2 Tomography result and resolution test for two thin vertical plume conduits observed in the upper mantle slight southwest of La Réunion and offshore southernmost Madagascar.
Top row, left: Joint tomography model (ISC, Pdiff, RHUM-RUM P) at 200 km depth (map outcrop extending from 11ºS/45ºE to 26ºS/65ºE). Purple dots are RHUM-RUM OBS locations. The dominant feature is the sharp, SW-NE-trending contrast between slow (red) anomalies around the Réunion hotspot and its asthenospheric flows towards the Central Indian Ridge (which runs N-S along the easternmost edge of the map), versus the fast (blue) anomalies of the Mascarene basin’s old, thick lithosphere. Top right: Cross-section through the two slow conduits. Its location is marked in the previous map by a black line and coloured dots. (Due to their three-dimensional, moderately tilting geometries, the conduits are more clearly apparent as such in the 3-D thick-slice rendering of Fig.
3.) Second row: Cross-sections of resolution test input and output, consisting of two vertical columns of 150 km diameter in the observed locations, from the surface to 700 km depth. Rows 3-6: Resolution test input and output at 150, 300, 500 and 700 km depth. The Réunion column is more difficult to recover than the Madagascar column because it falls into a gap between OBS stations.
Extended Data Fig. 3 Whole mantle cross-section striking north-south through Réunion; the view is from the east.
Left panel shows a 2-D section; right panel shows the same section supplemented by low-velocity isosurfaces rendered in a 1000-km thick great-circle slice (shaded blue in the globe inset). Same rendering styles as in Fig.
2. This perspective shows most clearly the absence of Réunion plume tail into the lowermost mantle. Long-dashed purple line marks the interpreted cusp of the LLVP, as in Fig.
3. Bull’s-eye marks the area where the Kerguelen mid-mantle branch emerges toward the viewer.
Extended Data Fig. 4 Model comparison of seismically slow anomalies extending up to 500 km above the CMB (2400-2900 km depth).
The same 4 P-velocity and 6 S-velocity models are rendered as in Extended Data Fig.
1. Visualization style of five nested, slow velocity isosurfaces is the same as in Figs.
2,3, and Extended Data Fig.
1. The orange line at the CMB outlines the Plume Generation Zone proposed by ref.
4. Southwestward away from the LLVP’s core (reddest area), in direction of 7 o’clock, DETOX-P3 and all six S-wave models show a bulge towards Bouvet hotspot. This observation is consistent with the existence of a fully developed CMB corridor towards Bouvet, which would be recovered only as such a vestigial bulge (see targeted resolution test Extended Data Fig.
5) by our tomography, and presumably by others.
Extended Data Fig. 5 Seismic resolvability of three slow corridors at the CMB.
Left: the resolution test input consists of three corridor-like, slow anomalies diverging from the LLVP centre under South Africa. Its geometries are idealised from lowermost mantle structure imaged by RROx-19. As in the tomography, corridors are ~700 km wide and 500 km ‘high’ above the CMB. The white column shows the location of Bouvet. Right: the results of this test confirm that the Southern Indian Ocean and East African corridors can be recovered well, while a Bouvet corridor would not be resolvable in our model, except for remnant southeastward bulging, away from the LLVP’s core. Such a bulge is actually observed by all S-wave tomographies in Extended Data Fig.
4, and by P-wave model DETOX-P3. Hence the presence of a fully developed CMB corridor towards Bouvet is consistent with currently available data.
Extended Data Fig. 6 Thick-slice cross-section through Afar, South Africa, and Bouvet (see globe inset): comparison of our model (top) with other published tomography models.
Same 3-D visualisation and same models rendered as in Supplementary Fig.
1. Colour bar refers to dVp/Vpin % for P-velocity models and dVs/Vsfor S-velocity models. Orange line on the CMB outlines the ‘Plume Generation Zone’ proposed by Burke et al. (ref.
