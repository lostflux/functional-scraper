The Snapchat maker revamped its developer platform policies on March 17, 2022, to ban anonymous apps and require developers to build friend-finding apps to limit access to users 18 or older. The policy changes were effective immediately and existing developers were given 30 days to come into compliance \u2014 a date that would have passed last month.<\/p>\nIt is now mid-May and some developers of the newly banned and restricted apps are not yet meeting Snap\u2019s new requirements.<\/p>\nSnap confirmed to TechCrunch a small number of apps were given extensions, including anonymous apps LMK and Send It. But others seemed to be working around Snap’s ban with their friend-finding apps marketed to users ages 12+, instead of the now required 18+. They got away with this by not actually using the SDK — something impossible to tell from their App Store marketing and screenshots which imply they’re directly integrated with Snap’s features. Another app had flown under the radar, continuing to operate in violation of the rules unless TechCrunch pointed it out, resulting in a belated ban. This lack of clarity on which apps are platform apps, and which are only pretending to be, could complicate things for Snap, which is engaged in litigation over bullying-related suicides. And like all social media, the company could be under new U.S. regulation related to child safety matters in the future, as well.<\/p>\n"embed breakout\">\n"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"Bd2UjCgxsR\">"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/05\/17\/snapchats-stricter-policies-for-anonymous-apps-and-friend-finders-arent-yet-fully-enforced\/\">Snapchat’s stricter policies for anonymous apps and friend finders aren’t yet fully enforced<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"“Snapchat’s stricter policies for anonymous apps and friend finders aren’t yet fully enforced” — TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/05\/17\/snapchats-stricter-policies-for-anonymous-apps-and-friend-finders-arent-yet-fully-enforced\/embed\/#?secret=e39VRJvFjG#?secret=Bd2UjCgxsR\" data-secret=\"Bd2UjCgxsR\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\nTwitter deal still a go… for now<\/h3>\nFirst,"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/05\/13\/elon-musk-twitter-deal-on-hold-spam\/\">Elon Musk tweeted<\/a> that the Twitter deal was “temporarily on hold” until Twitter could prove the percentage of spambots on its platform was actually less than 5%, as it reports.

Now, instead of asking users to agree to any subscription price increases, developers will be able to roll out a price increase with the user\u2019s explicit consent. The feature allows developers to simply inform customers they\u2019ll be charged more, but not require the customer to opt-in to the higher pricing.<\/p>\n"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/04\/05\/apple-pilot-tests-feature-that-allows-developers-to-automatically-charge-users-for-subscription-price-increases\/\">We first broke the news that Apple was pilot testing this program<\/a> last month, when it appeared Disney+ subscription customers had simply been told their price was increasing but weren\u2019t asked for their consent. Apple then confirmed this was the result of a \u201cnew commerce feature\u201d it planned to launch soon, which it said would be \u201cgreat for both developers and users.\u201d<\/p>\nApple\u2019s position is that this could save customers the hassle of having their subscriptions automatically canceled just because they didn\u2019t see the notification or email that asked them to opt in to the price increase.<\/p>\n\u201cThis has led to some services being unintentionally interrupted for users and they must take steps to resubscribe within the app, from Settings on iPhone and iPad, or in the App Store on Mac,\u201d the company explained in its announcement on Monday.<\/p>\nHowever, the flip side of this argument is that those same customers who would have missed the consent notification will likely be the same ones who would now miss the notification informing them their subscription will be increasing in price. There\u2019s also an argument here that this change could enable unscrupulous developers and scammers to better profit from their victims if Apple doesn’t carefully enforce the program rules.<\/p>\nCurrently, those state that developers can\u2019t increase prices more than once per year. The increase also can\u2019t exceed 50% of the subscription price, and the difference in price can\u2019t exceed $5 USD per period for non-annual subscriptions or $50 USD for annual subscriptions.<\/p>\nWeekly News<\/h1>\nPlatforms: Apple<\/h3>\n\nApple"https:\/\/9to5mac.com\/2022\/05\/19\/ios-15-6-beta-1-available-public-beta-testers\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">released<\/a> the first public betas of iOS 15.6,<\/strong>\u00a0iPadOS 15.6, tvOS 15.6,"https:\/\/www.imore.com\/how-download-watchos-8-public-beta\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">watchOS 8.7<\/a> and macOS 12.5.

They join for the opportunity to have an impact and to grow. And so in a lot of cases, it may be a more opportune time to take a chance in an early-stage company because you can focus on that long-term horizon, and you can get that opportunity to grow and have an impact,\u201d Hoffman told me.<\/p>\nFor employees, he said there will still be opportunities at good companies in any economic conditions, but attracting talent always comes down to creating a good place to work.<\/p>\n“Even in the tightest of economic environments \u2014 and we\u2019re not there yet \u2014 there\u2019s always going to be high demand for the best talent. Always. So the things that you need to do to attract, engage and retain these employees does not change,” he said.

for comment, cofounder Pejman Nozad emailed back, “I can’t comment!”<\/p>\nNozad and cofounder Mar Hershenson have long been first-stop for prominent early-stage investors that are looking to fund nascent teams, given the firm has been among the earliest backers in a notable number of companies that have gone to raise ever-bigger rounds and higher valuations, including the now publicly traded companies DoorDash and Guardant Health.<\/p>\nOther startups to attract capital from Pear before nearly any other firm was aware of their existence include the deep-linking startup Branch, which

likely to see the valuations of its still-private portfolio companies slide downward — possibly by a lot — depending on how long this correction lasts.<\/p>\nHershenson, who joined TechCrunch for a mobility-focused event this week, noted on stage that startups are in for a bumpy ride, given how frothy the market had grown.<\/p>"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\nAsked if the"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/for-tech-startups-the-party-is-over-11652710330?mod=tech_lead_pos5\">startup party is over<\/a>, Hershenson answered: “Maybe for a little while it’s over . . .The problem is that the market was priced too high in 2021, and we’re all adjusting to that price change, and that changes how companies raise money.<\/p>\n“Everybody knows that the stock market is down a lot,” she’d said. “Software stocks are down in some cases 80%. [Meanwhile] if you’re a private company, and you were very lucky and you raised money in 2021, you may have gotten a multiple of 100x on your ARR. Today, those multiples are 10x or 20x. That means that if your company was $2 billion [at the time of your fundraise], your company is [now] worth $200 million.:<\/p>\nEven with a steep reset in prices, however, Pear’s success to date is undeniable. It’s also unlikely.<\/p>\nNozad, very famously, was earlier a rug dealer who insisted on toting rugs to his clients’ homes, where during the course of long conversations, they would learn about the rug and he would learn about their business. He eventually became a scout for his boss, and a trusted friend to some very powerful people.<\/p>\n\u201cHe has a good sniffer, and I trust the guy,\u201d\u00a0 Sequoia\u2019s Doug Leone"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/victoriabarret\/2012\/03\/21\/silicon-valleys-hottest-vc-is-a-rug-dealer\/?sh=3dfe6dbb31d5\">told Forbes<\/a> back in 2012. \u201cHe\u2019s like me, from the earth.\u201d Sequoia has, in fact, backed a number of companies that Pear has funded, including Guardant Health and DoorDash.<\/p>\nMeanwhile, his partner, Mar Hershenson, was also very much an outlier when the two struck out on their own. Despite founding several companies previously — one of which Nozad backed — and though she holds an M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Stanford University, she is a native of Spain and even more unusual in VC circles a decade ago, she is a woman who had not previously cut her teeth at someone else’s venture firm.<\/p>\nThat may not seem very notable today but in 2012, it put Hershenson in rare company.<\/p>\nAs for the team’s newest bets, Pear hosted an invite-only demo day earlier this week, coverage of which we’ll have for readers soon. (Unlike Y Combinator, the outfit holds a demo day each year for a comparatively limited number of companies — typically around 10.)<\/p>\nIn the meantime, some of its other recent checks have gone to Sudozi, a two-year-old Austin, Tex., startup that provides a SaaS platform to help enterprises improve their money management capabilities and that just this month announced a"https:\/\/venturebeat.com\/2022\/05\/12\/sudozi-nabs-4-3m-to-simplify-money-management-for-enterprises\/\">$4.3 million<\/a> seed round led by Pear.<\/p>\nPear also recently wrote a follow-on check to Osmind, a two-year-old, Bay Area-based startup that makes software to chart and update patient information and documents, with a focus on mental health.

The Snapchat maker revamped its developer platform policies on March 17, 2022, to ban anonymous apps and require developers to build friend-finding apps to limit access to users 18 or older. The policy changes were effective immediately and existing developers were given 30 days to come into compliance \u2014 a date that would have passed last month.<\/p>\nIt is now mid-May and some developers of the newly banned and restricted apps are not yet meeting Snap\u2019s new requirements.<\/p>\nSnap confirmed to TechCrunch a small number of apps were given extensions, including anonymous apps LMK and Send It. But others seemed to be working around Snap’s ban with their friend-finding apps marketed to users ages 12+, instead of the now required 18+. They got away with this by not actually using the SDK — something impossible to tell from their App Store marketing and screenshots which imply they’re directly integrated with Snap’s features. Another app had flown under the radar, continuing to operate in violation of the rules unless TechCrunch pointed it out, resulting in a belated ban. This lack of clarity on which apps are platform apps, and which are only pretending to be, could complicate things for Snap, which is engaged in litigation over bullying-related suicides. And like all social media, the company could be under new U.S. regulation related to child safety matters in the future, as well.<\/p>\n"embed breakout\">\n"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"Bd2UjCgxsR\">"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/05\/17\/snapchats-stricter-policies-for-anonymous-apps-and-friend-finders-arent-yet-fully-enforced\/\">Snapchat’s stricter policies for anonymous apps and friend finders aren’t yet fully enforced<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"“Snapchat’s stricter policies for anonymous apps and friend finders aren’t yet fully enforced” — TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/05\/17\/snapchats-stricter-policies-for-anonymous-apps-and-friend-finders-arent-yet-fully-enforced\/embed\/#?secret=e39VRJvFjG#?secret=Bd2UjCgxsR\" data-secret=\"Bd2UjCgxsR\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\nTwitter deal still a go… for now<\/h3>\nFirst,"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/05\/13\/elon-musk-twitter-deal-on-hold-spam\/\">Elon Musk tweeted<\/a> that the Twitter deal was “temporarily on hold” until Twitter could prove the percentage of spambots on its platform was actually less than 5%, as it reports.

Now, instead of asking users to agree to any subscription price increases, developers will be able to roll out a price increase with the user\u2019s explicit consent. The feature allows developers to simply inform customers they\u2019ll be charged more, but not require the customer to opt-in to the higher pricing.<\/p>\n"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/04\/05\/apple-pilot-tests-feature-that-allows-developers-to-automatically-charge-users-for-subscription-price-increases\/\">We first broke the news that Apple was pilot testing this program<\/a> last month, when it appeared Disney+ subscription customers had simply been told their price was increasing but weren\u2019t asked for their consent. Apple then confirmed this was the result of a \u201cnew commerce feature\u201d it planned to launch soon, which it said would be \u201cgreat for both developers and users.\u201d<\/p>\nApple\u2019s position is that this could save customers the hassle of having their subscriptions automatically canceled just because they didn\u2019t see the notification or email that asked them to opt in to the price increase.<\/p>\n\u201cThis has led to some services being unintentionally interrupted for users and they must take steps to resubscribe within the app, from Settings on iPhone and iPad, or in the App Store on Mac,\u201d the company explained in its announcement on Monday.<\/p>\nHowever, the flip side of this argument is that those same customers who would have missed the consent notification will likely be the same ones who would now miss the notification informing them their subscription will be increasing in price. There\u2019s also an argument here that this change could enable unscrupulous developers and scammers to better profit from their victims if Apple doesn’t carefully enforce the program rules.<\/p>\nCurrently, those state that developers can\u2019t increase prices more than once per year. The increase also can\u2019t exceed 50% of the subscription price, and the difference in price can\u2019t exceed $5 USD per period for non-annual subscriptions or $50 USD for annual subscriptions.<\/p>\nWeekly News<\/h1>\nPlatforms: Apple<\/h3>\n\nApple"https:\/\/9to5mac.com\/2022\/05\/19\/ios-15-6-beta-1-available-public-beta-testers\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">released<\/a> the first public betas of iOS 15.6,<\/strong>\u00a0iPadOS 15.6, tvOS 15.6,"https:\/\/www.imore.com\/how-download-watchos-8-public-beta\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">watchOS 8.7<\/a> and macOS 12.5.

The U.K.-based nonprofit aims to transform Ph.D. researchers into venture scientists.<\/p>\n“It\u2019s a simple but well-proven recipe,” Kanso said. “You have a Ph.D. team working on cutting-edge research with key real-world applications. They know their innovation could help discover effective treatments for now-incurable diseases, power up carbon-negative cities or tackle the future of automation. Through a combination of entrepreneurship training, access to pro-bono legal advice, funding opportunities and expert connections, we help them figure out how to turn their research into a viable deep tech startup.”<\/p>\nIt isn’t a new thing for universities to more or less willingly give birth to spinoffs or spinouts (we will use the terms interchangeably here.) MIT, for instance, is famous for counting"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/List_of_companies_founded_by_Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology_alumni\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">many entrepreneurs<\/a> among its alumni, and quite a few of these ventures are based on intellectual property developed during their studies or research.<\/p>\nBut in Europe, intellectual property can be a thorny issue. The “potential for meaningful innovation brewing across Europe\u2019s research labs,” Kanso said, “largely remains untapped due to varying \u2014 and at times"https:\/\/sifted.eu\/articles\/university-tech-transfer-overhaul\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">stifling<\/a> \u2014 IP ownership rules that can make spinout companies uninvestable and hard to scale.”<\/p>\nIncreasingly though, both European universities and venture capital firms are making efforts to make sure the most promising seeds turn into successful companies.<\/p>\nMind the gap<\/h2>\nDespite the hurdles, VCs looking for innovation know that spinouts are very much worth their attention. “As an investor in early-stage businesses, many with a deeply technical nature, we see universities as foundational to the companies we invest in,” said Simon King, himself a VC with a Ph.D.

rel=\"noopener\">Chain Reaction<\/a> podcast this week, we dove into a topic that tends to stir up strong emotions, even from those outside the crypto space — the metaverse. Mercedes Bent, an investor at Lightspeed Venture Partners who focuses on consumer investments in crypto, joined us to unpack this loaded term and explain why she sees its potential.<\/p>\n“It’s become like a punching bag,” Bent told TechCrunch. “If you think about the potential of it, and why maybe a geek like me gets excited about it, it’s because there are things you can do [in the metaverse] that you could not do in the real world.”<\/p>\n"https:\/\/player.simplecast.com\/6c95a13b-acfb-478d-9707-30750d5d461f?dark=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"200px\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\"><\/iframe><\/p>\nThe prospect of attending an event with tens of thousands of other attendees across the world in the metaverse, for example, excites Bent. But even more than entertainment, Bent is enthusiastic about the potential for the metaverse to have an impact through education. She shared the hypothetical example of public school students being able to learn from the best instructors in the world in a metaverse similar to the movie Ready Player One — though without the dystopian elements, she qualified. Bent’s vision squares up with some of her non-crypto consumer investments at Lightspeed, such as small-group live education platform"https:\/\/lsvp.com\/portfolio\/outschool\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Outschool<\/a>.<\/p>\nBut what will the metaverse actually look like? When we asked Bent, who once worked for virtual reality technology company Upload, she said she used to think the metaverse had to be tied to VR technology, specifically the head-mounted display screen.<\/p>\nShe’s since realized that what the metaverse has to offer has less to do with how users access it physically and more to do with the sense of community it can foster.<\/p>\n“I think what this era — the 2021 and 2022 era of the metaverse terminology — has shown is that it’s not about the headset, it’s not about what physical apparatus you use, it’s about the sense of [a] collective being together, and presence,” she added.<\/p>"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\nWhile VR tech itself has been around for decades, Bent posits that the metaverse gained traction as a concept last year because it offered one thing classic VR games like Second Life did not — the ability to transfer in-game currency to fiat currency. Cryptocurrency, she believes, made that switch possible.<\/p>\n“There was obviously in-game currency and there were obviously virtual goods you could buy before, but the ability to be able to transfer that to fiat and then go use it in the real world to pay your rent bill is just something entirely different that we didn’t have in such a mass quantity before,” Bent said.<\/p>\nThat technological development coupled with the onset of the pandemic, which gave people the opportunity to spend more time online, gave the metaverse new life, she continued.<\/p>\nSkeptics think the metaverse gets a lot of hype and isn’t backed by substantial technology or user adoption. Bent said that in her experience, skepticism is to be expected for any early-stage consumer products.<\/p>\n“These hyped areas look really nonobvious. I mean, they don’t have traction, they’re just an idea. They’re often from a founder who hasn’t necessarily had the most pedigree, so you have to kind of take a leap of faith,” Bent said. Bent’s mission as an investor is to back “early stage consumer companies that are unlocking wealth creation for underserved individuals and regions,” according to her website — a thesis that might help explain where she finds some of that faith.<\/p>\nAs an early-stage consumer investor, Bent pushes back on the idea that it’s too early to fund consumer-facing crypto companies that haven’t yet honed their user experience.<\/p>\n“There are not very many companies [in web3] that I would say have scaled to what I would call a mass audience yet. We have Metamask, which is pretty far along, but I think all of these companies are up for grabs in terms of [whether] somebody else could come along to replace them,” Bent said. “I think we’re going to see the next WhatsApp, AOL, and Google founded in short order.”<\/p>\n"embed breakout\">\n"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"nehAIR6VLp\">"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/05\/19\/blockchain-billionaire-sam-bankman-fried-big-bet-robinhood-chain-reaction\/\">A blockchain billionaire’s big bet<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"“A blockchain billionaire’s big bet” — TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/05\/19\/blockchain-billionaire-sam-bankman-fried-big-bet-robinhood-chain-reaction\/embed\/#?secret=y8X6xbCV7I#?secret=nehAIR6VLp\" data-secret=\"nehAIR6VLp\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n"article-content\">\nSubscribe to Chain Reaction on\u00a0"https:\/\/podcasts.apple.com\/us\/podcast\/chain-reaction\/id1616008890\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Apple<\/a>,\u00a0"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/show\/6dC9jw0YyPqnul5P3CECoN\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Spotify<\/a> or your alternative podcast platform of choice to keep up with us every week.<\/em><\/p>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"On the Chain Reaction podcast this week, we dove into a topic that tends to stir up strong emotions, even from those outside the crypto space — the metaverse.

on shaky ground at the moment.
"https:\/\/www.antenna.live\/post\/netflix-q122-retrospective\">Antenna<\/a> data reveals that Netflix saw 3.6 million subscription cancellations in the first quarter of 2022, over one million more than the company experienced in Q1 2021 and Q4 2021. This is a significant indicator that Netflix is inching closer to losing its top spot in the streaming battle.<\/p>\nWhile Netflix’s downfall has raised speculations about if the SVOD (subscription video on demand) industry has peaked and is beginning a downward trend, new Antenna data supports the contrary.<\/p>\nAntenna discovered that U.S. Subscriptions in the Premium SVOD category grew +4.0% quarter-over-quarter and by +24.7% year-over-year. The research also shows that there were 37.4 million new gross SVOD customers and a loss of 29.8 million subscribers, leaving a gross of just 7.7 million new subscribers in the first quarter of 2022.<\/p>\n"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Screen-Shot-2022-05-13-at-12.54.44-PM.png\">"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2318637\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Screen-Shot-2022-05-13-at-12.54.44-PM.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"343\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Screen-Shot-2022-05-13-at-12.54.44-PM.png 919w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Screen-Shot-2022-05-13-at-12.54.44-PM.png?resize=150,76 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Screen-Shot-2022-05-13-at-12.54.44-PM.png?resize=300,151 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Screen-Shot-2022-05-13-at-12.54.44-PM.png?resize=768,388 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Screen-Shot-2022-05-13-at-12.54.44-PM.png?resize=680,343 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Screen-Shot-2022-05-13-at-12.54.44-PM.png?resize=50,25 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n"attachment_2318635\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/antenna-streaming-1536x768-1.webp\">"caption-attachment-2318635\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2318635\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/antenna-streaming-1536x768-1.webp?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"340\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/antenna-streaming-1536x768-1.webp 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/antenna-streaming-1536x768-1.webp?resize=150,75 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/antenna-streaming-1536x768-1.webp?resize=300,150 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/antenna-streaming-1536x768-1.webp?resize=768,384 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/antenna-streaming-1536x768-1.webp?resize=680,340 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/antenna-streaming-1536x768-1.webp?resize=50,25 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><\/a>"caption-attachment-2318635\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image Credits:<\/strong> Antenna<\/p><\/div><\/p>\nThe 37.4 number is consistent with the past two quarters yet significantly higher than 2019 (before Covid-19). The growth was largely driven by fledgling services Peacock and Paramount+, which added a combined 6.1 million or more U.S. Subscribers.<\/p>\nIn comparison, in 2019, when the market was dominated by Netflix and Hulu (services like Disney+, Peacock, and HBO Max didn\u2019t exist yet), there were a total of 10.3 million subscriptions in the year\u2019s first quarter.

There were just under 30 million cancellations in Q1 2022, which is 12% higher than any quarter in history, or 4.5 times the cancel volume seen three years prior, Antenna finds.<\/p>\nThe cancellations may not be anything to worry about since the new subscriber additions indicate consumers are bouncing around– also known as churn and return. Paramount+, Peacock, and Disney+ accounted for 51% of all new sign-ups in the quarter. Plus, the three mentioned services made up a large portion of new sign-ups for the churned Q1 2022 Netflix users.<\/p>\n"attachment_2319105\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Screen-Shot-2022-05-16-at-11.49.36-AM.png\">"caption-attachment-2319105\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2319105\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Screen-Shot-2022-05-16-at-11.49.36-AM.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"346\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Screen-Shot-2022-05-16-at-11.49.36-AM.png 918w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Screen-Shot-2022-05-16-at-11.49.36-AM.png?resize=150,76 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Screen-Shot-2022-05-16-at-11.49.36-AM.png?resize=300,153 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Screen-Shot-2022-05-16-at-11.49.36-AM.png?resize=768,391 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Screen-Shot-2022-05-16-at-11.49.36-AM.png?resize=680,346 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Screen-Shot-2022-05-16-at-11.49.36-AM.png?resize=50,25 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><\/a>"caption-attachment-2319105\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image Credits:<\/strong> Antenna<\/p><\/div><\/p>\nPeter Fondulas, principal at Hub,"https:\/\/www.tvtechnology.com\/news\/new-research-suggests-the-streaming-party-isnt-over\">stated<\/a>, \u201cNetflix\u2019s subscriber loss in Q1 of 2022, and its anticipated losses in the following quarters, represent a tiny proportion of its global subscriber base. And in fact, at some point, a service as widely penetrated as Netflix has only so much room left to grow. In our view, it would be a grave mistake to take the Netflix experience as a sign that streaming TV services are on the verge of decline, as some analysts have suggested. The lure of buzzworthy exclusive content, and the sheer convenience of on-demand viewing, are two powerful forces that should keep these services growing at least for the near term.\u201d<\/p>\nIn Q1 2022, Netflix reported a"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/04\/19\/netflix-shares-down-more-than-20-after-losing-200000-subscribers-in-first-quarter\/\">loss of 200,000 subscribers<\/a>, making its first subscriber loss in more than ten years. The decline brought Netflix\u2019s subscriber base to 221.6 million, down from 221.8 million in the previous quarter. The losses will only continue, according to Netflix forecasts, and the streamer is expected to lose 2 million in the second quarter.<\/p>\nSince Netflix raised prices on all its plan tiers domestically in"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/01\/14\/netflix-raised-its-prices-again\/\">January 2022<\/a>, there has been a major jump in subscription cancellations.

That means the folks in charge of hiring are still going to have to shake the bushes for talent.<\/p>\nMatt Hoffman, partner and head of talent at VC firm M13 and a former HR pro, said for a lot of people, the desire to be a part of something and help it grow is in some ways a stronger motivator than perks and pay. That\u2019s good news for startups looking for talent.<\/p>\n“I’ve always believed that people don’t join a company just for the economic benefits. They join for the opportunity to have an impact and to grow. And so in a lot of cases, it may be a more opportune time to take a chance in an early-stage company because you can focus on that long-term horizon, and you can get that opportunity to grow and have an impact,\u201d Hoffman told me.<\/p>\nFor employees, he said there will still be opportunities at good companies in any economic conditions, but attracting talent always comes down to creating a good place to work.<\/p>\n“Even in the tightest of economic environments \u2014 and we\u2019re not there yet \u2014 there\u2019s always going to be high demand for the best talent. Always. So the things that you need to do to attract, engage and retain these employees does not change,” he said.

problem is that the market was priced too high in 2021, and we’re all adjusting to that price change, and that changes how companies raise money.<\/p>\n“Everybody knows that the stock market is down a lot,” she’d said. “Software stocks are down in some cases 80%. [Meanwhile] if you’re a private company, and you were very lucky and you raised money in 2021, you may have gotten a multiple of 100x on your ARR. Today, those multiples are 10x or 20x. That means that if your company was $2 billion [at the time of your fundraise], your company is [now] worth $200 million.:<\/p>\nEven with a steep reset in prices, however, Pear’s success to date is undeniable. It’s also unlikely.<\/p>\nNozad, very famously, was earlier a rug dealer who insisted on toting rugs to his clients’ homes, where during the course of long conversations, they would learn about the rug and he would learn about their business.

Despite founding several companies previously — one of which Nozad backed — and though she holds an M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Stanford University, she is a native of Spain and even more unusual in VC circles a decade ago, she is a woman who had not previously cut her teeth at someone else’s venture firm.<\/p>\nThat may not seem very notable today but in 2012, it put Hershenson in rare company.<\/p>\nAs for the team’s newest bets, Pear hosted an invite-only demo day earlier this week, coverage of which we’ll have for readers soon.

It’s been a period of unprecedented boom for crypto startups, but life has been looking a bit less pleasant for Coinbase since Bitcoin and the public markets hit their frothy peak in November of last year.<\/p>\nCoinbase is currently trading below $65 per share after a more than 80% decline from its November all-time high. A lot of other public market tech stocks are also feeling the hurt, but relative to just how much revenue Coinbase pulled in last year, it’s clear investors have nuked their expectations for the company’s future performance. Coinbase did $7.4 billion in net revenue in 2021 and is currently rocking a market cap below $14 billion. That’s nuts.<\/p>\nPublic market investors may not have the rosiest view of Coinbase, but the question is how this really impacts the company. Well, the firm is adjusting its growth expectations for one thing. COO Emilie Choi announced this week that the company was hitting the brakes, “Heading into this year, we planned to triple the size of the company. Given current market conditions, we feel it\u2019s prudent to slow hiring and reassess…”<\/p>\nThis is expected, but isn’t great for a company that has several cash-swolen competitors all chasing their market share. The company has been diversifying its offerings looking to leverage its network and provide more of a browser for the nascent web3 world, but it’s unclear what kind of consumer pickup the crypto world is looking at over the next year compared to the past couple, something which has left the company in a fairly grim position for the near-term…<\/p>\n\/>\nthe latest podcast<\/h3>\n"font-weight: 400;\">Hey, it\u2019s <\/span>"https:\/\/twitter.com\/AnitaRamaswamy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">"font-weight: 400;\">Anita<\/span><\/a>,"font-weight: 400;\"> here to give you an update on our latest episode of Chain Reaction, where we unpack the latest web3 news, block-by-block for the crypto-curious.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n"font-weight: 400;\">In this episode, we talked about <\/span>"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/05\/16\/blockchain-billionaire-sam-bankman-fried-roasts-bitcoin-popular-cryptocurrency\/\">"font-weight: 400;\">30-year-old blockchain billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried<\/span><\/a>"font-weight: 400;\"> (SBF) buying a 7.6% stake in Robinhood and what he could possibly be planning to do to help turn around the struggling exchange amid a rough first half of the year.

founders should start talking now to bankers and potential buyers"},"content":{"rendered":""speakable-summary\">Founders have gotten the memo that the ground is shifting under their feet right now. What to do about it is the question. Already, teams are making plans to scale back their spending to preserve capital. They’re making painful staff cuts toward that same end — or else instituting hiring freezes.<\/p>\nBut they should also be thinking a lot harder about building relationships with bankers and the larger companies that might conceivably be interested in acquiring their startup, say two attorneys who work on both the ‘buy’ and ‘sell’ side of transactions, with both large companies and venture-backed outfits, and who both have more than 20 years of experience.<\/p>\nIndeed, to better understand some of the options founders may have, we talked earlier today with Denny Kwon and Scott Anthony, both of whom represent the white shoe law firm Covington & Burling (where former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder is also an attorney). They answered a range of questions that we thought startups might be wondering about right now. Our chat has been edited lightly for length.<\/p>\nTC: How much has the world changed in the last few weeks?<\/strong><\/p>\nDK: There is certainly a feeling of more pressure on sellers to get deals done as quickly as possible in light of the fact that there\u2019s a lot of market volatility right now and they don\u2019t know how buyers may be reacting to a significant decline in their stock price. Smaller companies are also facing the prospect of a slightly more challenging fundraising market, so alternatives for them are narrowing.<\/p>\nTC: Given that public shares are so volatile right now, are acquirers more or less inclined to offer equity as a component of a deal?\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\nDK: It’s much more challenging to price deals with a significant stock component in this market. With any volatility, you don\u2019t get a clear sense of the inherent value of a share, so all-cash deals are much more favorable to targets.<\/p>"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\nTC: Are targets in a position right now to make demands? How much leverage does a startup with dwindling options really have?<\/strong><\/p>\nDK: Whenever we see volatile markets, where valuations were incredibly high [and are] being reset, it always takes time for sellers’ expectations to reset as well, so although they may be a temporary [lull in activity] because of the market, if there\u2019s a ‘normalization’ that\u2019s to come, we\u2019ll probably see M&A activity, especially where valuation expectations are reduced on both the buyers’ and the sellers’ side.<\/p>\nMy sense [right now] is that buyers may view the market correction as being potentially opportunistic but sellers may not have the same expectations because they may hope for a rebound in the near future. Once seller expectations come down and they continue to hear from VCs that funding may not be as available as it was 6 to 12 months ago, they\u2019ll be even harder pressed to turn away acquisition offers that come in.<\/p>\nTC: Are you seeing deals being yanked as buyers look to reprice earlier agreements to their benefit?<\/strong><\/p>\nDK: The pending deals I\u2019m working on are continuing apace.<\/p>\nTC: We’re all hearing — and reading — about very steep valuation drops already. Do you have any sense of how much value your clients have lost in recent weeks or whether certain sectors are getting hit harder than others?<\/strong><\/p>\nSA:There’s valuation pressure, but it’s hard to gauge [the degree]. Certainly, we have companies that were racing to close valuations [before Russia invaded Ukraine] and [that period since] has changed everyone\u2019s expectations. I think there’s concern on the company side that investors are sitting out and that\u2019s driving valuations down.<\/p>\nCompanies with revenues and good prospects will weather any downturn better — they always have. Sector wise, it will depend, but the whole stablecoin [debacle] hasn\u2019t helped the crypto stuff.<\/p>\nTC: How big a concern are antitrust regulators to your bigger clients?\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\nDK: It’s top of mind for all practitioners, but there’s a dichotomy in that some transactions are reportable and others are not. For those that are reportable — the threshold is approximately $100 million —\u00a0 we\u2019re spending an incredible amount of time analyzing the potential for regulatory issues.<\/p>\nTC: How long does an M&A process take, and at what point do both sides agree on a price?<\/strong><\/p>\nDK: From that initial approach from an acquirer, the time period can vary from a few weeks if there is alignment right away, up to several months if the target company wants to see if there is other interest. A lot depends on how compelling that first offer may appear. Once you get to a handshake on a valuation, it\u2019s usually a six- to eight-week process to get a signed definitive agreement.<\/p>\nSA: If the [startup] is the one that is making the decision to find a buyer, then the process \u2013 maybe they hire bankers, maybe they use board members\u2019 connections to reach out to strategics \u2013 the process and timing can be very different depending on how quickly they need the money and how quickly they can get potential buyers interested . . . and the size of the company, but buyers are still going to run their diligence process.<\/p>\nTC: Let’s assume M&A will be a more significant factor, given the cooling funding environment. If you were to advise a startup on the pros and cons about proceeding, what points would you make?<\/strong><\/p>\nDK: Many companies at an inflection point that need to raise money to fund their growth or expansion are going to have a difficult decision to make, which is to either raise a new round where the valuation may not meet their expectations or [where they see a lot of dilution], or an M&A exit, where they see proceeds now but lose out on [potential] upside.<\/p>\nTC: Should startups that are open to selling be reaching out to anyone, or should they wait to see who approaches them? Some might worry their startup’s value will drop as soon as they indicate a willingness to sell.<\/strong><\/p>\nDK:\u00a0 I’d be advising startups to talk to bankers and keep relationships up with people at the larger companies they know simply because we may be in for a longer-term correction, where funding becomes even more challenging than it has been over the last couple of months.<\/p>\nSA: Having relationships with the bankers is prudent so if you have to check the market, you have those relationships already. Also, keeping in contact with customers and bigger strategic partners that would be natural buyers for the company could short-circuit any kind of sale process later.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Founders have gotten the memo that the ground is shifting under their feet right now.

target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Astro<\/a> robot has been scurrying its way around my apartment for the past few weeks. It has no arms to scratch its own head in confusion, but I am willing to do that for him. As part of Amazon’s Day 1 Editions program, the robot is a $1,000 invitation-only program with limited numbers of robots available, as the company is trying to get them into consumers’ hands with a question: How would you use this?<\/p>\nThe company suggests that some use cases include home monitoring — an autonomous home-security system that can wander around from room to room. Astro has the ability to patrol a home with Ring Protect Pro, pop its periscope camera to see the counters, detect unidentified people when in \u201caway mode,\u201d send alerts when it hears sounds like glass breaking and more. You can also use it when you\u2019re home \u2014 if you hear the dog barking at night, you can send Astro to see what\u2019s happening without having to leave the cozy cocoon of your duvet-burrito.<\/p>\nThe company also suggests that Astro might be a good solution for offering remote care.\u00a0Your loved one can ask Astro to set and deliver reminders, or you can useDrop In<\/em> to stay connected. Plus, Astro works with Alexa Together, which allows for remote care for aging loved ones, or for offering care for people who have mobility challenges or other disabilities.<\/p>\nAmazon also offers companionship as a potential use case — it suggests all the fun things Astro can do (things like \u201cAstro beatbox,\u201d or \u201cwhat\u2019s your favorite animal?\u201d are top items, the company suggests), and it has other features that make it seem more like a pet than a Skynet-harboring robot of death and destruction.<\/p>\nThe whole purpose of a Day 1 Edition product is for Amazon’s product teams to get their most ambitious projects into customers\u2019 hands faster so they can provide feedback that, in this case, will help shape the Astro experience. It makes sense. Right now, Astro is a robust system and can handle a wide array of commands and tasks that customers are finding useful. The robot has a little carrying tray and a USB port for extensions that will give it any number of interesting new powers, extendable by hackers and tech-savvy users, much in the same way that someone can write and deploy an Alexa skill today.<\/p>\n"attachment_2322758\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">"caption-attachment-2322758\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2322758\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/PXL_20220520_210408573.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/PXL_20220520_210408573.jpg 2024w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/PXL_20220520_210408573.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/PXL_20220520_210408573.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/PXL_20220520_210408573.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/PXL_20220520_210408573.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/PXL_20220520_210408573.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/PXL_20220520_210408573.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/>"caption-attachment-2322758\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Astro’s sensors mean it doesn’t bump into things too often. And the paint along the bottom of the chassis, and the scrapes on the walls of my apartment, indicate that Astro still has a little bit of learning to do on that front.

The speakers are good, and it’s kinda fun to have a boombox trail around and play your tunes or podcasts as you are doing chores. As a piece of first-generation tech, it’s an impressive feat that has tremendous potential. But that alone isn’t enough to make a product. In a world where the environment is front of mind, we could do with fewer gadgets that will end up in landfills eventually, not more, and so I find myself wondering what this thing is for. I can imagine a number of niche use cases — including the ones listed above — but I keep being unclear on whether this is a device that needs to exist at all.<\/p>"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\nI spoke with Anthony Robson, the principal product manager for robotic technologies and consumer robotics at Amazon, to try to get to the bottom of things. It quickly became clear that Astro’s ambition is sky-high, and that the Amazon team doesn’t quite know which direction that ambition will take it. By design, it claims, which I have some respect for, but it seems weird to me to take a “let’s build it and see if they will come, and what they will use it for” approach.<\/p>\nDon’t misunderstand me; I do believe there are places and use cases where Amazon’s adorable little robot friend makes a lot of sense — but when I talk to startups day in and day out, it feels really jarring. I wouldn’t let a startup get away with a solution looking for a problem, and so it feels curious to be tempted to let Amazon — who really should know better — off the hook.<\/p>\n“This is the very first robot in a brand new category of robots. When we started this program, we were like, why not us? Why not Amazon? You know, we have this great ecosystem with Alex and the AI chops to be able to do this. Let’s do it, let’s learn from customers,” comments Robson. “We went out and did a lot of research around what kinds of things people could envision robots helping them in their home. The home monitoring capabilities were certainly the most popular thing people could envision. I’d love to be able to check if I left the stove on, or whether my back door is unlocked. I’d love to be able to check if I need to buy bananas because the fruit bowl is empty. I want to be able to check if the kids came home or to be notified when they come home. I want to be able to talk to them and find them in the house. So that was a very popular use case that people identified. There are a number of use cases.”<\/p>\n"attachment_2322765\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">"caption-attachment-2322765\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2322765\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/PXL_20220520_210401662.jpg\" alt=\"Astro Cargo Bay\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/PXL_20220520_210401662.jpg 1462w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/PXL_20220520_210401662.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/PXL_20220520_210401662.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/PXL_20220520_210401662.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/PXL_20220520_210401662.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/PXL_20220520_210401662.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/>"caption-attachment-2322765\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Astro’s cargo bay is sizeable and has a USB-C port to extend its functionality further. An SDK to build software for Astro is in the works, Amazon suggests.

Would customers potentially pay $1,000 to solve this problem?<\/p>\nOf course, the additional flexibility of the Astro platform broadens the potential quite a bit.<\/p>\n“We insisted on having some level of extensibility. We’re gonna learn so much about every home — and every home is going to be different and have different needs. So we added a cargo bay area with a USB port, and asked the question ‘how can we extend this platform to do more things for more people?’ We didn’t envision at the beginning of this program that we would have a pet food dispenser at the launch event,” marvels Robson. “We have customers who are working in their home offices on either side of the house sending things to each other using their Astro. We are learning, we are listening and we are adapting. We’re going to extend Astro’s capabilities as we learn from customers.”<\/p>\nThe product team does have a few things on its wish list that it wasn’t able to prioritize for launch for various reasons.<\/p>\n“There are a lot of things that, simply from a practical perspective, we couldn’t add. Astro doesn’t climb stairs, for example. The level of complexity that would add to the product would simply make it too costly, and make it so it’s not accessible to as many people as we would like,” explains Robson. “We had to make trade-offs like that. We would have liked the periscope camera to go that little bit higher. But we had to compromise and say, you know, this is just enough to see over the counters. That is perfect — that keeps the device small.”<\/p>\nThe product team also suggests that it wanted Astro to be able to move around much faster. At its current pace, you can out-walk it if you stroll briskly through the hallways of your mansion — but speed also equals trade-offs. The laws of physics start getting in the way pretty quickly, in other words.<\/p>\n“A"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">gain, the complexity of being able to make sure that it can be safe at all times goes up exponentially. A factor of two, with every increase in speed,” explains Robson. “You have to be very judicious about how much speed you put in because it’s going to make your sensing and your safety solutions twice or multiple times more complex.”<\/span><\/p>\nThe Astro team hasn’t launched a developer toolkit for the Astro robot yet, but that’s on its way, too.<\/p>\n“We’re working hard with strategic partners. I think [an Astro SDK] is going to be happening. We want to bring that intelligent motion capability to more and more skills and accessories in the future,” says Robson. “It is not something we have ready today, but it’s coming very soon. We’re working on it as hard as we can.”<\/p>\n"attachment_2322768\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">"caption-attachment-2322768\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2322768\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/PXL_20220520_210145989.jpg\" alt=\"Amazon Astro with periscope camera\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/PXL_20220520_210145989.jpg 1958w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/PXL_20220520_210145989.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/PXL_20220520_210145989.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/PXL_20220520_210145989.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/PXL_20220520_210145989.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/PXL_20220520_210145989.jpg?resize=1536,1536 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/PXL_20220520_210145989.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/PXL_20220520_210145989.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/PXL_20220520_210145989.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/PXL_20220520_210145989.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/PXL_20220520_210145989.jpg?resize=128,128 128w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/>"caption-attachment-2322768\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The periscope camera pops out and extends telescopically, enabling Astro to look over obstacles and on countertops. A very elegant design choice.
Image Credits:<\/strong>"http:\/\/kamps.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Haje Kamps<\/a> for TechCrunch<\/p><\/div><\/p>\nThe comms team for Astro is excited about the potential of the robot as a comms and monitoring tool. It tells the story of one customer; their father-in-law had fallen out of his wheelchair. The family used Astro to communicate and coordinate emergency service responses to help him get back up. Giving additional, roaming assistance to people living independently seems like a powerful use case — except for the quirk of Astro not being able to climb stairs or open doors.<\/p>\nI did have a couple of fun interactions with Astro that surprised and delighted me. For example, as one part of the setup process, Astro tells you to take a couple of steps back to make space for it to leave its charging dock. As it did that, I swear it flicked the screen representing its “face”, much like one would wave one’s hands to shoo someone away. I was never able to get Astro to do it again, and the product team wasn’t able to confirm whether I hallucinated that, or whether that’s something Astro actually does.<\/p>\n“You know, that’s the thing when you give a robot a body language, depending on what it has to do, it’s going to move in the way it needs to move. Sometimes those things end up being interesting combinations,” laughed Robson. “So I can’t think of exactly why that would happen, but… I have been surprised by Astro before.”<\/p>\nAstro is an extraordinarily well-thought-out robot on a technical level. The big wheels mean it can climb over thresholds between rooms with no issues. It got stuck on my bath mat a few times but managed to dislodge itself every time, which is impressive. When I was testing Astro, I also had a foster kitten, and Astro and Chairman Meow seemed to become good friends, with the two of them chasing each other around the apartment. Astro ran over Meow’s tail once, and Meow got his revenge by folding over the bath mat, trapping Astro in the bathroom for a few hours. I’m not convinced Meow did that on purpose, to be fair, but it did strike me as funny.<\/p>\nThe periscope camera is an extraordinarily clever feature that dramatically increases the usefulness of Astra, and the wayfinding tech is impressive. Telling Astro to go to the kitchen, and having it dutifully scurrying its way around my stacks of Amazon deliveries, office chairs and the odd shoe strewn along the flow was entertaining. A lot of work went into making Astro seem non-threatening. It moves slowly and gingerly near people and pets, it doesn’t bump into stuff all that much, and when it does, it does so carefully. The screen and Astro’s “face” are expressive, and cute, and invite a high degree of trust and user-friendliness. It shows that Amazon has the capacity of building incredibly capable robotics, even when it is compromising on product issues along the way.<\/p>\nIt’s been fun to have Astro wandering about my apartment for a few days, and most of the time I seemed to use it as a roving boom box that also has Alexa capabilities. That’s cute, and all, but $1,000 would buy Alexa devices for every thinkable surface in my room and leave me with enough cash left over to cover the house in cameras. I simply continue to struggle with why Astro makes sense. But then, that’s true for any product that is trying to carve out a brand new product category.<\/p>\nI won’t miss it when I return it to its corporate office to be passed on to the next journalist who will be taking a closer look, which is rarely a good sign, but I hope that Amazon learns enough so it becomes better at telling the story of its adorable little robot. It is, truly, a solution that is carefully and adorably scurrying around looking for a use case. If Astro’s persistence is any indication, it will eventually find one.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Amazon’s cute little Astro robot has been scurrying its way around my apartment for the past few weeks.

Indian company to design, build and test a solid rocket propulsion stage, has reached another key milestone in the development of its Vikram-I launch vehicle: a full-duration test of the rocket\u2019s third stage.<\/p>\nThe third stage, dubbed Kalam-100 in homage to Indian rocket scientist and former President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, is just one part of the company\u2019s debut rocket. Vikram-I includes three solid fuel stages, plus a liquid-fueled kick stage that\u2019s designed to serve the small satellite launch market. It\u2019s designed to carry up to 480 kilograms to low-inclination orbits, and the company says on its website that it\u2019s designed to be assembled and launched from any launch site within 24 hours.<\/p>\nVikram-I is one of a trio of rockets Skyroot is currently developing; the other two, Vikram-II and Vikram-III, will be able to carry heavier payloads with multiple orbital insertions, Skyroot says.<\/p>\nThe test-firing of the rocket stage took place at a private test range in Nagpur City, India, CEO Pawan Kumar Chandana told TechCrunch in an email. That range belongs to Skyroot investor and industrial explosives, ammunitions and propulsion systems manufacturer Solar Industries India.<\/p>\nThe next steps will be test firings for Stage 1 and Stage 2, Chandana said. The company\u2019s existing funding, including an $11 million Series A and a $4.5 million bridge round, will cover most of the costs of testing. Skyroot is in the process of raising a Series B to take the company to \u201cmultiple orbital launches,\u201d he said.<\/p>\nAll this funding should get Skyroot to a technology demonstration launch by the end of this year, with the company\u2019s first commercial orbital mission early next year. That launch would take off from India\u2019s spaceport on Sriharikota Island, and would make Skyroot the first private Indian company to build and launch private rockets.<\/p>"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Skyroot, the first private Indian company to design, build and test a solid rocket propulsion stage, has reached another key milestone in the development of its Vikram-I launch vehicle: a full-duration test of the rocket\u2019s third stage.

decades to track disease. While this information is essential for chronic condition management, these and many other physiological measurements are typically captured only periodically, making it difficult to reliably detect early meaningful changes.<\/p>\nMoreover, biomarkers extracted from blood require uncomfortable blood draws, can be expensive to analyze, and again, are not always timely.<\/p>\nHistorically, continuous tracking of an individual\u2019s vital signs meant they had to be in a hospital. But that’s not true anymore. Digital biomarkers, collected from wearable sensors or through a device, offer healthcare providers an abundance of traditional and new data to precisely monitor and even predict a patient\u2019s disease trajectory.<\/p>\nWith cloud-based servers and sophisticated, yet inexpensive, sensors both on the body and off, patients can be monitored at home more effectively than in a hospital, especially when the sensor data is analyzed with artificial intelligence (AI) and machine-learning technology.<\/p>\nOpportunities for digital biomarkers<\/h2>\nA major opportunity for digital biomarkers is in addressing neurodegenerative diseases such as mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer\u2019s disease and Parkinson\u2019s disease.<\/p>\nNeurodegenerative disease is a major target for digital biomarker development due to a lack of easily accessible indicators that can help providers diagnose and manage these conditions. A definitive diagnosis for Alzheimer\u2019s disease today, for example, generally requires positron emission tomography (PET), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or other imaging studies, which are often"https:\/\/www.healthimaging.com\/topics\/practice-management\/jama-us-spends-most-healthcare-and-imaging-reason-why\">expensive<\/a> and"https:\/\/www.choosingwisely.org\/patient-resources\/alzheimers-disease-testing\/\">not always accurate or reliable<\/a>.<\/p>\nCost savings and other benefits<\/h2>\nDigital biomarkers have the potential to unlock significant value for healthcare providers, companies and, most importantly, patients and families, by detecting and slowing the development of these diseases.

Brown is Chief Visionary Officer and founder of Impossible Foods, a company at the forefront of making nutritious, delicious meat and dairy products from plants to satisfy meat lovers and address the environmental impact of animal farming. The idea for Impossible Foods came to Pat while he was on sabbatical from his position as an HHMI investigator and professor of biochemistry at the Stanford University School of Medicine. In reflecting on how he could use his training and experience to make the largest positive impact on the world, he realized there was a way to make delicious, affordable meat and dairy products, directly from plants \u2013 that would be better for the environment and for consumers. In 2011, Pat chose to devote himself full time to Impossible Foods. After receiving his BA, MD and PhD (in Biochemistry) at the University of Chicago, Pat completed a residency in pediatrics at Chicago\u2019s Children\u2019s Memorial Hospital. As a fellow with Mike Bishop and Harold Varmus, he defined the mechanism by which HIV and other retroviruses incorporate their genes into the genomes of the cells they infect. At Stanford, Pat and colleagues developed DNA microarrays \u2013 a new technology that made it possible to monitor the activity of all the genes in a genome \u2013 along with the first methods for analyzing, visualizing and interpreting global gene expression programs. He pioneered the use of gene expression patterns to classify cancers and improve prediction of their clinical course. He has also been a leader in making scientific and medical research results freely available to scientists, physicians and the public. With Harold Varmus, then Director of the National Institutes of Health, and Berkeley professor Michael Eisen, he founded the Public Library of Science, a nonprofit scientific publisher that has transformed the publishing industry by making scientific and medical research results freely available to the public.
