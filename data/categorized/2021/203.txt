The Snapchat maker revamped its developer platform policies on March 17, 2022, to ban anonymous apps and require developers to build friend-finding apps to limit access to users 18 or older. The policy changes were effective immediately and existing developers were given 30 days to come into compliance \u2014 a date that would have passed last month.<\/p>\nIt is now mid-May and some developers of the newly banned and restricted apps are not yet meeting Snap\u2019s new requirements.<\/p>\nSnap confirmed to TechCrunch a small number of apps were given extensions, including anonymous apps LMK and Send It. But others seemed to be working around Snap’s ban with their friend-finding apps marketed to users ages 12+, instead of the now required 18+. They got away with this by not actually using the SDK — something impossible to tell from their App Store marketing and screenshots which imply they’re directly integrated with Snap’s features. Another app had flown under the radar, continuing to operate in violation of the rules unless TechCrunch pointed it out, resulting in a belated ban. This lack of clarity on which apps are platform apps, and which are only pretending to be, could complicate things for Snap, which is engaged in litigation over bullying-related suicides. And like all social media, the company could be under new U.S. regulation related to child safety matters in the future, as well.<\/p>\n"embed breakout\">\n"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"Bd2UjCgxsR\">"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/05\/17\/snapchats-stricter-policies-for-anonymous-apps-and-friend-finders-arent-yet-fully-enforced\/\">Snapchat’s stricter policies for anonymous apps and friend finders aren’t yet fully enforced<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"“Snapchat’s stricter policies for anonymous apps and friend finders aren’t yet fully enforced” — TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/05\/17\/snapchats-stricter-policies-for-anonymous-apps-and-friend-finders-arent-yet-fully-enforced\/embed\/#?secret=e39VRJvFjG#?secret=Bd2UjCgxsR\" data-secret=\"Bd2UjCgxsR\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\nTwitter deal still a go… for now<\/h3>\nFirst,"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/05\/13\/elon-musk-twitter-deal-on-hold-spam\/\">Elon Musk tweeted<\/a> that the Twitter deal was “temporarily on hold” until Twitter could prove the percentage of spambots on its platform was actually less than 5%, as it reports.

Now, instead of asking users to agree to any subscription price increases, developers will be able to roll out a price increase with the user\u2019s explicit consent. The feature allows developers to simply inform customers they\u2019ll be charged more, but not require the customer to opt-in to the higher pricing.<\/p>\n"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/04\/05\/apple-pilot-tests-feature-that-allows-developers-to-automatically-charge-users-for-subscription-price-increases\/\">We first broke the news that Apple was pilot testing this program<\/a> last month, when it appeared Disney+ subscription customers had simply been told their price was increasing but weren\u2019t asked for their consent. Apple then confirmed this was the result of a \u201cnew commerce feature\u201d it planned to launch soon, which it said would be \u201cgreat for both developers and users.\u201d<\/p>\nApple\u2019s position is that this could save customers the hassle of having their subscriptions automatically canceled just because they didn\u2019t see the notification or email that asked them to opt in to the price increase.<\/p>\n\u201cThis has led to some services being unintentionally interrupted for users and they must take steps to resubscribe within the app, from Settings on iPhone and iPad, or in the App Store on Mac,\u201d the company explained in its announcement on Monday.<\/p>\nHowever, the flip side of this argument is that those same customers who would have missed the consent notification will likely be the same ones who would now miss the notification informing them their subscription will be increasing in price. There\u2019s also an argument here that this change could enable unscrupulous developers and scammers to better profit from their victims if Apple doesn’t carefully enforce the program rules.<\/p>\nCurrently, those state that developers can\u2019t increase prices more than once per year. The increase also can\u2019t exceed 50% of the subscription price, and the difference in price can\u2019t exceed $5 USD per period for non-annual subscriptions or $50 USD for annual subscriptions.<\/p>\nWeekly News<\/h1>\nPlatforms: Apple<\/h3>\n\nApple"https:\/\/9to5mac.com\/2022\/05\/19\/ios-15-6-beta-1-available-public-beta-testers\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">released<\/a> the first public betas of iOS 15.6,<\/strong>\u00a0iPadOS 15.6, tvOS 15.6,"https:\/\/www.imore.com\/how-download-watchos-8-public-beta\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">watchOS 8.7<\/a> and macOS 12.5.

They join for the opportunity to have an impact and to grow. And so in a lot of cases, it may be a more opportune time to take a chance in an early-stage company because you can focus on that long-term horizon, and you can get that opportunity to grow and have an impact,\u201d Hoffman told me.<\/p>\nFor employees, he said there will still be opportunities at good companies in any economic conditions, but attracting talent always comes down to creating a good place to work.<\/p>\n“Even in the tightest of economic environments \u2014 and we\u2019re not there yet \u2014 there\u2019s always going to be high demand for the best talent. Always. So the things that you need to do to attract, engage and retain these employees does not change,” he said.

nascent teams, given the firm has been among the earliest backers in a notable number of companies that have gone to raise ever-bigger rounds and higher valuations, including the now publicly traded companies DoorDash and Guardant Health.<\/p>\nOther startups to attract capital from Pear before nearly any other firm was aware of their existence include the deep-linking startup Branch, which

likely to see the valuations of its still-private portfolio companies slide downward — possibly by a lot — depending on how long this correction lasts.<\/p>\nHershenson, who joined TechCrunch for a mobility-focused event this week, noted on stage that startups are in for a bumpy ride, given how frothy the market had grown.<\/p>"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\nAsked if the"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/for-tech-startups-the-party-is-over-11652710330?mod=tech_lead_pos5\">startup party is over<\/a>, Hershenson answered: “Maybe for a little while it’s over . . .The problem is that the market was priced too high in 2021, and we’re all adjusting to that price change, and that changes how companies raise money.<\/p>\n“Everybody knows that the stock market is down a lot,” she’d said. “Software stocks are down in some cases 80%. [Meanwhile] if you’re a private company, and you were very lucky and you raised money in 2021, you may have gotten a multiple of 100x on your ARR. Today, those multiples are 10x or 20x. That means that if your company was $2 billion [at the time of your fundraise], your company is [now] worth $200 million.:<\/p>\nEven with a steep reset in prices, however, Pear’s success to date is undeniable. It’s also unlikely.<\/p>\nNozad, very famously, was earlier a rug dealer who insisted on toting rugs to his clients’ homes, where during the course of long conversations, they would learn about the rug and he would learn about their business. He eventually became a scout for his boss, and a trusted friend to some very powerful people.<\/p>\n\u201cHe has a good sniffer, and I trust the guy,\u201d\u00a0 Sequoia\u2019s Doug Leone"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/victoriabarret\/2012\/03\/21\/silicon-valleys-hottest-vc-is-a-rug-dealer\/?sh=3dfe6dbb31d5\">told Forbes<\/a> back in 2012. \u201cHe\u2019s like me, from the earth.\u201d Sequoia has, in fact, backed a number of companies that Pear has funded, including Guardant Health and DoorDash.<\/p>\nMeanwhile, his partner, Mar Hershenson, was also very much an outlier when the two struck out on their own. Despite founding several companies previously — one of which Nozad backed — and though she holds an M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Stanford University, she is a native of Spain and even more unusual in VC circles a decade ago, she is a woman who had not previously cut her teeth at someone else’s venture firm.<\/p>\nThat may not seem very notable today but in 2012, it put Hershenson in rare company.<\/p>\nAs for the team’s newest bets, Pear hosted an invite-only demo day earlier this week, coverage of which we’ll have for readers soon. (Unlike Y Combinator, the outfit holds a demo day each year for a comparatively limited number of companies — typically around 10.)<\/p>\nIn the meantime, some of its other recent checks have gone to Sudozi, a two-year-old Austin, Tex., startup that provides a SaaS platform to help enterprises improve their money management capabilities and that just this month announced a"https:\/\/venturebeat.com\/2022\/05\/12\/sudozi-nabs-4-3m-to-simplify-money-management-for-enterprises\/\">$4.3 million<\/a> seed round led by Pear.<\/p>\nPear also recently wrote a follow-on check to Osmind, a two-year-old, Bay Area-based startup that makes software to chart and update patient information and documents, with a focus on mental health.
