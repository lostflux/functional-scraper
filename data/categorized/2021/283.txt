The Snapchat maker revamped its developer platform policies on March 17, 2022, to ban anonymous apps and require developers to build friend-finding apps to limit access to users 18 or older. The policy changes were effective immediately and existing developers were given 30 days to come into compliance \u2014 a date that would have passed last month.<\/p>\nIt is now mid-May and some developers of the newly banned and restricted apps are not yet meeting Snap\u2019s new requirements.<\/p>\nSnap confirmed to TechCrunch a small number of apps were given extensions, including anonymous apps LMK and Send It. But others seemed to be working around Snap’s ban with their friend-finding apps marketed to users ages 12+, instead of the now required 18+. They got away with this by not actually using the SDK — something impossible to tell from their App Store marketing and screenshots which imply they’re directly integrated with Snap’s features. Another app had flown under the radar, continuing to operate in violation of the rules unless TechCrunch pointed it out, resulting in a belated ban. This lack of clarity on which apps are platform apps, and which are only pretending to be, could complicate things for Snap, which is engaged in litigation over bullying-related suicides. And like all social media, the company could be under new U.S. regulation related to child safety matters in the future, as well.<\/p>\n"embed breakout\">\n"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"Bd2UjCgxsR\">"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/05\/17\/snapchats-stricter-policies-for-anonymous-apps-and-friend-finders-arent-yet-fully-enforced\/\">Snapchat’s stricter policies for anonymous apps and friend finders aren’t yet fully enforced<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"“Snapchat’s stricter policies for anonymous apps and friend finders aren’t yet fully enforced” — TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/05\/17\/snapchats-stricter-policies-for-anonymous-apps-and-friend-finders-arent-yet-fully-enforced\/embed\/#?secret=e39VRJvFjG#?secret=Bd2UjCgxsR\" data-secret=\"Bd2UjCgxsR\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\nTwitter deal still a go… for now<\/h3>\nFirst,"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/05\/13\/elon-musk-twitter-deal-on-hold-spam\/\">Elon Musk tweeted<\/a> that the Twitter deal was “temporarily on hold” until Twitter could prove the percentage of spambots on its platform was actually less than 5%, as it reports.

Now, instead of asking users to agree to any subscription price increases, developers will be able to roll out a price increase with the user\u2019s explicit consent. The feature allows developers to simply inform customers they\u2019ll be charged more, but not require the customer to opt-in to the higher pricing.<\/p>\n"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/04\/05\/apple-pilot-tests-feature-that-allows-developers-to-automatically-charge-users-for-subscription-price-increases\/\">We first broke the news that Apple was pilot testing this program<\/a> last month, when it appeared Disney+ subscription customers had simply been told their price was increasing but weren\u2019t asked for their consent. Apple then confirmed this was the result of a \u201cnew commerce feature\u201d it planned to launch soon, which it said would be \u201cgreat for both developers and users.\u201d<\/p>\nApple\u2019s position is that this could save customers the hassle of having their subscriptions automatically canceled just because they didn\u2019t see the notification or email that asked them to opt in to the price increase.<\/p>\n\u201cThis has led to some services being unintentionally interrupted for users and they must take steps to resubscribe within the app, from Settings on iPhone and iPad, or in the App Store on Mac,\u201d the company explained in its announcement on Monday.<\/p>\nHowever, the flip side of this argument is that those same customers who would have missed the consent notification will likely be the same ones who would now miss the notification informing them their subscription will be increasing in price. There\u2019s also an argument here that this change could enable unscrupulous developers and scammers to better profit from their victims if Apple doesn’t carefully enforce the program rules.<\/p>\nCurrently, those state that developers can\u2019t increase prices more than once per year. The increase also can\u2019t exceed 50% of the subscription price, and the difference in price can\u2019t exceed $5 USD per period for non-annual subscriptions or $50 USD for annual subscriptions.<\/p>\nWeekly News<\/h1>\nPlatforms: Apple<\/h3>\n\nApple"https:\/\/9to5mac.com\/2022\/05\/19\/ios-15-6-beta-1-available-public-beta-testers\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">released<\/a> the first public betas of iOS 15.6,<\/strong>\u00a0iPadOS 15.6, tvOS 15.6,"https:\/\/www.imore.com\/how-download-watchos-8-public-beta\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">watchOS 8.7<\/a> and macOS 12.5.

This allows brands to tap into the power of the creator\u2019s platform and reach their fanbase, but then gives the brands themselves access to that audience \u2014 and the key metrics and analytics associated with their live event \u2014 directly on their own YouTube channel.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nFintech<\/h3>\n\nFTX US"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/05\/19\/crypto-exchange-ftx-expands-into-stock-trading-retail-investors\/\">plans to launch<\/a> FTX Stocks, a zero-commission stock trading feature available through the FTX mobile app,<\/strong> rolling out in the U.S. in the “coming months.” The news is particularly notable given that billionaire FTX US founder Sam Bankman-Fried recently acquired a 7.6% stake in Robinhood.<\/li>\nRobinhood will launch a standalone app that"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2022\/05\/17\/robinhood-to-let-users-hold-their-own-crypto-and-nfts-as-start-up-reaches-for-growth-beyond-stock-trading.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">lets users hold their own cryptocurrencies and NFTs<\/a>,<\/strong> putting it in direct competition with Coinbase and startups like MetaMask or Rainbow.

They join for the opportunity to have an impact and to grow.

Always. So the things that you need to do to attract, engage and retain these employees does not change,” he said.

for comment, cofounder Pejman Nozad emailed back, “I can’t comment!”<\/p>\nNozad and cofounder Mar Hershenson have long been first-stop for prominent early-stage investors that are looking to fund nascent teams, given the firm has been among the earliest backers in a notable number of companies that have gone to raise ever-bigger rounds and higher valuations, including the now publicly traded companies DoorDash and Guardant Health.<\/p>\nOther startups to attract capital from Pear before nearly any other firm was aware of their existence include the deep-linking startup Branch, which

likely to see the valuations of its still-private portfolio companies slide downward — possibly by a lot — depending on how long this correction lasts.<\/p>\nHershenson, who joined TechCrunch for a mobility-focused event this week, noted on stage that startups are in for a bumpy ride, given how frothy the market had grown.<\/p>"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\nAsked if the"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/for-tech-startups-the-party-is-over-11652710330?mod=tech_lead_pos5\">startup party is over<\/a>, Hershenson answered: “Maybe for a little while it’s over . . .The problem is that the market was priced too high in 2021, and we’re all adjusting to that price change, and that changes how companies raise money.<\/p>\n“Everybody knows that the stock market is down a lot,” she’d said. “Software stocks are down in some cases 80%. [Meanwhile] if you’re a private company, and you were very lucky and you raised money in 2021, you may have gotten a multiple of 100x on your ARR. Today, those multiples are 10x or 20x. That means that if your company was $2 billion [at the time of your fundraise], your company is [now] worth $200 million.:<\/p>\nEven with a steep reset in prices, however, Pear’s success to date is undeniable. It’s also unlikely.<\/p>\nNozad, very famously, was earlier a rug dealer who insisted on toting rugs to his clients’ homes, where during the course of long conversations, they would learn about the rug and he would learn about their business. He eventually became a scout for his boss, and a trusted friend to some very powerful people.<\/p>\n\u201cHe has a good sniffer, and I trust the guy,\u201d\u00a0 Sequoia\u2019s Doug Leone"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/victoriabarret\/2012\/03\/21\/silicon-valleys-hottest-vc-is-a-rug-dealer\/?sh=3dfe6dbb31d5\">told Forbes<\/a> back in 2012. \u201cHe\u2019s like me, from the earth.\u201d Sequoia has, in fact, backed a number of companies that Pear has funded, including Guardant Health and DoorDash.<\/p>\nMeanwhile, his partner, Mar Hershenson, was also very much an outlier when the two struck out on their own. Despite founding several companies previously — one of which Nozad backed — and though she holds an M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Stanford University, she is a native of Spain and even more unusual in VC circles a decade ago, she is a woman who had not previously cut her teeth at someone else’s venture firm.<\/p>\nThat may not seem very notable today but in 2012, it put Hershenson in rare company.<\/p>\nAs for the team’s newest bets, Pear hosted an invite-only demo day earlier this week, coverage of which we’ll have for readers soon. (Unlike Y Combinator, the outfit holds a demo day each year for a comparatively limited number of companies — typically around 10.)<\/p>\nIn the meantime, some of its other recent checks have gone to Sudozi, a two-year-old Austin, Tex., startup that provides a SaaS platform to help enterprises improve their money management capabilities and that just this month announced a"https:\/\/venturebeat.com\/2022\/05\/12\/sudozi-nabs-4-3m-to-simplify-money-management-for-enterprises\/\">$4.3 million<\/a> seed round led by Pear.<\/p>\nPear also recently wrote a follow-on check to Osmind, a two-year-old, Bay Area-based startup that makes software to chart and update patient information and documents, with a focus on mental health.

The Snapchat maker revamped its developer platform policies on March 17, 2022, to ban anonymous apps and require developers to build friend-finding apps to limit access to users 18 or older. The policy changes were effective immediately and existing developers were given 30 days to come into compliance \u2014 a date that would have passed last month.<\/p>\nIt is now mid-May and some developers of the newly banned and restricted apps are not yet meeting Snap\u2019s new requirements.<\/p>\nSnap confirmed to TechCrunch a small number of apps were given extensions, including anonymous apps LMK and Send It. But others seemed to be working around Snap’s ban with their friend-finding apps marketed to users ages 12+, instead of the now required 18+. They got away with this by not actually using the SDK — something impossible to tell from their App Store marketing and screenshots which imply they’re directly integrated with Snap’s features. Another app had flown under the radar, continuing to operate in violation of the rules unless TechCrunch pointed it out, resulting in a belated ban. This lack of clarity on which apps are platform apps, and which are only pretending to be, could complicate things for Snap, which is engaged in litigation over bullying-related suicides. And like all social media, the company could be under new U.S. regulation related to child safety matters in the future, as well.<\/p>\n"embed breakout\">\n"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"Bd2UjCgxsR\">"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/05\/17\/snapchats-stricter-policies-for-anonymous-apps-and-friend-finders-arent-yet-fully-enforced\/\">Snapchat’s stricter policies for anonymous apps and friend finders aren’t yet fully enforced<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"“Snapchat’s stricter policies for anonymous apps and friend finders aren’t yet fully enforced” — TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/05\/17\/snapchats-stricter-policies-for-anonymous-apps-and-friend-finders-arent-yet-fully-enforced\/embed\/#?secret=e39VRJvFjG#?secret=Bd2UjCgxsR\" data-secret=\"Bd2UjCgxsR\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\nTwitter deal still a go… for now<\/h3>\nFirst,"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/05\/13\/elon-musk-twitter-deal-on-hold-spam\/\">Elon Musk tweeted<\/a> that the Twitter deal was “temporarily on hold” until Twitter could prove the percentage of spambots on its platform was actually less than 5%, as it reports.

Now, instead of asking users to agree to any subscription price increases, developers will be able to roll out a price increase with the user\u2019s explicit consent. The feature allows developers to simply inform customers they\u2019ll be charged more, but not require the customer to opt-in to the higher pricing.<\/p>\n"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/04\/05\/apple-pilot-tests-feature-that-allows-developers-to-automatically-charge-users-for-subscription-price-increases\/\">We first broke the news that Apple was pilot testing this program<\/a> last month, when it appeared Disney+ subscription customers had simply been told their price was increasing but weren\u2019t asked for their consent. Apple then confirmed this was the result of a \u201cnew commerce feature\u201d it planned to launch soon, which it said would be \u201cgreat for both developers and users.\u201d<\/p>\nApple\u2019s position is that this could save customers the hassle of having their subscriptions automatically canceled just because they didn\u2019t see the notification or email that asked them to opt in to the price increase.<\/p>\n\u201cThis has led to some services being unintentionally interrupted for users and they must take steps to resubscribe within the app, from Settings on iPhone and iPad, or in the App Store on Mac,\u201d the company explained in its announcement on Monday.<\/p>\nHowever, the flip side of this argument is that those same customers who would have missed the consent notification will likely be the same ones who would now miss the notification informing them their subscription will be increasing in price. There\u2019s also an argument here that this change could enable unscrupulous developers and scammers to better profit from their victims if Apple doesn’t carefully enforce the program rules.<\/p>\nCurrently, those state that developers can\u2019t increase prices more than once per year. The increase also can\u2019t exceed 50% of the subscription price, and the difference in price can\u2019t exceed $5 USD per period for non-annual subscriptions or $50 USD for annual subscriptions.<\/p>\nWeekly News<\/h1>\nPlatforms: Apple<\/h3>\n\nApple"https:\/\/9to5mac.com\/2022\/05\/19\/ios-15-6-beta-1-available-public-beta-testers\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">released<\/a> the first public betas of iOS 15.6,<\/strong>\u00a0iPadOS 15.6, tvOS 15.6,"https:\/\/www.imore.com\/how-download-watchos-8-public-beta\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">watchOS 8.7<\/a> and macOS 12.5.

parental monitoring tools, though its app sees heavy use among younger users. At Snap’s"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/05\/03\/snap-unveils-a-cameo-partnership-new-ad-format-and-more-original-programming\/\">NewFronts presentation<\/a> to advertisers earlier this month, the company noted the Snapchat app now reaches more than 75% of 13-34-year-olds in over 20 countries, and 80% of the U.S. Gen Z population had watched at least one of its Snap Original shows.<\/p>\nAccording to new screenshots of Snapchat’s forthcoming Family Center shared with TechCrunch by the product intelligence firm"https:\/\/watchful.ai\/\">Watchful<\/a>, the new Family Center feature allows parents to see who their teen is friends with on the app. This is useful for parents because, unlike many social networks, Snapchat’s friend lists aren’t public. Parents will also have visibility into who their teen has chatted with over the past seven days — but not the contents of those conversations. The screenshots additionally explain that parents will be able to assist their teen in reporting abuse and harassment, if needed.<\/p>\n"attachment_2322048\" style=\"width: 339px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">"caption-attachment-2322048\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"vertical size-large wp-image-2322048\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/snapchat-family-center.jpg?w=329\" alt=\"\" width=\"329\" height=\"680\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/snapchat-family-center.jpg 608w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/snapchat-family-center.jpg?resize=73,150 73w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/snapchat-family-center.jpg?resize=145,300 145w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/snapchat-family-center.jpg?resize=329,680 329w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/snapchat-family-center.jpg?resize=24,50 24w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 329px) 100vw, 329px\" \/>"caption-attachment-2322048\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image Credits:<\/strong> Snapchat screenshot via Watchful<\/p><\/div><\/p>\nThe parental control feature works by allowing parents to invite their teen (or teens) to the new in-app Family Center in order to begin the monitoring. The recipient of that invitation has the option of either accepting or declining the invitation.<\/p>"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\nThis is, arguably, an appropriate approach to parental controls involving teens, as it respects their privacy. Instead of allowing parents to surreptitiously spy on their teens, it ensures the parent and child will instead have a conversation about parental monitoring, where they agree to a set of rules appropriate for their own household.<\/p>\nThe images provided by Watchful represent early designs of Snapchat’s feature, which is still in development and not yet live or being tested. We should note that products at this stage often change before their launch to the general public. That means the final product could look quite different. (The U.K. spelling of the word “Center,” too, suggests that we’re not seeing a global version of the Family Center product here.)<\/p>\n"attachment_2322047\" style=\"width: 346px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">"caption-attachment-2322047\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"vertical size-large wp-image-2322047\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/snap-family-center.jpg?w=336\" alt=\"\" width=\"336\" height=\"680\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/snap-family-center.jpg 618w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/snap-family-center.jpg?resize=74,150 74w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/snap-family-center.jpg?resize=148,300 148w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/snap-family-center.jpg?resize=336,680 336w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/snap-family-center.jpg?resize=25,50 25w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 336px) 100vw, 336px\" \/>"caption-attachment-2322047\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image Credits:<\/strong> Snapchat screenshot via Watchful<\/p><\/div><\/p>\nOther large social platforms have already launched their parental control features and other age-appropriate experiences for their younger users. Snap is running a little behind.<\/p>\nTikTok, for example, has"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/11\/17\/tiktok-expands-parental-controls-to-include-search-commenting-and-account-privacy\/\">continued to develop<\/a> its parental controls offerings following the"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/04\/16\/tiktok-to-launch-parental-controls-globally-disable-direct-messaging-for-users-under-16\/\">debut of its in-app Family Pairing tool<\/a> back in 2020. The tool allows parents to pair their TikTok account with a child’s in order to control the account’s privacy, whether it’s suggested to other TikTok users, whether the child can use search, and who, if anyone, can view, comment or interact with the child’s content, among other things. There’s also a toggle to put the account into an even safer mode for under-13 users.<\/p>\nYouTube also"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/24\/youtube-to-launch-parental-control-features-for-families-with-tweens-and-teens\/\">launched parental control features<\/a> into testing last year that allow parents to select between different levels of YouTube access for teen or tween users. And Instagram arrived even later with its"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/16\/instagram-rolls-out-new-safety-tools-for-parents\/\">new safety tools for parents<\/a>, also called Family Center, which didn’t roll out until March 2022. Its tools let parents monitor time spent on the app, who has followed the child’s account and more.<\/p>\nAlthough all platforms compete broadly in the social media space, they all operate a bit differently, which informs what type of parental control features are actually needed. In Snapchat’s case, minors on the app have to mutually accept each other as friends before they can begin messaging. Minors’ accounts also aren’t shown in search results or as friend suggestions to another user — unless they have friends in common. And minors are not able to have public profiles.

A report from"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/technology\/exclusive-tiktok-plans-big-push-into-gaming-conducting-tests-vietnam-sources-2022-05-19\/\">Reuters<\/a> today indicates the company is further investing in HTML5 games and has already begun tests. But we understand there may be more to TikTok’s gaming strategy than web-based gaming. It appears TikTok is also working on a LIVE mobile gaming feature that would allow creators to better engage fans while livestreaming.<\/p>\nReuters said TikTok planned to draw on parent company ByteDance’s suite of games, beginning with minigames that have simple mechanisms and a shorter playing time. It claimed tests had begun in Vietnam. But TikTok told TechCrunch that was inaccurate, saying that Vietnam gaming testing is not something it’s currently doing.<\/p>\nThe social video app’s move into HTML5 gaming was already known, as TikTok had previously announced its plans alongside its Zynga partnership last year. The two companies had teamed up to launch the HTML5 game Disco Loco 3D exclusively on TikTok. And at the time, TikTok confirmed it was"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/11\/09\/tiktok-ventures-into-mobile-gaming-initially-in-partnership-with-zynga\/\">already in discussions<\/a> with other game makers for similar deals, telegraphing a larger gaming expansion was still to come. TikTok says it doesn’t have any new partners to name on this front as of now.<\/p>\n"attachment_2231447\" style=\"width: 1210px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">"caption-attachment-2231447\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2231447 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/disco_loco_1200x675.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/disco_loco_1200x675.jpg 1200w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/disco_loco_1200x675.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/disco_loco_1200x675.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/disco_loco_1200x675.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/disco_loco_1200x675.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/disco_loco_1200x675.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" \/>"caption-attachment-2231447\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image Credits:<\/strong> Zynga<\/p><\/div><\/p>\nAhead of the Zynga deal, TikTok had also already launched its own game, Garden of Good, built in partnership with nonprofit Feeding America and focused on charitable fundraising. This one felt more like an experiment to see if TikTok users would play an in-app game.<\/p>\nWhile still a smaller effort today, gaming could grow to become a significant monetization tool for TikTok, if the games end up being ad-supported or later add paid components, like in-app purchases.<\/p>\nIn addition to its previously announced efforts to delve into HTML5 games, TechCrunch has also learned TikTok is looking to explore LIVE games in a separate effort.<\/p>"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\nAccording to an investigation by"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/03\/watchful-is-a-mobile-product-intelligence-startup-that-surfaces-unreleased-features\/\">mobile product intelligence firm<\/a>"https:\/\/www.watchful.ai\/\">Watchful<\/a>, based in Tel Aviv, TikTok is working to add minigames to LIVE videos in its app to enhance the livestreaming experience between creators and their fans.<\/p>\nOne LIVE game Watchful uncovered is called Draw & Guess, which is designed specifically to encourage interaction between creators and viewers. In this Pictionary-like game, players are given words that they then draw on the screen, and viewers try to guess what they’re drawing. The correct guesses are shown on the screen.<\/p>\nWatchful also noted the mobile gaming feature may allow screen-sharing, so creators could share their screen with viewers in real time, including their camera, audio, notifications and other alerts. Their games could be shown in either landscape mode or portrait mode, the firm said.<\/p>\nWhile today, a handful of reverse engineers publicly share details of unannounced, still-in-development features they find in popular consumer apps, Watchful has productized this type of investigation and enhanced it with technology. The company uses a combination of computer vision and flow analysis to identify and emulate app changes. Its differential analysis engine compares application versions using real user data and proprietary computer vision algorithms, it says. The studies are also backed by the firm’s mobile device labs deployed around the world.<\/p>\nReached for comment, TikTok did not have anything more to share about the LIVE gaming efforts but told us it was a totally unrelated development from the HTML5 games Reuters had described.<\/p>\nGames aren’t the only way TikTok is looking to enhance the TikTok LIVE Platform.<\/p>\nWatchful also flagged another in-development feature that feels like a cross between a game and a virtual gifting experience. It allows users to add a “Treasure Box” to LIVE videos which doles out coins after a timer is up to a random set of users.<\/p>\n"attachment_2321755\" style=\"width: 307px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">"caption-attachment-2321755\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"vertical wp-image-2321755\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/eb581cd3-d69e-11ec-b9f1-097eea4a6a77.png?w=421\" alt=\"\" width=\"297\" height=\"480\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/eb581cd3-d69e-11ec-b9f1-097eea4a6a77.png 718w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/eb581cd3-d69e-11ec-b9f1-097eea4a6a77.png?resize=93,150 93w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/eb581cd3-d69e-11ec-b9f1-097eea4a6a77.png?resize=186,300 186w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/eb581cd3-d69e-11ec-b9f1-097eea4a6a77.png?resize=421,680 421w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/eb581cd3-d69e-11ec-b9f1-097eea4a6a77.png?resize=31,50 31w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 297px) 100vw, 297px\" \/>"caption-attachment-2321755\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image Credits:<\/strong> TikTok app image via Watchful<\/p><\/div><\/p>\nIt found TikTok was working on the in-app shopping experience, TikTok Shop, which is offered today in Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, mainland China, Hong Kong and the U.K. Here, TikTok appears to be looking at adding a shopping bag icon to LIVE shopping videos which, when clicked, opens up a window where viewers can browse through available products with the option to click to add them to a cart for immediate purchase.<\/p>\n"attachment_2321756\" style=\"width: 295px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">"caption-attachment-2321756\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"vertical wp-image-2321756\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/3a0e254a-d522-11ec-b53b-3dc16094bfe4.png?w=415\" alt=\"\" width=\"285\" height=\"467\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/3a0e254a-d522-11ec-b53b-3dc16094bfe4.png 710w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/3a0e254a-d522-11ec-b53b-3dc16094bfe4.png?resize=91,150 91w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/3a0e254a-d522-11ec-b53b-3dc16094bfe4.png?resize=183,300 183w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/3a0e254a-d522-11ec-b53b-3dc16094bfe4.png?resize=415,680 415w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/3a0e254a-d522-11ec-b53b-3dc16094bfe4.png?resize=30,50 30w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 285px) 100vw, 285px\" \/>"caption-attachment-2321756\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image Credits:<\/strong> TikTok app image via Watchful<\/p><\/div><\/p>\nTikTok declined to comment on these other LIVE platform plans.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"TikTok is already one of the world’s fastest-growing social media platforms, where it’s even overtaken YouTube on watch time in select markets and sports over 1 billion monthly active users.

"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/11\/01\/whatsapp-brings-its-business-api-to-the-cloud-to-speed-adoption\/\">Introduced into beta testing<\/a> last November, the new developer tool is a cloud-based version of the WhatsApp Business API — WhatsApp’s"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/08\/01\/whatsapp-business-api\/\">first revenue-generating enterprise product<\/a> — but hosted on parent company Meta’s infrastructure.<\/p>\nThe company had been building out its Business API platform over the past several years as one of the key ways the otherwise free messaging app would make money. Businesses pay WhatsApp on a per-message basis, with rates that vary based on the region and number of messages sent. As of late last year, tens of thousands of businesses were set up on the non-cloud-based version of the Business API including brands like Vodafone, Coppel, Sears Mexico, BMW, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Iberia Airlines, Itau Brazil, iFood, Bank Mandiri and others. This on-premise version of the API is free to use.<\/p>\nThe cloud-based version, however, aims to attract a market of smaller businesses and reduces the integration time from weeks to only minutes, the company had said. It is also free.<\/p>\nBusinesses integrate the API with their back-end systems, where WhatsApp communication is usually just one part of their messaging and communication strategy. They may also want to direct their communications to SMS, other messaging apps, emails and more. Typically, businesses would work with a solutions provider like Zendeks or Twilio to help facilitate these integrations. Providers during the cloud API beta tests had included Zendesk in the U.S., Take in Brazil and MessageBird in the E.U.<\/p>\nDuring Meta’s messaging-focused"https:\/\/metaconversations.me\/\">“Conversations” live event<\/a> today, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced the global, public availability of the cloud-based platform, now called the WhatsApp Cloud API.<\/p>\n“The best business experiences meet people where they are. Already more than 1 billion users connect with a business account across our messaging services every week. They’re reaching out for help, to find products and services, and to buy anything from big-ticket items to everyday goods. And today, I am excited to announce that we’re opening WhatsApp to any business of any size around the world with WhatsApp Cloud API,” he said.<\/p>\nHe said the company believes the new API will help businesses, both big and small, be able to connect with more people.<\/p>"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\nIn addition to helping businesses and developers get set up faster than with the on-premise version, Meta says the Cloud API will help partners to eliminate costly server expenses and help them provide customers with quick access to new features as they arrive.<\/p>\nSome businesses may choose to forgo the API and use the dedicated WhatsApp Business app instead. Launched in 2018, the WhatsApp Business App is aimed at smaller businesses that want to establish an official presence on WhatsApp\u2019s service and connect with customers. It provides a set of features that wouldn’t be available to users of the free WhatsApp messaging app, like support automated quick replies, greeting messages, FAQs, away messaging, statistics and more.<\/p>\nToday, Meta is also introducing new power features for its WhatsApp Business app that will be offered for a fee — like the ability to manage chats across up to 10 devices. The company will also provide new customizable WhatsApp click-to-chat links that help businesses attract customers across their online presence, including of course, Meta’s other applications like Facebook and Instagram.<\/p>\nThese will be a part of a forthcoming Premium service for WhatsApp Business app users. Further details, including pricing, will be announced at a later date.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"WhatsApp is continuing its push into the business market with today’s news it’s launching the WhatsApp Cloud API to all businesses worldwide.

to"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/07\/21\/youtube-to-pilot-test-shopping-from-livestreams-with-select-creators\/\">shop directly from livestreams<\/a> hosted by creators. Now, it’s furthering that investment with new features for live shopping experiences. At yesterday’s YouTube Brandcast event, where the company pitched itself to advertisers as a"https:\/\/www.tubefilter.com\/2022\/05\/17\/youtube-brandcast-upfronts-tv-mr-beast\/\">better place for their TV ad dollars<\/a>, YouTube teased upcoming features that it claimed would make it easier for viewers to discover and buy from brands.<\/p>\nThe company touted its forthcoming tools as offering advertisers a better way to engage viewers and make connections with their audience.<\/p>\nOne new feature, explained YouTube, will allow two creators to go live at the same time to co-host a single live shopping stream. This could effectively double the draw for the event, as each creator would bring their own fanbase to the stream.<\/p>\nThis feature arrives shortly after YouTube"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=aIBCfaI-LwQ\">in March announced<\/a> a pilot program called “Go Live Together,” a new mobile collaborative streaming feature that would enable creators to invite guests to their livestream with a link before going live together. This trial suggested YouTube had its eye on developing tools to better power joint livestreams — just as it’s now planning to introduce with its upcoming two-person live shopping streams. The addition could also make YouTube more competitive with Instagram, which launched the ability for"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/01\/instagram-launches-live-rooms-for-live-broadcasts-with-up-to-four-creators\/\">creators to go live with up to three people<\/a> last year.<\/p>\nIn addition to leveraging creators to build an audience for a live shopping event, YouTube’s shopping livestreams platform also offers other tools specifically designed to drive sales. The brand-integrated shopping experience actually allows viewers to"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/07\/21\/youtube-to-pilot-test-shopping-from-livestreams-with-select-creators\/\">shop the products shown in the video<\/a> by tapping on a built-in “view products” button that then brings up a list of items featured by the creators.<\/p>\nThe company says its new two-person live shopping feature will roll out sometime later this year.<\/p>\nAnother upcoming option announced at Brandcast is something YouTube calls “live redirects.”<\/p>"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\nIn this case, creators will be able to start a shopping livestream on their channel, then redirect their audience over to a brand’s channel for fans to keep watching. This allows brands to tap into the power of the creator’s platform and reach their fanbase, but then gives the brands themselves access to that audience — and the key metrics and analytics associated with their live event — directly on their own YouTube channel. This will also roll out sometime this year, says YouTube, but didn’t provide a timeframe.<\/p>\nYouTube’s announcements follow the"https:\/\/www.marketingdive.com\/news\/livestream-shopping-poised-grow-amid-demand-immersive-experiences\/616501\/\">broader growth<\/a> of the live e-commerce market in the U.S. — a trend inspired by the livestream shopping activity surging in China, where streamers can pull"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2021\/11\/16\/chinese-livestreamers-can-rake-in-billions-of-dollars-in-hours-how-long-will-it-last.html\">in billions of dollars in a matter of hours<\/a>.

identify the most popular parts of a video they’re watching, along with other changes for its video player. The company says it’s adding a graph that people can use to easily locate and watch the most replayed parts of a video — something that could be particularly helpful for longer videos or those that haven’t broken down their various sections using either timestamps or video chapters.<\/p>\nThe feature was previously available as an experiment that YouTube Premium subscribers could access from"http:\/\/youtube.com\/new\">YouTube.com\/New<\/a>, but it will now become available to all YouTube users, both free and Premium, across desktop, iOS and Android platforms.<\/p>\nWhile creators will often segment their longer videos into chapters or link to select parts via timestamps, the new graph aims to make it possible for users to scrub through any YouTube video to quickly find the most interesting parts. These segments may or not always correlate to where chapters or timestamps would be located, either — particularly in the case of certain video segments going viral, for example.<\/p>\nIn addition, the feature could help point users more to the useful parts of tutorial videos, or to the segment that has the most action — like the most watched bit of footage from a gamer’s video.<\/p>\nYouTube viewers will be able to now see this subtle gray graph as they scrub through the video using the red playback progress bar. If the graph is high, then that part of the video has been replayed often, says YouTube. The video thumbnail that appears will also indicate when you’ve hit the segment that is the “Most replayed.”<\/p>\n"attachment_2320895\" style=\"width: 324px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">"caption-attachment-2320895\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"vertical size-large wp-image-2320895\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/youtube-graph.png?w=314\" alt=\"\" width=\"314\" height=\"680\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/youtube-graph.png 738w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/youtube-graph.png?resize=69,150 69w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/youtube-graph.png?resize=138,300 138w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/youtube-graph.png?resize=314,680 314w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/youtube-graph.png?resize=708,1536 708w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/youtube-graph.png?resize=23,50 23w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px\" \/>"caption-attachment-2320895\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image Credits:<\/strong> YouTube<\/p><\/div><\/p>\nAlongside this launch, YouTube is also rolling out support for video chapters — the segmenting tool first launched in May 2020 — to smart TVs and gaming consoles. Chapters allow users to jump forward to a particular section of a video or easily rewatch that section. Since launching, YouTube has made it possible for chapters to be automatically generated and notes they’ve now been added to some 20 million videos to date.<\/p>"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\nAnother newly added feature called Single Loop will now allow users to put an individual video on endless repeat. To access this feature, you’ll select the option from the same menu where you can adjust the video quality, turn on captions and more.<\/p>\nAlso, in full-screen mode, a new panel will now appear to display information about the video — like the video description, video chapters and comments. Users will be able to access quick action buttons here to like, dislike, comment, share or add a video to a playlist directly from full-screen mode.<\/p>\n"attachment_2320894\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">"caption-attachment-2320894\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2320894\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/heatseeker.gif?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"334\" \/>"caption-attachment-2320894\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image Credits:<\/strong> YouTube<\/p><\/div><\/p>\nFinally, YouTube teased it will “soon” begin another new experiment that will allow users to seek the exact moment in a video that they want to watch.

today is introducing a new feature that it says will be the first iteration of its creator crediting tools that allow creators to directly tag and credit others using a new button during the publishing process. This button lets creators credit all sorts of inspiration for their content, including dances, jokes, viral sounds and more — and will help TikTok viewers discover the original creators behind the latest trend by tapping on the credit from the video’s caption.<\/p>\nLarger creators lifting ideas from smaller ones is an issue that’s not limited to TikTok. But as one of the largest social apps on the market, particularly among a younger Gen Z to millennial demographic, how it approaches the issue of creator recognition matters.<\/p>\nTo that end, TikTok says it’s now rolling out a new feature that will allow users to add a credit as part of the publishing process on the app.<\/p>\n"attachment_2320818\" style=\"width: 324px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">"caption-attachment-2320818\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"vertical size-large wp-image-2320818\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/popup-FINAL.jpg?w=314\" alt=\"\" width=\"314\" height=\"680\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/popup-FINAL.jpg 1500w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/popup-FINAL.jpg?resize=69,150 69w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/popup-FINAL.jpg?resize=139,300 139w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/popup-FINAL.jpg?resize=768,1663 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/popup-FINAL.jpg?resize=314,680 314w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/popup-FINAL.jpg?resize=709,1536 709w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/popup-FINAL.jpg?resize=946,2048 946w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/popup-FINAL.jpg?resize=23,50 23w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px\" \/>"caption-attachment-2320818\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image Credits:<\/strong> TikTok<\/p><\/div><\/p>\nTo access the feature, users will tap on a new “video” icon on the posting page after creating or editing their own video.

Many of these unknown creators had helped kick off TikTok’s biggest dance trends in"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2020\/02\/13\/style\/the-original-renegade.html\">years past,<\/a> like the Renegade, Backpack Kid or Shiggy. And many were creators of color, who saw their dances go viral after more famous TikTokers would perform their moves without tagging them as the inspiration. This issue came to a head when"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2020\/02\/13\/style\/the-original-renegade.html\">The New York Times in 2020<\/a> reported on the original creator of the Renegade, then a 14-year-old Atlanta teen, Jalaiah Harmon, who hadn’t received credit for her work after TikTok’s largest creator, Charli D’Amelio, performed her dance for her millions of fans, helping her to further grow her already outsized celebrity status.<\/p>\nThe following year, a similar controversy made headlines after TikTok star"https:\/\/www.insider.com\/jimmy-fallon-addison-rae-tiktok-dance-black-creators-2021-3\">Addison Rae went on “The Tonight Show”<\/a> where she taught host Jimmy Fallon a number of popular TikTok dances. Meanwhile, the dances’ original creators, many of whom are Black, remained uncredited in the segment. Later, a number of Black creators"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2021\/06\/25\/style\/black-tiktok-strike.html\">went on strike<\/a> as part of a viral campaign to call attention to the issue of creator credits by refusing to choreograph a dance to Megan Thee Stallion\u2019s latest single.<\/p>\nD’Amelio and some other creators have since begun to handwrite dance credits in their video descriptions, often using the shorthand “dc” for dance credit followed by a tag pointing to the username of the creator.

However, it still relies on user adoption to work. If a creator wants to lift ideas without credit, they could simply not use the feature.<\/p>\n“It’s important to see a culture of credit take shape across the digital landscape and to support underrepresented creators in being properly credited and celebrated for their work,” said Chikumbu. “We’re eager to see how these new creator crediting tools inspire more creativity and encourage trend attribution across the global TikTok community.”<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"After years of stolen memes and uncredited dance trends, TikTok today is introducing a new feature that it says will be the first iteration of its creator crediting tools that allow creators to directly tag and credit others using a new button during the publishing process.

Its brand studio and agency have relationships with companies like Amazon, Ford, Google, Intel, Mattel, P&G, Target and T-Mobile.<\/p>\nThe acquisition offers ATTN: scale, capital and expertise to accelerate its growth, Candle Media said in a press release.

in costs as its top-line growth has slowed down.<\/p>\nA Netflix representative wrote in an emailed statement, \u201cAs we explained on earnings, our slowing revenue growth means we are also having to slow our cost growth as a company. So sadly, we are letting around 150 employees go today, mostly U.S.-based. These changes are primarily driven by business needs rather than individual performance, which makes them especially tough as none of us want to say goodbye to such great colleagues. We’re working hard to support them through this very difficult transition.\u201d<\/p>\n"https:\/\/deadline.com\/2022\/05\/netflix-layoffs-us-employees-1235026085\/\">Deadline<\/a> had reported that some of those let go were in creative, including in original content. Reportedly, directors from the original series area, such as Sebastian Gibbs and Negin Salmasi, were among those let go, its report said.<\/p>\nSeparately, TechCrunch learned that there have been some changes to animated projects, which could impact around 70 employees in the animation division. These were not included in the 150 figure.<\/p>\nWe asked Netflix about the allegations shared on Twitter that the layoffs had targeted social channels designed to bring marginalized viewers to the service. One such"https:\/\/twitter.com\/freeblackgirl\/status\/1526674760674861056\">tweet<\/a> had named channels like Strong Black Lead, Golden, Most, and Con Todo as being impacted by this headcount reduction.<\/p>\nNetflix clarified thatnone<\/em> of its social channels — including those mentioned on Twitter and others (eg. Geeked, Netflix Family, Netflix is a Joke, etc.) — would be shut down. The company said those channels would continue to be staffed and run by full-time Netflix employees as they had before.<\/p>\nWhat did happen, however, is that Netflix decided not to renew contracts with select agencies that it previously used to source contractors for its publishing and social arms. With those deals terminated, there was a reduction in the number of contractors working across all Netflix’s social channels. These contractors are not included in Netflix’s count of 150 roles terminated as that figure is specifically related to Netflix’s employee numbers. As such, the layoffs have not changed Netflix’s makeup from a DEI perspective, as its reporting here looks at full-time staff. The company says people of color continue to make up about 50% of its U.S. and Canadian full-time workforce and women make up around 48% of staff.<\/p>"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\nThe company declined to say how many contractors were impacted by the agency contract terminations.<\/p>\nAfter publication, the Netflix Twitter account"https:\/\/twitter.com\/netflix\/status\/1527003485304197122?s=21&t=1plZKutQMT5x8r17O1MQcQ\">announced<\/a> that none of the social channels were closing and would continue with “voices celebrating — and from — those communities.”<\/p>\n"embed breakout\">\n"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Your favorite Black, LGBTQ+, API, and Latinx stories will always have a home on"https:\/\/twitter.com\/strongblacklead?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@strongblacklead<\/a>"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Most?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Most<\/a>"https:\/\/twitter.com\/netflixgolden?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@netflixgolden<\/a> &"https:\/\/twitter.com\/contodonetflix?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@contodonetflix<\/a>, with voices celebrating – and from – those communities.

In particular, Pulse was attracted to Lounge’s ideas around team-building activities for remote workers.<\/p>\nThat was only a subset of what Lounge had offered, however. Its service was a more expansive platform with features like message boards, audio chat, group audio and visual representations of typical corporate office spaces — like employee desks, conference rooms and even break rooms. On top of this, it had built features designed to help remote workers connect and get to know one another, like photo-sharing tools and support for company-wide events — like steps or meditation challenges, for example.<\/p>\n"embed breakout\">\n"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"hWyFeXtPW4\">"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/09\/22\/lounges-new-app-aims-to-reimagine-the-office-for-the-remote-work-era\/\">Lounge’s new app aims to reimagine the office for the remote work era<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"“Lounge’s new app aims to reimagine the office for the remote work era” — TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/09\/22\/lounges-new-app-aims-to-reimagine-the-office-for-the-remote-work-era\/embed\/#?secret=pyauYlG1mr#?secret=hWyFeXtPW4\" data-secret=\"hWyFeXtPW4\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\nAccording to Lounge CEO Alex Kwon, despite his startup’s unique features, it struggled against the lock-in and network effect of mainstream remote work platforms, like Slack and Microsoft Teams. But the final bullet was Slack’s introduction of Huddle, its own"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/30\/slacks-new-video-and-voice-tools-are-nod-to-changing-face-of-work\/\">lightweight audio networking feature<\/a> that effectively took aim at one of Lounge’s biggest selling points — drop-in voice chats.<\/p>\nInitially, Lounge decided to pivot to focus more on asynchronous team-building activities with deeper Slack integration.<\/p>\nKwon says Singh later reached out to him and explained how Pulse aimed to become a platform for displaying the status of each team member right inside Slack, where they’re already working — as opposed to having employees use a whole new platform like Lounge. Pulse was also looking to expand its solution to other workplace apps, like Microsoft Teams, Google Workspace and even Discord. Both parties agreed that establishing team-building activities as a social layer for this existing offering could make sense. It also served Lounge’s original vision to make remote teams feel closer.<\/p>"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n“Raj is an experienced entrepreneur in the B2B space with a previous exit to Salesforce, so the acquisition conversation became a natural next step for us,” notes Kwon.<\/p>\nPulse aims to use Lounge’s asynchronous team-building activities like its Steps challenge and Team photos feature as the social roadmap for Pulse’s ambient status updater right inside Slack, Kwon says. You could imagine, then, how companywide team-building challenges could be turned into Slack status updates the same way Pulse today updates your status based on the apps you use — like Zoom, Google Meet, Skype, Slack Huddles, etc. — and your calendar, working hours and more.<\/p>\nAs a result of the acquisition, Kwon is the only Lounge member joining Pulse, and only as a part-time product adviser — a signal the acquisition was more about the tech than talent.<\/p>\nDeal terms weren’t revealed but we understand it to be more stock than cash, implying a smaller exit.<\/p>\nLounge had raised $1.2 million in funding from investors including Unusual Ventures, Hustle Fund, Translink, Unpopular Ventures and other angels.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Lounge, a team communication startup that was looking to reimagine the future of work with features designed for remote and distributed workforces, has now found an exit after Slack entered its same market last year with competitive voice and video tools.

Alongside the"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/05\/16\/ios-15-5-apple-cash-update-send-request-money-wallet\/\">launch of the iOS 15.5 update<\/a>, Apple"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/news\/?id=tpgp89cl\">introduced<\/a> a new set of rules to govern auto-renewing subscriptions on the App Store. Now, instead of asking users to agree to any subscription price increases, developers will be able to roll out a price increase without the user’s explicit consent. The feature feels somewhat anti-consumer, as it allows developers to simply inform customers they’ll be charged more, not require the customer to opt-in to the higher pricing.<\/p>\nTechCrunch first broke the news that Apple was"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/04\/05\/apple-pilot-tests-feature-that-allows-developers-to-automatically-charge-users-for-subscription-price-increases\/\">pilot testing this program<\/a> last month, when it appeared Disney+ subscription customers had simply been told their price was increasing but weren’t asked for their consent. Apple then confirmed this was the result of a “new commerce feature” it planned to launch soon, which it said would be “great for both developers and users.”<\/p>\nIt’s certainly great for developers! For users, maybe not so much.<\/p>\nApple’s position on the matter is that it could save consumers the hassle of having their subscriptions automatically canceled just because they didn’t see the notification or email that asked them to opt in to the price increase.<\/p>\n“This has led to some services being unintentionally interrupted for users and they must take steps to resubscribe within the app, from Settings on iPhone and iPad, or in the App Store on Mac,” the company"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/news\/?id=tpgp89cl\">explained<\/a> in its announcement on Monday.<\/p>\nHowever, the flip side of this argument is that those same customers who would have missed the consent notification will likely be the same ones who would now miss the notification informing them their subscription will be increasing in price.<\/p>\nThese may include customers who don’t keep a close eye on their inboxes and tend to miss Apple’s emails; those who keep their iOS notifications silenced or aggregated into summaries using Apple’s own notification management tools; as well as those who so infrequently use a particular subscription-based app that they would likely rather have their subscription lapse than be automatically opted in to paying more.<\/p>"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\nThere’s also an argument here that this change could enable unscrupulous developers and scammers to better profit from their victims. Although Apple reviews apps for adherence to its App Store policies as part of its vetting process, it has"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/10\/15\/sneaky-subscriptions-are-plaguing-the-app-store\/\">for years<\/a>"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2021\/4\/21\/22385859\/apple-app-store-scams-fraud-review-enforcement-top-grossing-kosta-eleftheriou\">struggled<\/a> to rein in subscription scams.

Apple demurred, and insisted that it had invested millions in hardening its App Store’s security.<\/p>\nBut today, subscription scams continue to persist. And, unfortunately, this new policy change could increase the damage done by those bad actors.<\/p>\nApple, at least, built in a few protections to the new program so the feature can’t be egregiously abused. It says developers can’t increase prices more than once per year. The increase also can’t exceed 50% of the subscription price, and the difference in price can’t exceed $5 USD per period for non-annual subscriptions or $50 USD for annual subscriptions. It also must be permitted by local laws.<\/p>\nThe company also says users will be warned of the price increase in advance via email, push notification and a message within the app. And Apple will notify users of how to view, manage and cancel subscriptions if they don’t want to pay more. It’s unclear how Apple will police this program to ensure scammers aren’t increasing prices more frequently than permitted or at higher rates that would otherwise require consent. Hopefully, Apple will keep a strict eye on the apps adopting this option.<\/p>\nApple may have chosen to enact the policy to better cater to the larger app developers who are pushing for new regulations that would allow them to collect subscription payments without having to use Apple’s own in-app purchasing system, which requires a rev share with the tech giant. These companies want to control their own customer relationships and manage their own payments — control that could include doling out the occasional price increase without having to regain the consent of their entire subscription base each time.<\/p>\nWhile some developers may welcome Apple’s latest change to save themselves the trouble of having to gather consent for smaller price changes, others are likely worried about the potential for abuse — particularly because that abuse could have long-term negative impacts on consumers’ willingness to subscribe to apps in the first place.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Surely, this won’t be abused?

apps"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/17\/following-suicides-and-lawsuits-snapchat-restricts-apps-building-on-its-platform-with-new-policies\/\">announced in March<\/a>. The Snapchat maker revamped its developer platform policies on March 17, 2022, to ban anonymous apps and require developers to build friend-finding apps to limit access to users 18 or older. The policy changes were effective immediately and existing developers were given 30 days to come into compliance — a date that would have passed last month.<\/p>\nIt is now mid-May and some developers of the newly banned and restricted apps are not yet meeting Snap’s new requirements, we’ve found.<\/p>\nSnap says only a small number of developers asked for and were granted additional time to bring apps into compliance, as they worked in good faith to make the necessary changes. But it may be difficult for consumers to tell which apps are compliant, which are skirting the new rules and which are marketing Snap Kit integrations that they actually don’t have.<\/p>\nFor example, one of the apps offered an extension is Sendit, the anonymous Q&A app that"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/08\/03\/anonymous-snapchat-app-sendit-surges-with-3-5m-installs-after-snap-bans-yolo-and-lmk\/\">surged to the top of the App Store<\/a> last year after Snap"https:\/\/www.latimes.com\/business\/technology\/story\/2021-05-11\/snapchat-suspends-yolo-lmk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">suspended<\/a> other top anonymous Q&A apps, YOLO and LMK. Those latter two apps had been banned from Snap’s platform after the company was sued by a mother of a teen who died by suicide after being bullied via those tools. This year, Snap was named in a"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/nation\/2022\/01\/22\/selena-rodriguez-suicide-meta-snap-lawsuit\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">second lawsuit<\/a>, alongside Meta, related to an alleged lack of safeguards across social media platforms which a mother says contributed to her 11-year-old’s suicide.<\/p>\nSnap has since conducted a review of its platform policies with a focus on potential child safety issues related to third-party apps that integrate with Snapchat’s features and functionality.<\/p>\nThis culminated in the"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/17\/following-suicides-and-lawsuits-snapchat-restricts-apps-building-on-its-platform-with-new-policies\/\">new policies<\/a> that were introduced in March which impact apps that build using the"https:\/\/kit.snapchat.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Snap Kit platform.<\/a> This suite of developer tools allows third-party apps to offer sign-in with Snapchat for user verification, or utilize Snapchat features like Snap’s Camera, Bitmoji, Stories and more.<\/p>\n"embed breakout\">\n"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"oWkFug5ML7\">"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/08\/03\/anonymous-snapchat-app-sendit-surges-with-3-5m-installs-after-snap-bans-yolo-and-lmk\/\">Sendit gains 3.5M downloads after Snapchat suspends top anonymous apps YOLO and LMK<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"“Sendit gains 3.5M downloads after Snapchat suspends top anonymous apps YOLO and LMK” — TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/08\/03\/anonymous-snapchat-app-sendit-surges-with-3-5m-installs-after-snap-bans-yolo-and-lmk\/embed\/#?secret=ei3ySNedDq#?secret=oWkFug5ML7\" data-secret=\"oWkFug5ML7\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\nAt the time Snap"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/17\/following-suicides-and-lawsuits-snapchat-restricts-apps-building-on-its-platform-with-new-policies\/\">announced<\/a> its new policies, it said the changes would impact a small subset of its over 1,500 developers in its wider community. Around 2% would be impacted by the ban on anonymous messaging apps, Snap said, and another 3% would be impacted by the new requirement to age-gate friend-finding apps.<\/p>\nSendit appeared to be non-compliant as it was not utilizing a required feature, as specified"https:\/\/docs.snap.com\/snap-kit\/creative-kit\/Tutorials\/ios\/#identity-web-view\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">by Snap’s own developer documentation<\/a>.<\/p>\nHere, Snap offered an example of how something called “Identity Web View” could be adopted by third-party developers who today use Snap Kit to build anonymous Q&A apps. The feature would allow anonymous Q&A apps to come into compliance with the new policies as it will require apps to present a new modal to users that they must click to send their Bitmoji avatar URL and abbreviated Display Name to the third-party application. Then, they can use the third-party app to post their question — but no longer anonymously. Essentially, it allows Q&A apps to continue to function in much the same way as before, but without the potential dangers of anonymous bullying — the user is identified.<\/p>\nSendit, however, doesn’t currently use this modal even though it’s the example shown in the developer documentation screenshot. But Snap says the developer asked for more time to make these changes, which was granted. Snap believes the app, currently No. 8 in the Lifestyle section on the App Store, will soon come into compliance.<\/p>\n"attachment_2319275\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">"caption-attachment-2319275\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2319275\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/snap-ux-for-compliance.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"506\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/snap-ux-for-compliance.jpg 1676w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/snap-ux-for-compliance.jpg?resize=150,112 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/snap-ux-for-compliance.jpg?resize=300,223 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/snap-ux-for-compliance.jpg?resize=768,572 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/snap-ux-for-compliance.jpg?resize=680,506 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/snap-ux-for-compliance.jpg?resize=1536,1144 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/snap-ux-for-compliance.jpg?resize=50,37 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/>"caption-attachment-2319275\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image Credits:<\/strong> Snap, via"https:\/\/docs.snap.com\/snap-kit\/creative-kit\/Tutorials\/ios\/#adding-captions-stickers-or-url-attachments-to-photos-or-videos\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Snapchat Developer documentation<\/a><\/p><\/div><\/p>\nOther third-party apps also appear to be still operating as usual and, at first glance, seem to not be in compliance with Snap’s new policies.<\/p>\nApps skirting the rules — or operating outside them?<\/h3>\nBut this is where things get more tricky — some apps have been granted an extension, some are routing around Snap’s rules and others are marketing themselves as Snapchat-connected apps when they’re not actually using the SDK.<\/p>\nFor instance, the app"https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/lmk-anonymous-polls\/id1465092216\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">LMK<\/a> — to be clear, adifferent<\/em> LMK than the original LMK app that was"https:\/\/www.latimes.com\/business\/technology\/story\/2021-05-11\/snapchat-suspends-yolo-lmk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">banned<\/a> last year — is still offering"https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/lmk-anonymous-polls\/id1465092216\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">its “anonymous polls” app<\/a> which integrates with Snapchat’s features. The app is rated 12+ on the App Store and is functioning as usual. But LMK was among those that requested and was granted an extension.<\/p>\nAnonymous messaging apps"https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/hmu-create-mess-fun\/id1591908473\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">HMU<\/a>, rated ages 9+ on the App Store, and"https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/intext-anonymous-q-a\/id1596909817\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Intext,<\/a> rated ages 4+, are also still operating. Both advertise themselves as Snapchat-connected apps. But Intext has been banned from Snap’s platform — you’ll get an error if you try to authenticate with Snapchat using the app’s “Login with Snapchat” button.<\/p>\nHMU appears to have skirted the ban, however, as its app was working until some time yesterday when it was banned.<\/p>\nMeanwhile, a number of friend-finding apps, like"https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/hoop-make-new-friends\/id1442571346\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hoop<\/a>,"https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/wink-make-new-friends\/id1482681335\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Wink<\/a>,"https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/swipr-make-new-friends\/id1537012560\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Swipr<\/a>,"https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/purp-make-new-friends\/id1562883907\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Purp<\/a> and"https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/dope-friends-for-snapchat\/id1582439585\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dope<\/a> — all of which are now supposed to be only available to adult users — are still published on the App Store with an age rating of 12+, as of the time of writing. If Snap had vetted and approved them, then they would have the highest age rating on the App Store, which is 17+. (Apple should change this to 18+!)<\/p>\nConfusingly, these apps’ lower age ratings don’t necessarily mean all the apps are breaking Snap’s policies. As it turns out, some of these apps are simplypositioning<\/em> themselves as being Snapchat-connected in their marketing materials — like their App Store screenshots. But in reality, they’re working around their lack of access to Snap’s SDK in other ways.<\/p>\nFor instance, Hoop’s App Store page says it’s for making friends on Snapchat, and yet it’s downloadable to anyone aged 12 or up. If it was a Snap Kit platform app, then it would be in violation. But Hoop is not in violation because it’s no longer using the SDK. (But who could tell?!)<\/p>\n"attachment_2319429\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">"caption-attachment-2319429\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2319429 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Screen-Shot-2022-05-16-at-4.16.38-PM.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"466\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Screen-Shot-2022-05-16-at-4.16.38-PM.jpg 759w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Screen-Shot-2022-05-16-at-4.16.38-PM.jpg?resize=150,103 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Screen-Shot-2022-05-16-at-4.16.38-PM.jpg?resize=300,206 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Screen-Shot-2022-05-16-at-4.16.38-PM.jpg?resize=680,466 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Screen-Shot-2022-05-16-at-4.16.38-PM.jpg?resize=50,34 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/>"caption-attachment-2319429\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image Credits:<\/strong> Hoop<\/p><\/div><\/p>\nInstead, Hoop has users enter their Snapchat username during onboarding and provides an in-app Snapchat button to “request” someone share their username with you. It’s a workaround that allows the app to still function as a tool for finding friends on Snapchat, but allows the app to operate without relying on developer access to the SDK. But this sort of deviousness on developers’ parts could cause complications for Snap in the future, as it faces potential litigation and regulations related to platform safety.<\/p>\nRequests for comment to the third-party app makers themselves were not returned.<\/p>\nFor parents, this lack of consistency across the Snapchat app ecosystem also means they can’t rely on using Apple or Google’s built-parental controls to block the Snapchat friend-finding apps from being downloaded to their child or younger teen’s device. And, once in the hands of younger users, bypassing the age-gate is as simple as using a fake birthdate.<\/p>\nSnap tells us that since it announced the new policies, it has removed the vast majority of apps that were out of compliance with its policies.<\/p>\n“First and foremost, we put the privacy and safety of our community first and expect the products built by our developer community to adhere to that standard in addition to bringing fun and positive experiences to people,” said Alston Cheek, director of Platform Partnerships at Snap. “We believe that we can take that stance on safety because our growing and vibrant developer community also expects us to do so; it is in their best interest for our platform to invent the future of AR, delight our community and help developers grow their businesses when we build the platforms of the future based on trust and safety.”<\/p>\nBut given the extent to which apps are skirting the rules, it could be more useful if the app stores themselves would integrate these same guidelines into their own app review processes. Or perhaps this is all a sign that regulation, in fact, is needed to protect children and teens from accessing experiences that are either potentially harmful or designed for adults.<\/p>\nAfter all, Snapchat shares the top charts with other apps that cater to a younger, often teenaged, user base — and the rules that apply to it, should apply to anyone.<\/p>\nFor instance, one app eating into the Gen Z market is the newer app called"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/04\/22\/bereal-hype-or-hit-what-to-know-about-the-gen-z-photo-sharing-app-climbing-the-charts\/\">BeReal,<\/a> which prompts users for spontaneous photos. BeReal has now surpassed 10 million cumulative downloads to date, according to estimates from app intelligence firm data.ai (formerly App Annie). Indeed, 3.3 million downloads took place in Q1 alone, and the majority of users in key markets are Gen Z, the firm said.<\/p>\n"embed breakout\">\n"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"gLxtS8EWbs\">"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/04\/22\/bereal-hype-or-hit-what-to-know-about-the-gen-z-photo-sharing-app-climbing-the-charts\/\">BeReal: Hype or hit?

Podcasts gains storage clean-up tools, support for annual subscriptions and a new distribution system"},"content":{"rendered":""speakable-summary\">As the battle for podcaster talent and distribution heats up among providers, Apple this morning announced the launch of several new features for its Apple Podcasts service, arriving alongside the latest software updates for iPhone, iPad and Mac. Key among these are features for managing podcast storage across devices, tools to enable annual podcast subscriptions and the newly announced Apple Podcasts Delegated Delivery system — a feature that will soon allow creators to more easily distribute their podcasts directly to Apple Podcasts from third-party hosting providers.<\/p>\nApple says this latter addition will save creators time and energy as they’ll be able to authorize their hosting provider to deliver both their free and premium podcast episodes to Apple Podcasts using the provider’s own dashboard. But it also gives Apple a means of competing with services like Spotify’s Anchor, which now provides tools for creation, hosting and distribution across all major listening apps.<\/p>\nStarting this fall, a select number of hosting providers will support the Delegated Delivery system, including Acast, ART19, Blubrry, Buzzsprout, Libsyn, Omny Studio and RSS.com. Apple says these providers represent around 80% of listening for premium content on Apple Podcasts, and more services will be added over time.<\/p>\nThe feature will be available at no additional cost to all creators through Apple Podcasts Connect and creators won’t need a membership to the Apple Podcasts Program to publish their free shows — only to publish premium content.<\/p>\nApple notes additional details about the new system, including educational resources for creators, will be introduced closer to the service’s launch. In the meantime, creators can visit the Hosting Providers page on Apple.com to stay tuned for further updates.<\/p>\nWhile the new distribution technology is top among today’s announcements, another new tool will be welcomed by longtime Apple Podcasts users — particularly those impacted by the app’s more recent bugs.<\/p>\nBecause Apple Podcasts is able to download shows to listeners’ devices, the app can end up consuming a lot of device storage. On iPhones in particular, this can lead to users running out of room for other essential activities — like taking photos or installing new apps and games.

The menu will allow listeners to choose to download a certain number of recent episodes, like the latest three, five or 10; or users can choose to download all episodes published recently, like in the last seven, 14 or 30 days. Or they can select “All New Episodes” or none by choosing the “Off” option. The latter makes Apple Podcasts function as a streaming-only app, which works for most people who live in areas with reliable cellular connectivity or access to Wi-Fi.<\/p>\nBy default, brand-new Apple Podcasts users will have the last five episodes kept for all episodic shows and all episodes kept for serial shows, the company says. Otherwise, the default will be to keep all new episodes if nothing else is configured.<\/p>\nWhat’s more is when a user selects their preference, the app will then prompt them to remove the automatically downloaded episodes on the device that now no longer meet the newly selected criteria. That means this feature actually works as a bulk clean-up tool for removing a large number of downloads from the device storage. Before, this was a tedious, manual process that could be tackled in different ways. Users could mark shows as played while having the “Remove Played Downloads” setting turned on, or they could"https:\/\/podcasters.apple.com\/support\/1662-automatic-downloads-on-apple-podcasts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">manually remove<\/a>\u00a0the downloads for a show or individual episodes one by one.<\/p>\nThese new preferences can also be customized at the show level, not just system-wide, for a more personalized experience.<\/p>\nThis new functionality will also be integrated into the iPhone’s recommendations related to cleaning up device storage. From iPhone Storage (under Settings –> General), users will be prompted to keep only the last five episodes and delete older shows if podcast episodes take up more than 15% of their device storage.<\/p>\nThe selected settings carry over to Mac, as well, which gives desktop users the ability to make decisions related to their Mac storage. That means this is the first time listeners can automatically delete old episodes across their devices.<\/p>\n"attachment_2319017\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">"caption-attachment-2319017\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2319017\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Manage-Storage-on-white.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"607\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Manage-Storage-on-white.png 3723w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Manage-Storage-on-white.png?resize=150,134 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Manage-Storage-on-white.png?resize=300,268 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Manage-Storage-on-white.png?resize=768,686 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Manage-Storage-on-white.png?resize=680,607 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Manage-Storage-on-white.png?resize=1536,1372 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Manage-Storage-on-white.png?resize=2048,1830 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Manage-Storage-on-white.png?resize=50,45 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/>"caption-attachment-2319017\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image Credits:<\/strong> Apple<\/p><\/div><\/p>\nFinally, Apple says it’s introducing the option for podcast creators to present annual subscription plans for their premium podcasts alongside their monthly options. These appear when a user taps “Subscribe” or “Try Free” on a show or channel with a subscription. Of note, the annual subscription will now be selected as the default. And, when the annual cost is lower than if the listener paid monthly, the annual plan’s savings will be displayed to the user.<\/p>\nCreators are able to set up their annual subscriptions at price points they choose as they do their monthly subscriptions in Apple Podcasts Connect.<\/p>\nThe subscriptions and new storage features are rolling out with"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">iOS 15.5, iPadOS 15.5 and macOS 12.4.

Those departures could limit Apple’s ability to market podcast subscriptions to users, where Apple takes 15%-30% of subscription revenue, similar to the App Store.<\/p>\nAhead of this update, Apple last month introduced three new Apple Podcasts Collections \u2014 Darkside, tbh and Popped \u2014 which focus on true crime, culture and entertainment, respectively, and are available in the U.S. and Canada.

recommendations, critics’ scores and more, the company today announced at its Google I\/O developer conference that, later this year, users will be able to cast TV shows and movies directly from their Android phone or tablet to their TV. The company additionally offered updated metrics related to its Android OS’ growing footprint and introduced new Android OS developer tools.<\/p>\nGoogle has been working to overhaul its connected TV experience and the companion app since 2020, when it first"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/30\/the-new-chromecast-adds-a-remote-and-the-new-google-tv-interface-for-49\/\">introduced<\/a> the"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/23\/google-moving-movies-tv-tab-play-store-google-tv\/\">new Google TV interface<\/a> for its Chromecast streaming devices. It also applied the Google TV name to the app that was previously known as the Google Play Movies & TV app. Earlier this year, Google also"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/23\/google-moving-movies-tv-tab-play-store-google-tv\/\">removed the “Movies & TV” section<\/a> from the Play Store, noting the Google TV app would be the centralized place to buy, rent and watch movies and TV shows on mobile devices.<\/p>\nThe company didn’t provide additional details about its plans to add support for casting to the app, saying those would come closer to launch. But in a photo Google provided, it showed at least one of the supported apps is NBCU’s Peacock.<\/p>\n"attachment_2316535\" style=\"width: 1177px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">"caption-attachment-2316535\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2316535 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Cast-from-Google-TV-app.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"1167\" height=\"773\" \/>"caption-attachment-2316535\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image Credits:<\/strong> Google<\/p><\/div><\/p>\nAs part of its announcements, the company also offered a few updates on the Android TV ecosystem, noting there are now 110 million monthly active devices on Android TV OS, including Google TV. That’s up from the"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/18\/android-tv-os-reaches-80m-monthly-active-devices-adds-new-features\/\">80 million monthly active devices<\/a> figure Google announced at last year’s Google I\/O event.<\/p>\nIt also said the Android TV OS now offers over 10,000 apps.<\/p>\nOf course, the Android TV OS is not a direct equivalent to something like Roku or Amazon Fire TV, as it’s not only used on the company’s first-party devices, like Chromecast. Instead, Google’s strategy is to license its platform to partners, including TV OEMs and pay-TV operators worldwide. Currently, there are over 300 partners using the platform, including seven out of the 10 largest TV OEMs, Google said.<\/p>"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\nBut Google’s 110 million active devices figure can’t be directly compared with the metrics shared by rivals Roku and Amazon.<\/p>\nAndroid TV OS figures are actually calculated by counting the number of devices that were actively used in a month \u2014 which means a user with multiple devices could have those devices counted separately, but a family with multiple people watching on one device would be counted once.<\/p>\nRoku and Amazon define monthly active users as “accounts” that have been active during the month. That means, even if that account streams on several different devices during the time period, it would only be counted once. If Roku or Amazon were to calculate active devices as Google is doing, their numbers would be higher.<\/p>\nIn December 2020, Amazon said Fire TV had topped"https:\/\/advertising.amazon.com\/blog\/amazon-advertisers-can-now-reach-up-to-50m-monthly-active-users-on-fire-tv\">50 million<\/a> monthly active users — a number still"https:\/\/advertising.amazon.com\/solutions\/products\/video-ads?ref_=a20m_us_hnav_p_va\">referenced<\/a> today on its Amazon Ads website.\u00a0This January, Amazon also noted it had sold"https:\/\/variety.com\/2022\/digital\/news\/amazon-fire-tv-150-million-sold-1235147080\/\">more than 150 million<\/a> Fire TV devices to bring its metrics more in line with Google’s device claims.

that"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/08\/06\/surprise-no-one-buys-things-via-alexa\/\">no one uses Alexa<\/a> for voice-based shopping. But retail giant still sees the potential for Alexa as a shopping companion — just in a different way. That’s why this month the company quietly rolled out a new feature designed to boost consumers’ use of Alexa’s Shopping Lists:"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/b?node=23869270011&tag=aftvn-20\">cashback offers<\/a>.<\/p>\nThe company confirmed to TechCrunch it introduced “"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/b?node=23869270011&tag=aftvn-20\">Alexa Shopping List Savings<\/a>,” which puts rebate offers from brands and manufacturers directly into consumers’ hands through the Alexa app, its mobile companion app for Echo device owners. The company says the offers will be displayed in the Alexa Shopping List section within the app and then can be used across retail stores nationwide to help customers save money.<\/p>\nTo use the feature, you’d first select the offers of interest and activate them in the app, then visit your favorite grocery store, drug store, or chain store to buy the product, the Amazon website explains in an FAQ. The details about the offers around how they can be applied are also available in the app, Amazon notes. When you’ve completed your purchase, shoppers claim their rebate by taking a photo of the store receipt that shows the store’s name, location, date and time of purchases, product price and total, then submit it to Amazon through the app. Customers also have to scan the barcode on the product itself to complete the process.<\/p>\nAmazon will send the rebate to the customer via their Amazon Gift Card account. This process may take up to a week but typically takes just 24-48 hours, Amazon says. The Gift Card balance can be used to shop across tens of millions of eligible products on Amazon.<\/p>\n"attachment_2317634\" style=\"width: 1510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">"caption-attachment-2317634\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2317634 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/amazon-alexa-offers.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1594\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/amazon-alexa-offers.png 1500w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/amazon-alexa-offers.png?resize=141,150 141w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/amazon-alexa-offers.png?resize=282,300 282w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/amazon-alexa-offers.png?resize=768,816 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/amazon-alexa-offers.png?resize=640,680 640w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/amazon-alexa-offers.png?resize=1445,1536 1445w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/amazon-alexa-offers.png?resize=47,50 47w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\" \/>"caption-attachment-2317634\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image Credits:<\/strong> Amazon<\/p><\/div><\/p>\nAs you may expect, this system provides Amazon with a treasure trove of customer shopping data beyond just the offers customers were interested in and were redeeming.<\/p>\nThe website notes that by choosing to participate in the Alexa Shopping List Savings program, customers are agreeing to share their personal information and data with Amazon:<\/p>"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n\u2026 we will get any information you provide, including receipt images and information we may extract from those receipts, and the offers you activate.

Further details were not provided.<\/p>\nBroadly, this business model is not unique to Amazon. Other apps offer similar tools to turn customers’ retail store receipts into “free” gift cards. (They’re not really free — you paid with your data!) For instance, apps like Fetch Rewards, Ibotta, Checkout51 and others make money through affiliate commissions, through the resale of customers’ anonymized data or both, then share some of that revenue back with the customer in the form of cash back or gift cards.<\/p>\nLike rival apps, Amazon’s offers tend to be the same sort of grocery rewards you’d see elsewhere. This includes consumer packaged goods, health and beauty items, baby items, canned food and more — not fresh groceries or other retail categories, like electronics or apparel.<\/p>\nOf course, some people don’t mind sharing their data with businesses in exchange for rewards or cash back — top apps like Fetch and Ibotta have millions of users, in fact. But consumers should be aware that Amazon’s privacy policy makes no promises of anonymizing any data nor does it explain in detail exactly how this data will be put to use.<\/p>\nThe feature is live in the Amazon Alexa mobile app today.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"It’s been said that no one uses Alexa for voice-based shopping.

For Snap, it sees the advantage in bringing the technology — and the team’s expertise — in-house to help the company reduce its operational costs across teams and to free up engineering bandwidth. This also allows Snap to focus more on building out other core Snapchat experiences, the company said.<\/p>\nA Snap spokesperson told TechCrunch that KeyDB’s technology will be of significant use across all of Snap, including its monetization and Spotlight platforms. The latter is Snapchat’s short-form video product and a rival to TikTok, which is now a key part of Snap’s business.<\/p>\nKeyDB’s multithreaded database utilizes Redis data structures, flash storage and replication, and runs at Snap scale, the company noted. It’s also an open source project that has a large community, with more than 3 million public downloads.<\/p>\nFortunately for other engineers, Snap says it will continue the open source project and will also open source KeyDB’s Pro and Enterprise offerings following the acquisition. This will allow the company to continue to benefit from the broader community contributions, we’re told, but will also help Snap to better establish its own presence within the open source community and establish relationships with more developers.<\/p>\nPlus, as Snap’s engineers merge their own internal improvements into the KeyDB project, the company believes it will be able to help solve challenges across the broader community.<\/p>"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\nGoing forward, visitors to the"https:\/\/github.com\/EQ-Alpha\/KeyDB\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">KeyDB GitHub repository<\/a> will be redirected to the"https:\/\/github.com\/Snapchat\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">"il\">Snap<\/span> GitHub repository<\/a>.<\/p>\nThe KeyDB team, meanwhile, will continue to work from Toronto, where Snap already has a sizable office that includes, among others, its Bitmoji team.<\/p>\nSnap has been fairly acquisitive over the past year or so, with many of its recent mergers and acquisitions being focused on underlying technologies.

Play targets emerging markets with prepaid app subscriptions and more"},"content":{"rendered":""speakable-summary\">At the Google I\/O developer conference today, the company introduced several changes designed to make it easier for Android app developers to generate revenue via subscriptions, particularly when trying to reach users in emerging markets. Most notably, the company said it will"https:\/\/android-developers.googleblog.com\/2022\/05\/new-ways-to-sell-subscriptions-on-google-play.html\">now allow developers<\/a> to offer users the ability to subscribe via prepaid plans that essentially provide access to an app and its services for fixed amount of time the developer sets.<\/p>\nThe users would then be able to buy top-ups in the app when their subscription ran out and they had the funds to continue. Google said the feature would make sense in regions where pay-as-you-go cellular plans are standard. In those markets, consumers are already used to the prepaid model, so extending it to apps could help to boost developers’ subscription revenues. However, prepaid subscriptions could also help to target other use cases as well — like subscription-adverse customers who are hesitant to get locked into ongoing charges and who want more control over when and how much they’re spending on their mobile apps.<\/p>\nGoogle also"https:\/\/android-developers.googleblog.com\/2022\/05\/new-ways-to-sell-subscriptions-on-google-play.html\">announced<\/a> expanded pricing options with the launch of “ultra-low” price points to reach users in emerging markets.<\/p>\nLast March, Google had reduced the minimum price limit for products in more than 20 markets across Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia-Pacific, allowing developers to drop prices down to as low as 10 to 30 cents (USD). At the time, the company explained these “sub-dollar prices” would allow developers to reach new potential buyers by adjusting pricing to “better reflect local purchasing power and demand.”<\/p>\nNow, Google says developers can drop prices to as low as 5 U.S. cents. This would allow developers to also run local sales and promotions and support various micro-transactions, like in-app tipping.<\/p>\nWhile these changes will help to better target Android app users in emerging markets, Google made other improvements to app subscriptions, as well.<\/p>\nThe company said it’s making it easier to sell subscriptions on Google Play by allowing developers to configure multiple base plans and special offers, in order to reduce the overhead of having to manage an increasing number of SKUs as developers tweak how they want to sell subscriptions with offers.<\/p>"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2315603 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/google-play-subscriptions-base-plans.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1110\" height=\"706\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/google-play-subscriptions-base-plans.jpg 1110w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/google-play-subscriptions-base-plans.jpg?resize=150,95 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/google-play-subscriptions-base-plans.jpg?resize=300,191 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/google-play-subscriptions-base-plans.jpg?resize=768,488 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/google-play-subscriptions-base-plans.jpg?resize=680,433 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/google-play-subscriptions-base-plans.jpg?resize=50,32 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1110px) 100vw, 1110px\" \/><\/p>\nIn this setup, a developer can establish multiple base plans each with its own billing period and renewal type — like monthly or annual auto-renewing plans or monthly prepaid plans. Then, for each base plan, they can create multiple special offers across the subscription lifecycle. For example, they could create an acquisition offer for a limited time free trial, an upgrade offer to move from a prepaid plan to an auto-renewing tier, or even a downgrade offer to help retain a subscriber who may be looking to cancel as they’re not using their full subscription benefits.<\/p>\nGoogle also offers an"https:\/\/developer.android.com\/google\/play\/billing\/subscriptions#in-app-messaging\">In-App Messaging API<\/a> that can be used to remind users to update their payment information when their payment method is declined, it noted.<\/p>\nThe company last year announced it would begin to support other payment methods, including both cash and prepaid plans. In the time since, it’s expanded its payment method library to include over 300 local payment methods in 70 countries, and added eWallet payment methods such as MerPay in Japan, KCP in Korea, and Mercado Pago in Mexico, Google said.<\/p>\n"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/tag\/google-io-2022\/\">"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/google-io-2022-banner.jpg\" alt=\""Read\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"At the Google I\/O developer conference today, the company introduced several changes designed to make it easier for Android app developers to generate revenue via subscriptions, particularly when trying to reach users in emerging markets.

Play adopts App Store-like features including in-app events and custom product pages"},"content":{"rendered":""speakable-summary\">At Google’s I\/O developer conference, the company rolled out a series of updates for Android app developers who publish to Google Play. Among these were two high-profile changes to its Google Play app marketplace, custom store listings and in-app events, which follow"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/07\/apple-to-introduce-a-b-testing-and-in-app-events-to-the-app-store\/\">updates Apple made to its own App Store<\/a> just last year.<\/p>\nGoogle had been offering A\/B testing for"https:\/\/android-developers.googleblog.com\/2015\/05\/empowering-successful-global-businesses.html\"> product page enhancements<\/a> since 2015 — a feature that allows developers to see which text and graphics would best convert users.<\/p>\nApple later adopted a similar feature when, at last year’s Worldwide Developer Conference,"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/07\/apple-to-introduce-a-b-testing-and-in-app-events-to-the-app-store\/\">it introduced Product Page Optimization<\/a> designed to help developers to try out different app screenshots, videos and even app icons to try to appeal to different types of users. Developers could segment a certain percentage of App Store traffic to these cohorts to see which product pages performed better before deciding which page should be their default.<\/p>\nApple last year also announced a related feature called"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/app-store\/custom-product-pages\/\">Custom Product Pages<\/a> that lets developers create different product pages to highlight different app features, each with its own unique URL to be used in external marketing channels.<\/p>\nToday, Google is following suit and essentially launching the same thing with Custom Store Listings.<\/p>\nInstead of simply testing different product pages, Android app developers will be able to make up to 50 custom store listings for their apps. Each page will have its own analytics and deep links available. Notably, this is more listings than Apple’s solution offers, which is currently"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/app-store\/custom-product-pages\/\">set at 35 per app.<\/a> Google explains developers can use this feature to display different listings to users based on where they’re coming from. For example, a developer with a recipe-finding app could target ad campaigns to U.S. users based on U.S. holidays, by showcasing recipes for Thanksgiving or Fourth of July. But it could target users from other markets at different times with recipes related to their own cultural traditions.<\/p>\nApple last year also introduced an App Store feature,"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/app-store\/in-app-events\/\">in-app events<\/a>, to allow developers to promote real-time happenings going on inside their apps — like special events or even just seasonal deals.<\/p>"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\nGoogle Play is now rolling out its own take on this feature, as well.<\/p>\nWith the launch of what it’s calling “"http:\/\/android-developers.googleblog.com\/2022\/05\/play.google.com\/console\/about\/programs\/liveopsbeta\">LiveOps<\/a>,” developers will be able to submit content for featuring on the Play Store, including major updates for their app or game, in-app events and limited-time offers.<\/p>\nGoogle says LiveOps can drive 5% more 28-day active users to apps and deliver 4% higher revenue for those using the feature compared with those who don’t. The feature is in an invite-only beta testing phase for the time being.<\/p>\nWhile these changes were the highlights among those designed to help developers target, acquire and reengage their users, Google also"http:\/\/android-developers.googleblog.com\/2022\/05\/whats-new-in-google-play.html\">announced<\/a> a few other notable Google Play updates.<\/p>\nThe company said the Play Store would be updated to help people find the best tablet-optimized apps with new large-screen focused editorial content and a separate review and rating system for large-screen applications. Google Play will also later this year be updated to look better on tablets and foldable devices.<\/p>\n"attachment_2316998\" style=\"width: 1526px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">"caption-attachment-2316998\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2316998 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Screen-Shot-2022-05-11-at-3.37.07-PM-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1516\" height=\"988\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Screen-Shot-2022-05-11-at-3.37.07-PM-1.jpg 1516w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Screen-Shot-2022-05-11-at-3.37.07-PM-1.jpg?resize=150,98 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Screen-Shot-2022-05-11-at-3.37.07-PM-1.jpg?resize=300,196 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Screen-Shot-2022-05-11-at-3.37.07-PM-1.jpg?resize=768,501 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Screen-Shot-2022-05-11-at-3.37.07-PM-1.jpg?resize=680,443 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Screen-Shot-2022-05-11-at-3.37.07-PM-1.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1516px) 100vw, 1516px\" \/>"caption-attachment-2316998\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image Credits:<\/strong> Google<\/p><\/div><\/p>\nFor developers, Google also"https:\/\/goo.gle\/play-sdk\">launched the Google Play SDK Index,<\/a> which lists over 100 popular SDKs and which app permissions they use, so developers can determine if they adhere to Google Play policies and help fill out"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/04\/26\/google-play-launches-its-own-privacy-nutrition-labels-following-similar-effort-by-apple\/\">their app’s privacy labels<\/a>.<\/p>\nThe company said it will soon launch a new Play Console page dedicated to deep links to put all the information and tools for deep links in one place. It also improved its Store Listing Experiments feature (aka A\/B testing) to allow developers to see their results more quickly, with more transparency and control so they can better understand how long each experiment may need to run.<\/p>\nAnd beyond this, it rolled out features focus on improving app quality, including a new Developer Reporting API for accessing Android vitals metrics and issues data outside the Play Console; support for viewing vitals data at the country level; and Google said it’s making it possible to view vitals alongside Firebase Crashlytics. It\u00a0updated the Play Console by adding revenue and revenue growth metrics to"https:\/\/play.google.com\/console\/about\/reachanddevices\/\">Reach and devices<\/a> and overhauling its"https:\/\/play.google.com\/console\/about\/devicecatalog\/\">device catalog<\/a> to include install data and filters by new device attributes like shared libraries.
