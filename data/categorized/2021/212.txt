The nascent brain prostheses sector received commercial validation with the acquisition of University of California, Berkeley spinout Iota Biosciences by Tokyo-based Astellas late last year. The sale of the startup, which is developing ‘neural dust’—minute devices combining electrodes with a piezoelectric crystal that can be implanted in the brain or onto peripheral nerves—signals that bioelectronic medicines are receiving increasing recognition from traditional biopharma companies. And the knock-on effects of the deal could augur a wider embrace of brain–computer interface (BCI) research and devices by biopharma companies focused on diseases of the nervous system.
Astellas is spending as much as $429 million to get a jump on Iota’s technology, which can directly monitor and stimulate groups of neurons for purposes of both disease surveillance and therapeutic intervention. It’s “pushing the boundaries of what people thought was possible with microelectronics,” says Juan-Pablo Mas, a partner at Action Potential Venture Capital in Palo Alto, California, a wholly owned subsidiary of GlaxoSmithKline.
Iota had its beginnings a decade ago when Berkeley researchers Jose Carmena and Michel Maharbiz came up with the idea for battery-free electronics that might be small enough to implant directly in the central nervous system. The two helped found Iota in 2017. Iota’s wireless ‘NeuralDust’ and ‘StimDust’ medical devices can be implanted practically anywhere in the body and are powered using an ultrasound energy source rather than an onboard battery.
The piezoelectric crystals in Iota’s neural chips accumulate ultrasound energy and turn it into electricity, according to Krishna Shenoy, an electrical engineer at Stanford University and a consultant for BCI companies Neuralink and Ctrl-Labs. A patch the size of a large Band-Aid could hold both a tiny ultrasound emitter to power the devices (neural dust ‘motes’) and transmitters to receive information from the chips inside the patient, Shenoy says. Each neural dust mote consists of a piezoelectric transducer, surface electrodes for electrophysiological signal acquisition, and a silicon CMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor) chip containing electronics for signal amplification and conversion. Recorded signals are reported back to the transmitter/interrogator by reflecting and modulating the amplitude, frequency and/or phase of the impinging ultrasound wave.
NeuralDustwas first described for monitoring nerve or muscle signals;StimDustis now also available for stimulating nerves. Although the technology was originally intended to be free-floating in the brain, the chips proved to be too large. But the company’s researchers were able to turn that weakness into a strength: “Iota realized that they had a device that was very good for the peripheral nervous system,” says Vikash Gilja, an electrical and computer engineer at University of California, San Diego.
The chips—prototypes are 1.7 mm³, or about the size of the date on a US penny—are small enough that they can be inserted by injection, which is simpler and less costly than surgery. The ability to easily implant them anywhere in the body makes the devices potentially useful for several types of treatments, says Mas. “Drug companies are always looking for new mechanisms of action and targets.” Last February, Iota demonstrated their wireless power scheme using StimDust particles implanted on rats’ sciatic nerves.
The Iota sale is a reflection of a pair of trends: the miniaturization of technology and disappointments in drug treatment for brain disorders, says Nick Ramsey, a neuropsychopharmacologist at the University of Utrecht. “These bring some hope that with more engineering-based interventions there’s better results for people who have to deal with the consequences of a brain disorder, whether it’s stroke or ALS or eventually psychiatric disorders.”By tapping into the nervous system, neural devices could help uncover the causes of chronic disease, Mas says. The devices could also provide a detailed readout of how well a patient is responding to treatment, says Matt Angle, CEO of BCI maker Paradromics.
A system that records anywhere in the body “potentially opens up the number of applications for this technology.”More generally, the acquisition of Iota spells good news for the BCI field. A system that records anywhere in the body “potentially opens up the number of applications for this technology, which would therefore increase the market size, making it feasible to bring this product to market,” says Jennifer Collinger, a bioengineer at the University of Pittsburgh.
If Astellas and Iota are successful with NeuralDust-like implants, even in the peripheral nervous system, it would move the BMI field forward, says Shenoy. The hope is that in the next few years one of these technologies gains US Food and Drug Administration approval.
BCIs include cortical implants, such as the ones used in research, which are positioned close enough to brain tissue to capture signals from groups of individual neurons. Another type of interface—less invasive, but also less precise—is the electrocorticography (ECoG) grid system that reads the average signal from a larger number (hundreds to thousands) of neurons. Clinicians temporarily place these on the surface of the brain under the dura to identify where seizures might originate, and researchers collect brain data by testing those patients. The invasive BCI field remains far fromcommercial prime timecompared with external neurostimulatory devices, such as cochlear implants and Bioness’s spinal cord stimulator, or wearables such as the wristwatch-based surface electromyography device from Facebook and CTR-Labs. But interest is growing in devices that can read brain or muscle neural signals when placed outside the body.
The only FDA-approved cortical implant is the Utah grid, formally known as the NeuroPort Array, from Blackrock Microsystems. The 4-millimeter-square chip with 100 tiny electrode protrusions is implanted into the surface of the brain and records from neurons 1.5 millimeters deep. It is sold for research use only, but can be used in clinical trials under an Investigational Device Exemption.
Researchers have used Utah Grid implants to enable people to control prosthetic robotic arms in three dimensions, pick up objects, and even feel those objects through sensors that measure force and then stimulate the brain, says Shenoy. By adding tiny electrodes implanted in the muscles, these implants can control paralyzed limbs, he says.
Two companies, Neuralink and Paradromics, are working on cortical implants for the commercial market. Neuralink, funded by entrepreneur Elon Musk’s deep pockets, is aiming to put multiple electrodes along single wires to record at different depths so that more information can be collected from each probe. DARPA-funded Paradromics is working on a cortical implant that has 1,600 platinum–iridium microwires and onboard signal processing to compress the data it sends, says Angle. The company is aiming for a human feasibility study in the next three years, he adds.
Another company, Synchron (formerly the startup SmartStent) is taking a different approach: threading astentthat contains electrodes through the body’s circulatory system into the fine vessels that feed the target neurons. The question with this technology is how practical it is to safely use the circulatory system to position the arrays, says Shenoy.
As the field of neural interface devices continues making progress in demonstrating clinical outcomes and technology continues to develop, Gilja thinks corporate interest will continue to grow. For now, Iota’s path from academia to acquisition is a measure of success. “I am confident that other companies will follow,” he says.
