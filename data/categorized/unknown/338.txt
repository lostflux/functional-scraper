Homeworld of the human species, Earth has been at the forefront of galactic history, from encounters with thePrecursors[8]to the end of theCovenant Empire.
[9]Inhabited long ago by aprehistoric interstellar human governmentconquered and dissolved by the Forerunners,[8]Earth is currently the capital world of theUnified Earth Government.
Earth was possibly the most populated planet of the human space territories. For a significant amount of humanity's history, it was their only known place in the universe to support life.
ContentsHistoryPangaea, the super-continent 250 million years ago that was the amalgamation of all current present-daycontinents.
PrehistoryThe Earth first formed about 4.6 billion years ago, and gave rise to the first single-celled organisms about 3.9 billion years ago. About 200,000 years ago, the ancestors of modern humans,Homo Sapiens, evolved in Africa. Indigenous to Eastern Africa, they gradually spread across the entire planet. Eventually, the humans, originally consisting of groups of hunter-gatherers, began to develop intocivilizations.
Human civilizations gradually became more and more complex, and eventually, possibly through contact with the Forerunners, humanity discovered spaceflight and spread across theOrion Armof theMilky Way galaxy. After being defeated ina waragainst the Forerunner civilization, the humans were exiled back to Earth, with their species devolved and splintered into multiple subspecies and their culture degrading back to a primitive state for millennia.
After the war with the Forerunners, Earth and humanity came under the charge of theThe Librarian, a ForerunnerLifeshaperwho helped the humans slowly work towards rebuilding a primitive civilization. Remnants of their former technology, such as steam power and hot-air balloon flight, were re-learned under her care but later forgotten after the firing of the Halo Array.
[8]Forerunner-Flood warNear the end of their war with theFlood,[10]the Forerunners built amachineto generate aslipspace portaltothe Arkin Africa.
[11]They also indexed the human species as a part of theirConservation Measureto preserve life in the galaxy after the activation of theHalo Array. After the array's activation, human life was planted back on Earth, where it successfully re-developed.
[12]Civilization and the Modern AgeAfter the recovery from the Array, humans reduced back to hunter-gatherers for nearly a hundred thousand years, until civilizations began to form anew.
By the year 1914, much of the world was divided into two factions, the Triple Entente, orAllies: theUnited Kingdom,France,Russia, and later theUnited States of America, and the Triple Alliance, or Central Powers:Germany,Austria-Hungary, and other nations of similar ideals. The Central Powers were defeated at the end ofWorld War Iin 1918, resulting in a decade of prosperity for the Allies, followed by an economic depression and the rise of Fascism, Nazism, and Communism in many countries. In 1939, another World War erupted, between theAllies(Britain,the Soviet Union, which were, again, later joined by theUnited States, and many other nations) and theAxis(Nazi Germany,Fascist Italy, and theEmpire of Japan). In 1945, the Allies defeated the Axis. Later that year, the victorious nations, in an attempt to prevent more World Wars, founded theUnited Nations, an international assembly of peaceful nations, whose goal was to settle international disputes peacefully, and was the predecessor to the UNSC. In 1957, humanity finally made their way into space with unmanned probes and by 1961, humans themselves had gone into space. In 1969, humanity had finally stepped on an extraterrestrial surface-Earth's Moon.
After World War II, humanity would lack war on that scale, although smaller wars and conflicts erupted, including theKorean War,Vietnam War,Cold War, and the first and second Iraq War. In the early 21st century, terrorism became a particular thorn in the side for the nations on Earth and small wars broke out along with civil unrest in many countries. However, no full wars on the same scale as past World Wars erupted until two centuries later.
Interplanetary colonization and conflictsBy2080, humanity'snational governments, under the auspices of theUnited Nations, had begun to establish colonies on the other planets in the Sol system. However, expansion did not come without problems. In the mid-22nd century, two major dissident factions emerged; the neo-communistKoslovicsand fascistFrieden, which began to battle one another and the United Nations.
[13]In March–June2160, Jovian Frieden secessionists attacked members of theUnited Nationson the moonIo, which led to three months of fighting between the Earth military and Jovian Frieden forces. National governments began to support their own colonies which sparked proxy wars off-planet, leading to tension and militarization on Earth. In2162, armed conflict ripped throughSouth America, starting theRainforest Wars, as Koslovic, Frieden, and UN forces all clashed over ideological differences, sparking additional conflicts off-planet. In December of2163, the three factionsclashed, this time onMars. This was the first extraterrestrial use of Marines, who launched lightning raids on Koslovic positions, permanently affecting military doctrine for centuries. In2164, UN forces began a massive military build-up and began the first true interplanetary war. The forces of the fledgling United Nations Space Command were significantly bolstered by a massive propaganda campaign running on the victories on Mars and over the next six years took back the Sol system and drove the dissident factions to destruction. Now with a massive military with no enemy to fight, overpopulation, famine, and a collapsing economy, the newly unified Earth faced an uncertain future.
[13]It was not until2291that this problem was solved when researchers created theShaw-Fujikawa Translight Enginewhich enabled superluminal travel by allowing access to an alternate domain known asSlipstream Space. In2310, the UNSC unveiled their first line of colony ships and the best and brightest from both civilian walks of life and the military set out to form theInner colonies. This eased the overpopulation problem upon Earth which became the capital of theUnified Earth Government, while the inner colony ofReachwould later become the headquarters of the UNSC.
[13]The Insurrection and the Human-Covenant warHumanity would enter a period of peaceful stability for the next two hundred years, untilcivil unrest beganto spread in the Outer Colonies, with various groups seeking secession from Earth and theUEG. The scale of the unrest would steadily rise, eventually becoming a major threat by2517.
All this was suddenly and violently rendered a moot point when a single alien ship made an unprovoked attack on the colony of Harvest, humanity's first encounter with an alien civilization - the Covenant. Over the next twenty-seven years, humanity would wage a brutal war for survival, losing hundreds of colonies, including all of the Outer Colonies in 2536; and on 31 August 2552, the UNSC's largest military installation, the planet Reach, was destroyed by the Covenant. During the entire course of the conflict, the UNSC followed theCole Protocol, which declared that no UNSC vessel targeted by the Covenant was to retreat to Earth, as a means of ensuring the secrecy and security of the planet's location. In nearly twenty-seven years of galactic warfare, the Covenant never succeeded in determining the location of Earth through the measures taken under the Cole Protocol. However, by September 2552, Earth was humanity's last major stronghold in its war against the Covenant.
Despite the effectiveness of this law, on 20 October 2552, the Covenant launched their first attack upon Earth, rendering the Cole Protocol moot and initiating the final confrontation between UNSC forces and the Covenant.
[14][15]Pre-Battle of EarthPrior to the Covenant invasion of Earth, there had been a suppressed influx of information by ONI, resulting in people going about their normal lives even up until the attack. Several fleets were brought to Earth. Some like theFifth Fleetwere merged with the Home Fleet in a special command grouping.
[16]Other fleets brought to Earth include theSecond Fleet,Seventh Fleet, and theSixteenth Fleet.
[17]The6th Battle Group[18]along with large amounts of Marines, Army Troopers, andODSTspresent, fiveSPARTAN-IIswere also brought to or were near Earth.
Battle of EarthTheUNSCDFforces in a counter-offensive engagement in response to the Covenant occupation of Mombasa.
On October 20, 2552, the first Covenant forces entered theSol system. ACovenant expeditionary forceconsisting of 13CCS-class battlecruisersand 2CAS-class assault carriersarrived in system, first detected around Io, the third largest moon of Jupiter.
[15]After the existence of the Covenant presence was confirmed by probes, the UNSCDF forces went to full alert. The option was taken to wait for the Covenant forces to come to them rather than letFleet Admiral Harperlaunch a counterattack.
The space battle above Earth.
The Covenant began to work on punching a hole through the orbital defenses by taking out the stations in the battle cluster above the Mediterranean Sea via bombs planted by boarding parties.
[15]After the Covenant fleet attempted to rush through the newly formed gap the UNSC fleet annihilated them, destroying most of the Covenant battlecruisers but failing to destroy the assault carriers. One of the assault carriers was successfully destroyed bySPARTAN-IIJohn-117but the other, commanded by theHigh Prophet of Regretassaulted the city ofMombasainKenya.
[19]Groundside, the Covenant assault carrier had already deployed its ground forces and occupied the city. The Covenant ground forces immediately constructed defense emplacements and structures to reinforce their newly acquired sites against the counter-offensive UNSC forces. TheUNSCIn Amber Cladwas the first UNSC ship to respond to the Covenant occupation. The ship sent in their complements consisting ofSPARTAN-IIJohn-117,Sergeant Avery Johnsonand elements of the7th Orbital Drop Shock Trooper Battalion.
[19]The Covenant were subsequently dislodged fromOld Mombasaand, following the destruction of aScarab, from New Mombasa as well.
[19][20]The High Prophet of Regret eventually ordered a general retreat and had his assault carrier initiate a slipspace jump while still over the city. TheIn Amber Cladfollowed in the carrier's wake, while the city was left in chaos.
[20]A larger Covenant fleet arriving shortly after Regret's departure and excavating around Mombasa.
Prior to the slipspace event, a contingent of ODSTs were dropped from theUNSCSay My Nameto assist theIn Amber Clad's counter-offensive efforts.
[21]The slipspace rupture prevented the assist from taking place, plunging the ODSTs into uncontrolled freefall and scattered across the city. However,one particular squad of ODSTssurvived and continued their operation in securing the city'sinfrastructure AI. During the operation, the squad witnessed the arrival ofa larger Covenant fleetafter escaping the city.
[22]The Covenant returned in force following the Prophet of Regret's abortive attack and a Covenant assault forces succeeded in penetrating the orbital defenses. AtMount Erebus, the sea floor off of theYucatan Peninsula, and at theCentennial Orbital ElevatorinHavana,Cuba, the Covenant were stymied by threeSPARTAN-II's, only to have those SPARTAN-IIs get re-deployed toOnyx.
[23]The Covenant deployed their forces all across Earth, striking at major cities such asCleveland,Ohio; but thisattacktoo was repulsed through the efforts of ODST forces and the self-sacrifice of ColonelJames Ackerson. However, UNSC forces were unable to repulse and route Covenant landings in Kenya. After breaking Earth'sspace defenses, the Covenant bombarded Earth in Eastern Africa. The Covenant eventually succeeded in eradicating Mombasa and uncovering their primary target:The Artifact.
The arrival in-system of John-117 in a Covenant-controlledForerunner dreadnought, freshly escaped from theBattle of Installation 05, was unexpected.
[24]John-117 disembarked from the dreadnought in Earth's atmosphere, later recovered by Marines and taken toCrow's Nest.
[25]With the aid ofThel 'Vadam,Commander Miranda Keyes, and Sergeant Avery Johnson, John-117breached the Covenant anti-air defensesnear the excavated artifact, clearing the way for an aerial strike on the Dreadnought powering it.
[26][27]The strike was unable to disable the device or prevent theProphet of Truthfrom traveling through the portal. After a brief intervention by the Flood, a joint Separatist/UNSC force departed through the portal in pursuit.
[28]This series of events saw the complete departure of the Covenant from Earth as they ventured forth to Installation 00, where they would finally be crushed by the UNSC and their Separatist allies.
Post-War PeriodFollowing the victory at the Battle of Earth and theBattle of Installation 00, the Human-Covenant war ended in March 2553. Many of Earth's cities were left in ruins and the planet's population was sharply reduced as a result of the Covenant invasion. With the war's end and the departure of the Covenant separatists to their respective homeworlds, the UNSC began to rebuild the extensive damage inflicted upon Earth's infrastructure and human population. Following the end of the Human-Covenant war, Earth saw an influx of refugees from former Covenant species, who were walled off in "conclaves."TheComposerfiring onNew Phoenix.
On July 25, 2557,[29]Shadow-of-Sundered-Starmoved into targeting range in theMantle's Approachwith theComposerand proceeds to compose the residents ofNew Phoenix.
John-117and with the help ofBattlegroup Dakota, flew aBroadswordinto the ship. There he confronted the Didact and used aPulse grenadeto send him through aslipspaceportal toInstallation 03. John then detonates aHAVOK Tactical Nuclear Weapon, destroying the Composer and the ship. This was then dubbed theNew Phoenix Incidentand the city was placed under quarantine until eight months later on 24 March 2558.
[29]In 2557, only six months after the New Phoenix Incident, an unknown Sangheili refugee attempted to detonate a HAVOK Tactical Nuclear bomb in Rio de Janeiro, but was apprehended byFireteam Majesticbefore he could do so.
[30]At the beginning ofThe Reclamation, theCreatedknocked out power on Earth[31]and occupied it.
[32]GovernmentTheUNSC Supreme Headquartersis located on Earth and somewhere within theUnited Republic of North America[33]and is most likely where Earth is governed. This is mostly likely because theUnited Nationsexisted inNew York Cityfor a long time. It is very possible that the UNSC Supreme Headquarters was falsely identified and it is actually supposed to be theUEG's headquarters or doesn't exist. Not much else is known about Earth's specific government.
EconomyTradeTrade was one of the most important parts of the economy of Earth as most planets gathered resources to be sent back to Earth. This can be seen with Harvest, as they exported to Earth; mineral water, livestock and vegetables and fruit goods.
[34]As well, colonies likeReachexported out (presumably) metals like Titanium, to Earth.
[35]There are six orbital elevators on Earth that can allow for products to move off and on the planet.
[36]ShipbuildingEarth was also home to shipbuilding and repair yards.
[37]Corporations On PlanetA variety of corporations on operated on Earth and in different places. Seattle alone was known as a very corporate city.
[38]ListDefensesEarth was one of the, if not the most heavily defended planets in the human space as it was the capital of theUEG.
Sydneycontained theHIGHCOM Facility Bravo-6, the UNSC's headquarters, which was nicknamed 'The Hive'.
[39]Military AssetsThere were over three hundred operationalOrbital Defense Platforms.
[40]As well, there was theUNSC Home Fleetthat would help defend Earth and any otherSol systemcolony. Large amounts of Marines,ODSTs, andArmy Trooperswere as well on Earth or in system.
In the Post-War Era, the Home Fleet had a new formation calledBattlegroup Dakotathat consisted of theUNSCInfinityplus several newerUNSC Starships.
