Bringing the benefits of AI to everyoneAt Google AI, we’re conducting research that advances the state-of-the-art in the field, applying AI to products and to new domains, and developing tools to ensure that everyone can access AI.
AI is making it easier for people to do things every day, whether it’s searching for photos of loved ones, breaking down language barriers in Google Translate, typing emails on the go, or getting things done with the Google Assistant. AI also provides new ways of looking at existing problems, from rethinking healthcare to advancing scientific discovery.
We want to use AI to augment the abilities of people, to enable us to accomplish more and to allow us to spend more time on our creative endeavors.
Core to this approach is publishing our research in a wide variety of venues, and open sourcing our tools and systems, like TensorFlow. And while we fundamentally believe in the promise of AI, we also think that it’s critical that this technology is used to help people — that it is socially beneficial, fair, accountable, and works for everyone.
