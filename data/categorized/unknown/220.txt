macOSmacOS MontereyConnect, share, and create like never before. Say hello to exciting new FaceTime updates. Explore a redesigned Safari. Discover and invent powerful new ways to work using Universal Control and Shortcuts. Stay in the moment with Focus. And so much more.
Upgrade nowNew experiences.
True connections.
Staying in touch is more essential than ever. With SharePlay, you can watch together, listen together, and share your screen right inside FaceTime.
1FaceTime calls also sound and feel more natural. And Messages makes it even easier to find and enjoy the great content shared from friends and family.
FaceTimeIntroducing SharePlayKeep FaceTime conversations going as you watch TV shows and movies, listen to music, or share your screen with SharePlay. It’s an entirely new way to have experiences with family and friends no matter the distance.
Watch togetherStream movies and TV shows while on a FaceTime call with friends. With synced playback and controls, you’ll see everyone laugh, jump, and react to the same moments at the same time. And the volume automatically adjusts, so you can keep talking while you watch.
Watch togetherWatch your favorite videos, movies, and TV shows in sync with friends. The following apps and streaming services will support SharePlay later this year.
Listen togetherGet together and listen to an album with friends. The whole group can see what’s next and add songs to a shared queue with synced playback and easy‑to‑use controls.
Share your screenKeep your FaceTime calls going while simultaneously sharing your whole screen or just a specific app. Collaborate with coworkers, have a game night with friends, or plan your next vacation as a group.
Spatial audioIndividual voices sound like they’re coming from the direction in which each person is positioned on your screen, helping conversations flow more naturally.
2Mic modesVoice Isolation minimizes background noise and puts your voice front and center. When the music or sounds around you are as important as what you have to say, Wide Spectrum leaves the ambient sound unfiltered.
3Loud and clear.
Mic modesWith Voice Isolation, your mic uses machine learning to distinguish each sound it picks up, blocking ambient and distracting noises (like dogs barking or a TV in the next room) to make sure your voice comes through loud and clear.
Wide Spectrum lets your friends on FaceTime hear any and every sound happening where you are. It’s ideal for taking music lessons or for when you want someone to listen to what’s going on around you.
Grid viewGrid view shows people on your FaceTime call in the same‑size tiles, so you can have better conversations with a large group. The speaker is automatically highlighted so you always know who’s talking.
Portrait modeInspired by Portrait mode on iPhone and powered by the M1 chip, this new video effect puts the focus on you — not what’s behind you.
4FaceTime linksSchedule and share FaceTime calls with a unique web link.
FaceTime linksMake a unique FaceTime web link to easily set up a call for later or share the link with a group. Share it with your friends in Messages, Mail, or third‑party apps like WhatsApp. You can also generate a link for an event in Calendar, so everyone will know exactly where and when to meet.
Invite anyone to FaceTimeNow you can send friends and family a link to connect on FaceTime — even if they’re using Windows or Android.
1And it’s still end‑to‑end encrypted, so your call is as private and secure as any other FaceTime call.
MessagesShared with YouNow the links, images, and other content shared with you in Messages are featured in a new Shared with You section in the corresponding app. In Photos, Safari, Apple News, Apple Podcasts, and the Apple TV app, you can easily find shared content, see who recommended it, and reply right from the app you’re enjoying it from — without going back to Messages.
Photo collectionsMultiple photos in Messages now appear as a collage or an elegant stack of images that you can flip through. Easily view them all as a grid, reply with a quick Tapback, or save them to your library.
Designed to help your work flow.
The world’s fastest browser has a completely reimagined design, making Safari more immersive and customizable than ever. And with Quick Note and Focus, you’ve got new tools for keeping track of what’s important — and for clearing some headspace when you need it most.
SafariCompact tab barThe compact tab bar option takes up less space on the page and takes on the color of the site you’re on, extending the web page to the edge of the window. Tabs have been combined with the Smart Search field, giving you access to powerful Safari features with the click of a tab.
Tab GroupsSave and organize your tabs in the way that works best for you. Name your Tab Groups, edit them, and switch between them as you go from one interest to the next. You can even drag your groups into an email and the links effortlessly appear as an easy‑to‑share list.
Access Tab Groups anywhereTab Groups seamlessly sync across your Apple devices, so you can easily pick back up whenever and wherever you want.
FocusChoose a FocusFocus helps you stay in the moment when you need to concentrate or step away. Choose a Focus that only allows the notifications you want — you can get work done while you’re in the zone, or enjoy a distraction-free dinner. Pick from a list of suggested Focus options or create your own.
Signal your statusStepping away is easier if others know you’re busy. So when you’re using Focus, your status will be automatically displayed in Messages. And for truly urgent messages, there’s still a way for people to notify you.
Across all your devicesEnable Focus on one of your devices and it’s automatically set across all of them.
Quick Note and NotesIntroducing Quick NoteNotes is your go‑to app to capture any thought — and with the new Quick Note feature, you can jot down ideas no matter where you are or what you’re doing on your Mac. It’s like writing a note directly on whatever app you’re working in.
Put anything in a Quick NoteAdd links, Safari highlights, tags, and mentions to a Quick Note, so you can get to important names, numbers, and ideas easily.
Finding your Quick Note is easyIn supported apps, you can add links to a Quick Note and a thumbnail of your note will always show up there when you go back. Quick Notes also appear together in the Notes app — whether you’re on your Mac, iPad, or iPhone.
Activity view and mentionsAn all-new Activity view lets you see what others have added to your shared note. And you can notify members in shared notes with mentions. Just type someone’s name in a note to send them a notification.
Organize with tagsTag a note using the # symbol and a keyword you can search, then find it later in the Tag Browser.
Even better together.

8Shortcuts on MacShortcuts appAutomate the things you do most often.

You can run them from your Dock, menu bar, the Finder, Spotlight, or even with Siri.
Shortcuts appThe future of Mac isn’t just bright — it’s intelligent. Shortcuts build on the capabilities of the Automator app. Now you can modernize and convert your existing Automator workflows into shortcuts.

4PrivacyIt’s more important than ever to know how your privacy is being protected. Get greater visibility into how and when apps access your mic. And keep senders from learning about your activity in Mail.
Recording indicatorControl Center lets you find out which apps have access to your mic. And you’ll see the new indicator on your screen whenever an app is accessing your microphone.
Mail Privacy ProtectionCatch up on email with more peace of mind.
Mail Privacy ProtectionMail Privacy Protection hides your IP address, so senders can’t link it to your other online activity or determine your location. And it prevents senders from seeing if and when you’ve opened their email.
iCloud+iCloud has always kept your important information — like photos, documents, and notes — safe, up to date, and accessible across all your devices. Now iCloud+ takes that experience a step further, with an all-new subscription that will replace today’s storage plans.
10Introducing iCloud+Get everything you already love about iCloud — and new features including iCloud Private Relay, Hide My Email, and expanded HomeKit Secure Video support.
11iCloud Private RelayBrowse the web with more privacy.
iCloud Private RelayiCloud Private Relay is a service that lets you connect to virtually any network and browse with Safari in an even more secure and private way. It ensures that the traffic leaving your device is encrypted and uses two separate internet relays so no one can use your IP address, location, and browsing activity to create a detailed profile about you.
12Hide My EmailInstantly generate unique, random email addresses that forward to your personal inbox — so you don’t have to share your real email address when filling out a form on the web or signing up for a newsletter. Hide My Email is built into Mail,13Safari, and iCloud Preferences.
And so much more.
AirPods audio updates.
When you connect AirPods Pro, AirPods Max, or AirPods (3rd generation) to Mac models with the M1 chip, Spatial Audio and dynamic head tracking help deliver a theater‑like experience with sound that surrounds you. Sound stays fixed to the device even as you move your head. If you’re watching a movie, you’ll hear the engine roar right from the car, or hear dialogue straight from the actors’ mouths. With music, you’ll hear the mix exactly as intended.
Low Power Mode.
Extend your MacBook battery life with Low Power Mode, which manages energy-intensive apps and processing. It directs power where you need it to get the most out of your battery.
14System-Wide Translation.
Translate text almost anywhere, even in many third party apps. Just highlight text, right‑click, and select Translate to immediately see the translation. With Live Text, you can even translate text in photos.
Apple ID.
Account Recovery Contacts makes resetting your password and maintaining access to your account easier than ever. And a new Digital Legacy program*lets you designate people as Legacy Contacts so they can access your account in the event of your death.
