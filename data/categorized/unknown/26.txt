Research Faculty Scientific Service Units Staff Scientists Library Research Funding Responsible Research Publications Research Institute of Science and Technology Austria (ISTA) is a cross-disciplinary research institution that combines basic science research with graduate education. Our scientists perform theoretical and experimental research in Mathematical and Physical Sciences , Life Sciences , and Information and System Sciences.
 They are organized in small to medium-size research groups that interact with each other across the boundaries of traditional disciplines. Each research group of ISTA is headed by a tenured or tenure-track professor. Below you can find a list of all our professors leading laboratories at ISTA.
