Computer VisionBoth ‘at-the-edge’ and in the cloud, we train computers to identify and process images in the same way that human vision does, and then provide appropriate output/insights.
Machine LearningWe train computer algorithms to handle new situations via analysis, self-learning, observation and experience—removing manual identification of features in data.
NLPWe train computers to understand and read human text—bridging the translation gap between human languages and computer code—and opening a world of possibilities.
Speech ProcessingWe train computers to artificially simulate human speech, to convert speech into text or text into speech, or to analyze an audio signal to extract insights and meaning.
