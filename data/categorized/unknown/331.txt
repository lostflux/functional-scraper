Avery Johnson was a highly trained Marine, serving with various combat units of theNaval Special Warfare Command, including the highly classifiedORION Project.
Johnson played a vital role during the course of the Great War and fought at major battles such asHarvest,Reach,Earth, and the events atInstallation 04,05, and at theArk. He was key in forming an alliance between the Humans andSangheilifollowing theGreat Schismand the outbreak of theFloodinNovember 2552. Ultimately, Johnson was killed in an attempt to prematurely activate areplacement Haloby343 Guilty Spark. He was honored byFleet Admiral Sir Terrence Hoodtwice, first with theColonial Crossjust prior to the invasion of Earth; then just months later, alongside his fallen comrades, at theHillside MemorialinVoi,Kenya.
He was best known for his typical "gung-ho" attitude towards life, personal goals, and as a leader to his fellow Marines. This earned him a reputation, respect, and admiration from his subordinates and superiors alike. He also took a liking to "flip music," a style of music similar to theheavy metalfrom the 21st century. Avery Johnson is also noted as being one of a select few outside of theSPARTAN-II Programto befriendMaster Chief Petty OfficerJohn-117, whom he fought alongside multiple times throughout the final months of the Human-Covenant War; ultimately dying in his arms after being critically injured.
ContentsBiographyChildhoodAvery Junior Johnson was born in the sprawling industrial section ofChicago,Illinoisnear the Great Lakes in theUnited States of America.
[6]His family broke up when he was six years old and he was placed in the care of his aunt byZone Protective Services.
[7]One situation that Johnson had fond memories of was his first day of church, as his Aunt tried her best to get the large shoes and small clothes of his cousins to fit him. Her religious beliefs were carried on by Johnson and often made him question his own decision to kill otherhuman beings, even long after her death. However, he had no qualms about fighting theCovenantand fought actively in several campaigns to protect humanity from their threat.
Early Military CareerFiles onOperation: KALEIDOSCOPE.
Johnson enlisted in theUNSC Marine Corpswhen he was nineteen and was soon thrown into theInsurrection.
[8]His name was dubiously associated with dozens of black operations and programs, including assignment to the highly classified combat unit calledORION Project, which performed "enhancement" procedures on volunteer troops, which would later retroactively be renamed SPARTAN-I. Johnson was also known to have participated on missions codenamedTANGLEWOODandKALEIDOSCOPE.
[9]The files that contain the records of his involvement with the ORION Program were subsequently covered up byONI Section Zero, and anyone who tries to access them is automatically sent a fake file marked "\P_BS48789-2011-AJ.txt," also known as the "Paris/BS Spoof" File.
[5]He was a graduate of theNaval Special Warfare Sniper School, where he exceeded the expectations of his superiors, and received training inHuman Entry Vehicleorbital drops,[10]andCQB(Close Quarters Battle), while serving inNavSpecWar. He also served as a Squad Leader on many black operations missions during the Insurrection.
[11]In2524, Johnson participated inOperation: TREBUCHET, leadingAlpha Squadand a platoon ofNAVSPECWARMarines alongsideStaff SergeantNolan Byrne. Their squads usedHornetsto conduct air assaults on multiple targets in efforts to eliminateRebelbomb making factories. However, when a rebel (armed with a bomb) was cornered in aJim Dandyrestaurant, Byrne told Johnson to fire anM99 Special Application Scoped Rifle, (aka Gauss rifle), at anInsurrectionistholding a child hostage. Sgt. Johnson did not have a clear shot at the rebel, and his hesitation led to a civilian (the child's father trying to rescue his son) tackling the female rebel, who then detonated her explosives, which destroyed the Jim Dandy restaurant, along with all of the Marines in Byrne's squad (except Byrne himself), and thirty-eight civilians. Byrne would hold a great deal of animosity towards Johnson for quite some time as a result of this incident.
After the incident, Johnson came home and found his Aunt Marcille dead of natural causes, and soon went on a massive drinking binge. He started a brawl with bouncers at a Chicago club, and ended up in a gutter until he was found byLieutenant Downs, aUNSC Marine Corpsrecruiter. He was reassigned to planet Harvest byJilan al-Cygni.
Human-Covenant WarStaff Sergeant Avery J. Johnson passing a field with theHarvest Colonial Militia.
Johnson was reassigned to train theColonial Militiaon Harvest. They were assigned to a secret mission to create a covert anti-insurgency unit, and to lay an ambush on insurgent forces suspected in the disappearances of DCS freighters aroundHarvest. However, while lying in wait on a bait freighter, he and Sergeant Byrne, who was also assigned to the position, fought and defeated fourbird-like extraterrestrialsin the first official battle between the UNSC and theCovenant. Johnson and Byrne (with the rest of the militia of Harvest) were also present at the initial negotiations between theJiralhanaeand theHumans. They also fought Jiralhanae ChieftainMaccabeus, his nephewTartarus, and severalUnggoy. He aidedStaff SergeantByrne and ONI operativeLt. Cdr.
Jilan al-Cygniin repelling theJiralhanaeshipRapid Conversionlong enough to allow most of the planet's population to escape into theTiara, a station attached to seven different space elevators stationed on the planet. Later, he would have a romance with al-Cygni after escaping from the planet. Although Johnson and al-Cygni seemed quite taken with each other it is unclear whether they formed a relationship, or how long it lasted.
Operation Silent StormOn March 7 of2526, Johnson was recalled to theUNSC Everestto participate in a gathering of officers, including admiralPreston Coleand Dr.
Catherine Halseyto planOperation: SILENT STORM. There he found out for the first time theSPARTAN-II Programand gave his advice about the Covenant's forces and tactics. After the gathering, he was assigned toBlue Teamas advisor, meeting for first timeJohn-117. His experience, especially about relationships with their officers, helped to reduce frictions with ODST forces, who also participated in SILENT STORM, an operation against the Covenant's logistic bases.
[12]Johnson fought alongside Blue Team in an assault against an insurrectionist base in Biko's moon, and later, in the assault of the Covenant's main logistical base. There, he assisted Colonel Crowther to arrest an Insurrectionist leader, Captain Nyeto. However, he could not prevent the colonel from being murdered by the late Captain's crew.
[13]When Nyeto's forces attempted to attack the SPARTANs, Johnson activated his emergency beacon, attracting the Covenant forces to fight Nyeto's. He was forced into a last stand, but was eventually rescued along with the ODSTs.
[14]Paris IVWhen the Covenant attacked Paris IV, Johnson fought valiantly; during the battle, he repossessed a crate of Covenantplasma grenadesand used them all against the enemy troops to keep them at bay so his fellow soldiers could evacuate. He received a commendation for bravery, and a twelve-hundred-rad cumulative dose of radiation as an unanticipated "bonus" from all the plasma detonations.
[15][5][16]During the UNSC evacuation of Paris IV and theParis system, Johnson managed to rescue a little girl namedMolly Patelfrom a crashed car inCochineal Pass.
[17]Molly would grow up viewing Johnson as a role model, hoping one day to be the hero she viewed in him.
[18]Fall of Reach"You have two choices, private! You can die screaming like a little girl! Or you can die fighting like a Marine!" -Johnson in Reach Station Gamma.
After theSiege of Paris IV, he was assigned toReach Station Gamma, an orbital station above the planetReach, one of Humanity's biggest and most important colonies. While he was stationed there, a massive Covenant armada arrived, starting one of thelargest engagementsof the Human-Covenant War. During the battle, Johnson led a search and destroy team aboard the station, made up ofPFCWallace Jenkins, andPrivatesBisentiandO'Brien. They were surrounded and outgunned by the attackingKig-YarandSangheili, but were saved from annihilation by the unexpected arrival ofSPARTAN-IIs,Master Chief Petty OfficerJohn-117, andPetty Officer Second ClassLinda-058. They boarded aPelican, going to the core of the station, with Johnson piloting it. The marines assisted the Spartans in the realization of their key mission: to deny the Covenant a path to Earth.
[19]Later, all escaped onto theUNSCPillar of Autumn, which fled the battle intoSlipspace.
Battle of Installation 04Sergeant Johnson on theUNSCPillar of Autumn.
When coming out of Slipspace, thePillar of Autumncame across aForerunnercreation known asHalo. The Covenant, cautious not to damage the ring world by firing at theAutumnin space, began boarding actions to neutralize theAutumn. On board, Johnson helped defend theAutumnfrom the invading Covenant boarding troops, but like everyone else, was forced to abandon ship whenCaptainJacob Keyesissued the order. Johnson was reported to be the last to leave the ship, ensuring that as many of the ship's crew - Marines and Navy personnel alike - made it off the Autumn as possible.
Sergeant Johnsonâ€™s escape pod and hissquadsuccessfully landed on the ring with most of his Marines alive. However, as soon as they geared up, Covenant strike teams viciously attacked them. With his platoon scattered all over the valley, he was glad to seeJohn-117coming up to assist in the nick of time.
[21]Johnson and Fire Team Charlie were evacuated byCaptainCarol "Foehammer" Rawley, and remained atAlpha Basefor some time until asked to join a mission, led by Captain Keyes, into the inner workings of Installation 04. The crew intercepted a Covenant transmission detailing the transport of numerous weapons to somewhere in the swampy regions of Installation 04. This, as well as acaptured Sangheili'stestimony of a large weapons cache located in a swamp, prompted Keyes to investigate. Johnson, being an experienced and respected Marine Sergeant, accompanied the Captain along with his squad.

Shortly after they were dropped off, the squad came across a structure leading underground. As they ventured further into the facility, they came across several Sangheili corpses with scrambled innards. Passing them off as friendly fire, they proceeded deeper into the facility until they entered a seemingly empty room. Irritated byPrivateManuel Mendoza'sparanoia, Johnson shrugged off the situation until massive numbers of Flood Infection Forms broke out of the nearby holding cells and attacked the squad. As each Marine fell, save for himself andPrivate Bisenti, Johnson was forced to attack and kill a few of his own men, who were mutating before his eyes and would have killed him if he had done otherwise, but eventually fought his way out of the nightmare. He was presumed dead afterJohn-117found a helmet recorder entry from Private Jenkins, showing the gory details of the Marines' fates (cutting out after an infection form attacked Jenkins, knocking off his helmet), but later escaped after John-117 foundCorporalLovikand the remains of his Marine team.
The Flood attempted to infect Johnson but he was able to shrug off the effects due to the complications of hisBoren's Syndrome.
[22]Operation FIRST STRIKEJohnson met up withLt.
Elias Haverson,Cpl.
Locklear, andPO2Sheila Polaski, after escaping Halo's destruction in aPelican, moments before it collapsed in multiple explosions. Polaski piloted the dropship away from the ring, meeting up with aC709 Longsword-class Starfightercarrying John-117 and Cortana, who had also escaped the Flood and Halo. Having seen Jenkinsâ€™ video himself, SPARTAN-117 was alarmed by Johnsonâ€™s appearance and promptly pulled Johnson's ownM6D Pistoland pointed it to his head. Johnson had expressed no objection, and assured the Spartan that he was fine and not infected by the Flood, although it took Cortana's intervention to convince John that Johnson was still human.
Without a viable way to return to the nearest safe outpost, it was decided that the new crew would take over the nearest Covenant ship in the vicinity, theAscendant Justice, a Covenant capital ship. John-117 assumed command due to his higher-priority mission, although Lieutenant Haverson was the ranking officer, and Johnson assisted John-117 by helping him assert control over Corporal Locklear and Haverson. After they boarded theAscendant Justice, Johnson and the others made their way through the ship towards the bridge, where he witnessed a showdown between John-117 and aSangheili, where he brought down the alienâ€™s shields in order for SPARTAN-117 to push the Sangheili into an escape pod and send it away from the ship.
After they had captured the Covenant ship, not being able to return to Earth because of theCole Protocol, John-117 suggested they return to Reach to regroup. They proceeded with this plan despite protests that Reach was almost certainly a dead world. When they arrived at Reach, the planet was almost completely glassed, except for a small portion. Using aCovenant dropship, they traveled to the surface of the desecrated planet, where Johnson was becoming nervous. After they landed, they found the survivingSPARTAN-IIsandDr. Catherine Halsey. Johnson was the first to realize that they were surrounded by thousands of invisible Covenant, and pointed it out toVice AdmiralWhitcombbefore their dropship walked into the trap.
After a harrowing escape, Johnson accompanied the new and growing crew as the ship moved through Slipspace. Unknown to him, Dr. Halsey and John-117 were reviewing his medical files. They matched Johnsonâ€™s survival against the Flood to his Borenâ€™s Syndrome. Flood DNAwaspresent in Johnsonâ€™s blood, but it was dormant and non-infectious. Halsey also confirmed that Johnson had gained some unique regenerative abilities as a side effect from the attempted assimilation back on Halo when they accidentally opened the Flood Containment Facility. Halsey had prepared two separate documents forONI Section Threeto review:Halsey placed the decision of which data crystal to give to ONI in John's hands. If he gave them the first crystal, ONI would probably have dissected Johnson in an attempt to figure out how he resisted the Flood, killing the Sergeant. John had thought at first that the first crystal held the better solution, despite it essentially being a death sentence for his friend, but later decided to save Johnson's life by crushing the first crystal.
Although Johnson's involvement in Operation: FIRST STRIKE was minimal, he came up with the idea to attack the Covenant space stationUnyielding Hierophantin order to delay the Covenant from finding Earth. Johnson continued to be of assistance when the Spartans began the mission, staying behind with Cortana in the damagedUNSCGettysburgwhile they charged head-on into the Covenant ship after the operation.
End of the WarInvasion of EarthSergeant Major Avery Johnson is presented with TheColonial Crossalong with Master ChiefJohn-117.
Most of the crew returned to Earth safely, and they were given time to rest and were debriefed on their experiences. AboardCairo orbital station, Johnson was promoted toSergeant Majorand was awarded theColonial CrossbyLord Terrence Hoodfor his actions on Halo. During the ceremony, a Covenant excavation fleet, led by theProphet of Regret, arrived atEarth, sparking theBattle of Earth.
Johnson aided in the defense of theCairoalong with John-117. As the Spartan led the human forces deeper into the station, Johnson andCommanderMiranda Keyes, the daughter of the deceased Jacob Keyes, boarded theUNSC frigateUNSCIn Amber Clad.
[24]As they arrived on the surface, Cortana intercepted data that pointed towards one of the Covenantâ€™s spiritual leaders being present in the invasion. Johnson led Pelicans full of marines into battle, but they were shot down by a CovenantScarabbefore they got close to theCAS-class assault carrierthat carried the High Prophet of Regret. Wielding asniper rifle, Johnson fought in the residential district of the city, providing cover fire and serving as a lookout. As John-117 went on to findMarinesfrom another downed Pelican, Johnson stayed back and joined the rescue units to provide cover. Viewing the Scarab as a threat to the mission, he returned toUNSCIn Amber Cladto bring aScorpiontank for John to use in a front line assault against the Covenant invasion force.
[4]After the destruction of the Scarab, Johnson picked up John and brought him back intoIn Amber Clad, which pulled up next to the massive Covenant ship just as it took off intoSlipspace, the human vessel being close enough to "piggyback" along on the same jump.
[4]The Great SchismComing out of Slipspace, Johnson was shocked to learn that there was another Halo, nearly choking on his ever-present cigar. Determined to find and capture the Prophet of Regret, Commander Keyes ordered SPARTAN-117 to clear a landing zone and the Sergeant to take two flights of Pelicans and land on the ring. Johnson carried out the orders and followed John and a small detachment ofOrbital Drop Shock Troopersonto the surface, providing artillery and troops by means of dropships to fight the Covenant stationed in the ringâ€™s ancient temples.
[25]During the mission, Cortana translated a message from Regret being broadcast on the Covenant network, and learned that Regret planned to activate the Halo, which would wipe out all life in the galaxy. Pulling information gathered from the first Halo, Keyes found the location ofDelta Haloâ€™s library, housing theIndexwhich was needed to activate the ring. She ordered Johnson to extract his troops and return toIn Amber Cladfor reassignment.
Johnson and a group of his best Marines joined Commander Keyes on a search for the Index. As they neared the center of the massive structure, the small unit was attacked by a large amount of Flood. They dug in and fought the creatures off, finally locating the Index. Johnson helped Keyes grab the key, but before they headed out, they were attacked byThel 'Vadamee, the CovenantArbiter, who had activated his camouflage to hide from the Humans. Johnson was quickly incapacitated and captured by the Jiralhanae ChieftainTartarus, and brought to the Covenant capital city,High Charity.
Johnson and Keyes were held in the Covenant city ofHigh Charity, until theHigh Prophet of Truthinstructed Tartarus to activate the ring and initiate theGreat Journey. Tartarus ordered his Jiralhanae to split Johnson, Keyes, and the capturedOracleinto two differentPhantoms. Johnson was joined byStaff SergeantMarcus BanksandGunnery SergeantMarcus Stackerfor an execution by a pack of Jiralhanae. Moments before their deaths, the Arbiter and his squad burst out of the nearby structure and attacked the Jiralhanae, distracting them long enough for Johnson and his Marines to board the nearby Scarab walker.

After the executioners were killed, Johnson and his Marines commandeered the Scarab, and confronted 'Vadamee. They both agreed that Tartarus needed to be stopped. Johnson suggested that 'Vadamee commandeer aBansheeto provide air support. After that, they joined forces and traveled through the canyon towards theControl Room. Knowing the brute strength of the Scarab's main weapon, Johnson fired at the heavily armored door, shattering it with ease. Arming himself with aParticle Beam Rifle, Johnson followed the Arbiter inside alone.
He arrived during the Arbiter's confrontation with Tartarus. He aimed his Beam Rifle at the Jiralhanaeâ€™s head, keeping him from forcing Keyes to insert the Index. Tartarus threw343 Guilty Sparkat Johnson, knocking him over. Swiftly, he forcedMiranda Keyesto insert the Index into the control panel, starting the firing process. The Arbiter and his squad of Sangheili challenged Tartarus, and Johnson provided backup, using his Beam Rifle to bring down the chieftainâ€™s shields. With his shields down, 'Vadamee was able to kill Tartarus, thereby allowing Keyes to grab the Index and stop the Halo array from firing.
With the remainder of the Sangheili squad keeping the area secure,343 Guilty Sparkexplained to Johnson, Keyes, and 'Vadamee that the other Installations were in a sort of "standby mode," still ready to fire. This is a fail-safe if one of the Halo installations misfires. This allowed them all to be activated remotely fromthe Ark.
[26]ReturnVergillights a cigar for Johnson.
While most of theFleet of Retributionremained to maintain the quarantine of High Charity, Johnson, Commander Keyes and the Arbiter returned to Earth on one of the fleet's vessels and arrived before theForerunner dreadnoughtwith John-117 on board.
[28]During the Arrival of Truth's Fleet, anODST Squadmanaged to capture aHuragok. Avery Johnson, with clearance fromLord Hoodinterrogated the Huragok to find out what Truth was searching for inNew Mombasa, as he was "digging a mighty big hole."[27]When John-117 crash-landed on Earth, he was met by Johnson, the Arbiter, and a squad of Marines. After a few minutes of hiking through the jungle, he and his squad split off from John-117 and the Arbiter after encountering enemy Phantoms, reasoning that they would be safer apart than together. Johnson and his team proceeded to continue through the woods, and arrived at the evacuation site several moments before the Arbiter and John-117. However, enemy Banshees soon discovered the awaiting Pelicans, and he was shot down, crash landing about a kilometer away. He and the surviving Marines were forced to flee pursuing Jiralhanae. At some point Johnson and his men were captured. After being freed by John-117 and the Arbiter, he grabbed the nearest weapon and helped fend off incoming Covenant untilHocus, a Pelican pilot, came to the rescue. Hocus eventually arrived, destroying two Phantoms that were pinning Sergeant Johnson, John-117, the Arbiter, and the surviving Marines down. Johnson was evacuated along with the others.
[29]The group was brought to a UNSC base codenamedCrow's Nest, deep underground in the African jungle. There, they linked up with Commander Miranda Keyes, who briefed them on the situation. Midway through the briefing, while they were being told of Commander Keyes' plan of attack by Lord Terrence Hood on a video monitor, theProphet of Truthshut down the base's power and started speaking on the video monitor, telling the group that they would all, including their Demon (John-117), die. After the Prophet's tirade ended and the power came back on, Commander Keyes ordered the base evacuated. Johnson and some Marines stayed behind to defend the ops center, which had an armed bomb in it, while John-117 and the Arbiter went off to secure the perimeter. After much fighting, they were forced to return to the ops center, as Jiralhanae had overrun it. They stormed the ops center, re-armed the bomb, then quickly traveled through the base to an elevator that would take them to Johnson. Unfortunately, the bomb exploded before they could reach him.
Johnson warned John that the Covenant had uncovered what he thought was the Ark, and that the Humans had to get to it. Johnson provided air support for John-117, the Arbiter and Marine survivors, dropping off Warthogs so they could break through the Jiralhanae blockades. At one point, he dropped off severalMongooseATVs to assist them in destroying a Covenant Scarab. Johnson remained in a Pelican dropship for most, if not all of the Battle of Voi, dispersing armor and troops throughout the city as necessary to help push the Covenant back. He was present when John-117 retrieved a message from Cortana, who had been left behind on the Flood-infestedHigh Charity. Johnson was one of the Marines that followed the High Prophet of Truth to therealArk, which was located past theportalgenerated by the device the Covenant uncovered on Earth.
Assault on the ArkJohnson descended tothe Arkwith a half a dozen Pelicans along with John-117, and helped him secure a landing zone and stop the construction of an AA battery. He later brought in a platoon of Marines lead by Gunnery Sergeant Stacker, and some tanks from the frigate, helping throughout the mission, until the location of Truth was discovered from theCartographer.
[30]He then went on to command the second squad in taking down the third tower that was projecting the shield barrier protecting Truth in theCitadel. There, he, along with his squad, were overrun and captured by overwhelming Jiralhanae, Hunter and Drone forces. Johnson's squad was killed, and he was brought to the Citadel.
[31]The Prophet of Truth attempted to use Johnson to activate the Ark, and set off the Halo array, but he only taunted the Jiralhanae, in particular aChieftain, in hopes of angering the Jiralhanae to the point where he would kill him, and deny Truth the ability to activate the array. Miranda Keyes attempted to rescue him by crashing a Pelican through a large observatory window. Keyes was able to kill one Jiralhanae, a Chieftain, and fatally wounded another, but was surrounded. Realizing what the Prophet of Truth wished to use them for, Johnson told her that she should kill them both so they could not be used. While Keyes hesitated, Truth shot her in the back with aSpiker, killing her instantly. The disheartened Johnson was then forced to activate the Array. Johnson was rescued by John-117 and Thel 'Vadam, along with a horde of Flood. After John-117 deactivated the array, the Flood turned on the three, and while Johnson managed to escape on Keyes' Pelican with her body, John and the Arbiter were knocked off by the Gravemind, forced to fight their way back through the Flood.
[31]Death343 Guilty Spark mortally wounds Johnson as John-117 looks on.
After it was discovered thata Halowas located within the Ark, a plan was developed to activate that ring, which would destroy the Flood on the Ark, including the Gravemind, ending their threat once and for all, while simultaneously sparing the rest of the life in the galaxy. This was possible because Cortana still held within her the code to the Index from Installation 04, the first Halo. After John-117 invadedHigh Charityto recover Cortana, destroying the city on his way out,[33]Sergeant Johnson helped John-117 and the Arbiter fight through hordes of Flood to get to the control room of the new Halo, providing cover fire with aSpartan Laser. Johnson tried to activate the ring despite343 Guilty Spark's suggestion that they wait for it to be finished, which could take several days. Realizing that "his" ring was about to be destroyedagain, the Monitor turned on his allies, firing his sentinel beam into Johnson's front armor piece and fatally wounding him.
[32]While John-117 fought the rogue construct, Johnson used the last of his life and fired his laser, rendering Spark vulnerable. With a few choice words ("Kick his ass") he handed John hisweaponand fell unconscious. After the rogue AI was destroyed, Johnson gave John-117 thechipcontaining Cortana, and told him, "don't ever let her go." Despite John's promise that they would not leave him behind, the dying Johnson knew that he wasn't going to make it, requesting that John "send me out with a bang" before dying of his injuries. Following his wishes,John-117left his body in the Control Room as the ring activated, its unfinished state meaning that the activation sequence tore itself apart. Johnson's body was disintegrated in the explosion while Chief and Thel 'Vadam took Johnson's Warthog to escape on theForward Unto Dawn. Johnson's death brought condolences from Cortana and Thel 'Vadam, whom Johnson aided in his fight againstTartarus.
[32]OnMarch 3, 2553, a picture of him was seen among the fallen on theHillside Memorial.
[32]PersonalityAvery Johnson's behavior seems to be eccentric, often delivering outlandish speeches to boost the morale of those serving under him.
[20][4]However, when it came down to it, he was a no-nonsense NCO, who, although caring deeply for his troops, pushed them hard during training.
[34]Another seemingly peculiar aspect of his behavior is that he never consideredJohn-117or any of the otherSPARTAN-IIs"Section Three freaks" or "inhuman cyborgs." He had a large amount of respect for them, and appeared to respecteveryhuman fighting for humanity, as well as the Sangheili, once they joined forces with the UNSC in. In return, Thel 'Vadam respected him as well, before and after his death, saying sorrowfully to John, "I am sorry, Spartan" and "Even in death, your Sergeant guides us all."Johnson also has the tendency to give his enemies and enemy objects nicknames. Examples include: Guilty Spark being called Lightbulb and Tinkerbell, Tartarus being called Mr. Mohawk, and Unyielding Hierophant being called "Uneven Elephant."InHalo: Combat EvolvedandHalo 2, Johnson seemed energetic and well humored, often cracking jokes, puns, and insults at the expense of theCovenantor even in response to UNSC transmissions, as shown in the above quote.
InHalo 3, his serious and more "straight-to-the-point" side is seen more often, and he seems to fight more for the sake of getting it done, rather than enjoying himself as he did in. This may be due to age, his encounters with the Flood, the Human-Covenant War finally taking its toll on him, or a combination of the three.
Johnson seems to not be as tolerant of enemies or violent individuals asJohn-117, often comparing what the SPARTAN will do to them will be a "sweet sweet mercy compared to what [he'll] do to them."Johnson was known to have "chronic" nightmares, usually about his last mission.
[34]This is one of the many symptoms of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.
[35]Due to his rather eccentric behavior, it is quite uncertain whether or not Johnson fully retained his aunt's Christian beliefs. However, it is indeed possible that Johnson inherited his aunt's religious backround.
MedalsJohnson has received three known medals in his service: TheMedal of Honor,[32]theColonial Cross[24]and thePurple Heart.
[36]There is an additional medal attached to his picture on the Hillside Memorial, which appears to be the Navy Distinguished Service Medal.
[32]Johnson was not awarded any medals during his time with the ORION detachment, due to the sensitive nature of its missions.
