We design a joint differentially private variant of the popular Alternating-Least-Squares (ALS) method that achieves: i) (nearly) optimal sample complexity for matrix completion (in terms of number of items, users), and ii) the best known privacy/utility trade-off both theoretically, as well as on benchmark data sets. In particular, we provide the first global convergence analysis of ALS with noise introduced to ensure DP, and show that, in comparison to the best known alternative (the Private Frank-Wolfe algorithm by Jain et al. (2018)), our error bounds scale significantly better with respect to the number of items and users, which is critical in practical problems. Extensive validation on standard benchmarks demonstrate that the algorithm, in combination with carefully designed sampling procedures, is significantly more accurate than existing techniques, thus promising to be the first practical DP embedding model.
Recommender systems personalize content by recommending items to users. Item recommendation algorithms are evaluated by metrics that compare the positions of truly relevant items among the recommended items. To speed up the computation of metrics, recent work often uses sampled metrics where only a smaller set of random items and the relevant items are ranked. This paper investigates such sampled metrics and shows that they are inconsistent with their exact counterpart, in the sense that they do not persist relative statements, e.g., recommender A is better than B, not even in expectation. We show that it is possible to improve the quality of the sampled metrics by applying a correction. We conclude with an empirical evaluation of the naive sampled metrics and their corrected variants. Our work suggests that sampling should be avoided for metric calculation, however if an experimental study needs to sample, the proposed corrections can improve the estimates.
2020Many machine learning models involve mapping a score vector to a probability vector. Usually, this is done by projecting the score vector onto a probability simplex, and such projections are often characterized as Lipschitz continuous approximations of the argmax function, whose Lipschitz constant is controlled by a parameter that is similar to a softmax temperature. The aforementioned parameter has been observed to affect the quality of these models and is typically either treated as a constant or decayed over time. In this work, we propose a method that adapts this parameter to individual training examples. The resulting method exhibits desirable properties, such as sparsity of its support and numerically efficient implementation, and we find that it significantly outperforms competing non-adaptive projection methods. In our analysis, we also derive the general solution of (Bregman) projections onto the (n, k)â€“simplex, a result which may be of independent interest.
Recent results have shown that for two-layer fully connected neural networks, gradient flow converges to a global optimum in the infinite width limit, by making a connection between the mean field dynamics and the Wasserstein gradient flow. These results were derived for first-order gradient flow, and a natural question is whether second-order dynamics, i.e., dynamics with momentum, exhibit a similar guarantee. We show that the answer is positive for the heavy ball method. In this case, the resulting integro-PDE is a nonlinear kinetic Fokker Planck equation, and unlike the first-order case, it has no apparent connection with the Wasserstein gradient flow. Instead, we study the variations of a Lyapunov functional along the solution trajectories to characterize the stationary points and to prove convergence. While our results are asymptotic in the mean field limit, numerical simulations indicate that global convergence may already occur for reasonably small networks.
The task of item recommendation requires ranking a large catalogue of items given a context. Item recommendation algorithms are evaluated using ranking metrics that depend on the positions of relevant items. To speed up the computation of metrics, recent work often uses sampled metrics where only a smaller set of random items and the relevant items are ranked. This paper investigates sampled metrics in more detail and shows that they are inconsistent with their exact version, in the sense that they do not persist relative statements, e.g., recommender A is better than B, not even in expectation. Moreover, the smaller the sampling size, the less difference there is between metrics, and for very small sampling size, all metrics collapse to the AUC metric. We show that it is possible to improve the quality of the sampled metrics by applying a correction, obtained by minimizing different criteria such as bias or mean squared error. We conclude with an empirical evaluation of the naive sampled metrics and their corrected variants. To summarize, our work suggests that sampling should be avoided for metric calculation, however if an experimental study needs to sample, the proposed corrections can improve the quality of the estimate.
Embedding based models have been the state of the art in collaborative filtering for over a decade. Traditionally, the dot product or higher order equivalents have been used to combine two or more embeddings, e.g., most notably in matrix factorization. In recent years, it was suggested to replace the dot product with a learned similarity e.g. using a multilayer perceptron (MLP). This approach is often referred to as neural collaborative filtering (NCF). In this work, we revisit the experiments of the NCF paper that popularized learned similarities using MLPs. First, we show that with a proper hyperparameter selection, a simple dot product substantially outperforms the proposed learned similarities. Second, while a MLP can in theory approximate any function, we show that it is non-trivial to learn a dot product with an MLP. Finally, we discuss practical issues that arise when applying MLP based similarities and show that MLPs are too costly to use for item recommendation in production environments while dot products allow to apply very efficient retrieval algorithms. We conclude that MLPs should be used with care as embedding combiner and that dot products might be a better default choice.
We extend the idea of word pieces in natural language models to machine learning tasks on opaque ids. This is achieved by applying hash functions to map each id to multiple hash tokens in a much smaller space, similarly to a Bloom filter. We show that by applying a multi-layer Transformer to these Bloom filter digests, we are able to obtain models with high accuracy. They outperform models of a similar size without hashing and, to a large degree, models of a much larger size trained using sampled softmax with the same computational budget. Our key observation is that it is important to use a multi-layer Transformer for Bloom filter digests to remove ambiguity in the hashed input. We believe this provides an alternative method to solving problems with large vocabulary size.
2019Recommender system research suffers from a disconnect between the size of academic data sets and the scale of industrial production systems. In order to bridge that gap, we propose to generate large-scale user/item interaction data sets by expanding pre-existing public data sets. Our key contribution is a technique that expands user/item incidence matrices matrices to large numbers of rows (users), columns (items), and non-zero values (interactions). The proposed method adapts Kronecker Graph Theory to preserve key higher order statistical properties such as the fat-tailed distribution of user engagements, item popularity, and singular value spectra of user/item interaction matrices. Preserving such properties is key to building large realistic synthetic data sets which in turn can be employed reliably to benchmark recommender systems and the systems employed to train them. We further apply our stochastic expansion algorithm to the binarized MovieLens 20M data set, which comprises 20M interactions between 27K movies and 138K users. The resulting expanded data set has 1.2 B ratings, 2.2 M users, and 855K items, which can be scaled up or down.
We study the problem of learning similarity functions over very large corpora using neural network embedding models. These models are typically trained using SGD with random sampling of unobserved pairs, with a sample size that grows quadratically with the corpus size, making it expensive to scale. We propose new efficient methods to train these models without having to sample unobserved pairs. Inspired by matrix factorization, our approach relies on adding a global quadratic penalty and expressing this term as the inner-product of two generalized Gramians. We show that the gradient of this term can be efficiently computed by maintaining estimates of the Gramians, and develop variance reduction schemes to improve the quality of the estimates. We conduct large-scale experiments that show a significant improvement both in training time and generalization performance compared to sampling methods.
2018The routing game models congestion in transportation networks, communication networks, and other cyber-physical systems in which agents compete for shared resources. We consider an online learning model of player dynamics: at each iteration, every player chooses a route (or a probability distribution over routes, which corresponds to a flow allocation over the physical network), then the joint decision of all players determines the costs of each path, which are then revealed to the players.
We pose the following estimation problem: given a sequence of player decisions and the corresponding costs, we would like to estimate the parameters of the learning model. We consider, in particular, entropic mirror descent dynamics and reduce the problem to estimating the learning rates of each player.
In order to demonstrate our methods, we developed a web application that allows players to participate in a distributed, online routing game, and we deployed the application on Amazon Mechanical Turk. When players log in, they are assigned an origin and destination on a shared network. They can choose, at each iteration, a distribution over their available routes, and each player seeks to minimize her own cost. We collect a dataset using this platform, then apply the proposed method to estimate the learning rates of each player. We observe, in particular, that after an exploration phase, the joint decision of the players remains within a small distance of the set of equilibria. We also use the estimated model parameters to predict the flow distribution over routes, and compare our predictions to the actual distributions, showing that the online learning model can be used as a predictive model over short horizons. Finally, we discuss some of the qualitative insights from the experiments, and give directions for future research.
We consider the System Optimal Dynamic Traffic Assignment (SO-DTA) problem with Partial Control for general networks with physical queuing. Our goal is to optimally control any subset of the networks agents to minimize the total congestion of all agents in the network. We adopt a flow dynamics model that is a Godunov discretization of the Lighthillâ€“Williamsâ€“Richards partial differential equation with a triangular flux function and a corresponding multicommodity junction solver. The partial control formulation generalizes the SO-DTA problem to consider cases where only a fraction of the total flow can be controlled, as may arise in the context of certain incentive schemes. This leads to a nonconvex multicommodity optimization problem. We define a multicommodity junction model that only requires full Lagrangian paths for the controllable agents, and aggregate turn ratios for the noncontrollable (selfish) agents. We show how the resulting finite horizon nonlinear optimal control problem can be efficiently solved using the discrete adjoint method, leading to gradient computations that are linear in the size of the state space and the controls.
2017201620152014ThesisOnline learning and convex optimization algorithms have become essential tools for solving problems in modern machine learning, statistics and engineering. Many algorithms for online learning and convex optimization can be interpreted as a discretization of a continuous time process, and studying the continuous time dynamics offers many advantages: the analysis is often simpler and more elegant in continuous time, it provides insights and leads to new interpretations of the discrete process, and streamlines the design of new algorithms, obtained by deriving the dynamics in continuous time, then discretizing. In this thesis, we apply this paradigm to two problems: the study of decision dynamics for online learning in games, and the design and analysis of accelerated methods for convex optimization.
In the first part of the thesis, we study online learning dynamics for a class of games called non-atomic convex potential games, which are used for example to model congestion in transportation and communication networks. We make a connection between the discrete Hedge algorithm for online learning, and an ODE on the simplex, known as the replicator dynamics. We study the asymptotic properties of the ODE, then by discretizing the ODE and using results from stochastic approximation theory, we derive a new class of online learning algorithms with asymptotic convergence guarantees. We further give a more refined analysis of these dynamics and their convergence rates. Then, using the Hedge algorithm as a model of decision dynamics, we pose and study two related problems: the problem of estimating the learning rates of the Hedge algorithm given observations on its sequence of decisions, and the problem of optimal control under Hedge dynamics.
In the second part, we study first-order accelerated dynamics for constrained convex optimization. We develop a method to design an ODE for the problem using an inverse Lyapunov argument: we start from an energy function that encodes the constraints of the problem and the desired convergence rate, then design an ODE tailored to that energy function. Then, by carefully discretizing the ODE, we obtain a family of accelerated algorithms with optimal rate of convergence. This results in a unified framework to derive and analyze most known first-order methods, from gradient descent and mirror descent to their accelerated versions. We give different interpretations of the ODE, inspired from physics and statistics. In particular, we give an averaging interpretation of accelerated dynamics, and derive simple sufficient conditions on the averaging scheme to guarantee a given rate of convergence. We also develop an adaptive averaging heuristic that empirically speeds up the convergence, and in many cases performs significantly better than popular heuristics such as restarting.
