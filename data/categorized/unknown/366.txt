PhysicsMathematicsBiologyComputer ScienceTopicsArchiveWhat's up inmachine learningalgorithmsPowerful ‘Machine Scientists’ Distill the Laws of Physics From Raw DataByCharlie WoodRead LaterResearchers say we’re on the cusp of “GoPro physics,” where a camera can point at an event and an algorithm can identify the underlying physics equation.
mathematical physicsDeep Learning Poised to ‘Blow Up’ Famed Fluid EquationsByJordana CepelewiczRead LaterFor centuries, mathematicians have tried to prove that Euler’s fluid equations can produce nonsensical answers. A new approach to machine learning has researchers betting that “blowup” is near.
artificial intelligenceMachine Learning Reimagines the Building Blocks of ComputingByNick ThiemeRead LaterTraditional algorithms power complicated computational tools like machine learning. A new approach, called algorithms with predictions, uses the power of machine learning to improve algorithms.
machine learningIn New Math Proofs, Artificial Intelligence Plays to WinByLeila SlomanRead LaterA new computer program fashioned after artificial intelligence systems like AlphaGo has solved several open problems in combinatorics and graph theory.
neural networksAI Overcomes Stumbling Block on Brain-Inspired HardwareByAllison WhittenRead LaterAlgorithms that use the brain’s communication signal can now work on analog neuromorphic chips, which closely mimic our energy-efficient brains.
machine learningMachine Learning Becomes a Mathematical CollaboratorByKelsey Houston-EdwardsRead LaterTwo recent collaborations between mathematicians and DeepMind demonstrate the potential of machine learning to help researchers generate new mathematical conjectures.
artificial intelligenceComputer Scientists Prove Why Bigger Neural Networks Do BetterByMordechai RorvigRead LaterTwo researchers show that for neural networks to be able to remember better, they need far more parameters than previously thought.
quantum physicsQuantum Complexity Tamed by Machine LearningByCharlie WoodRead LaterIf only scientists understood exactly how electrons act in molecules, they’d be able to predict the behavior of everything from experimental drugs to high-temperature superconductors. Following decades of physics-based insights, artificial intelligence systems are taking the next leap.
machine learningMachine Learning Gets a Quantum SpeedupByMax G. LevyRead LaterTwo teams have shown how quantum approaches can solve problems faster than classical computers, bringing physics and computer science closer together.
