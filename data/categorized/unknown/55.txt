Meet past scholarsWe asked the past recipients of the DeepMind scholarships to tell us a little about themselves, and what the DeepMind scholarships have meant for their studies.
Past scholarsSneha NaikMSc in Artificial IntelligenceI completed my undergraduate degree in Natural Sciences (Physics) at the University of Cambridge in 2017.
After graduating, I worked in Investment Banking (Debt Capital Markets and Derivatives). While I was working I was exposed to the rapidly growing FinTech sector and through this, became increasingly fascinated by the real-world applications of Machine Learning and Data Science. I therefore decided to pursue a Masters in Artificial Intelligence at Imperial.
The MSc in Artificial Intelligence is making it possible for me to deepen my core computing skills through practical software engineering projects, while diving into specialised topics such as Reinforcement Learning and Natural Language processing and I am thoroughly enjoying every second of it!I am extremely grateful to have received a DeepMind Scholarship. Not only has the scholarship provided me with financial support, but also, through the invaluable mentorship scheme, the confidence to achieve my future career goals.
Hongshu LiuMSc in ComputingI completed my undergraduate and master degrees in Actuarial Science and Finance at London and Cambridge. Iâ€™m currently studying the MSc in Computing at Imperial.
After graduating, I worked in actuarial consulting. Towards the later stage of my last job, I was more involved in projects related to data analysis and modelling, and this experience showed me the path into the computer science. I therefore decided to pursue a computer science degree and possibly a related research opportunity afterwards.
The DeepMind Scholarship gives me the support I need. It has also brought me into contact with some of the best experts in the industry and inspires me to explore this new path. This invaluable experience will help me to grow and achieve my goals and I feel really lucky to be given this opportunity.
