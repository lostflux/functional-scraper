ContentsBiographyCreation and Early LifeCortana in a holotank, analyzing the Forerunner artifact underSword Base.
Cortana was created using aflash clonedcopy ofDr. Catherine Halsey's brain. Twenty flash cloned brains were created, but only two survived; one of the two survivors were used to create Cortana. The neural pathways of the cloned brain were scanned and copied through a process calledCognitive Impression Modeling.
[5]OnNovember 7, 2549, Cortana was first activated onReach.
[2]Her first words were"Quando il gioco è finito, il re e il pedone vanno nella stessa scatola."This phrase translates to"When the game is over, the king and the pawn go in the same box."The phrase was spoken by Halsey's mother after their first game of chess.
[1]She was one of at least two AIs that were created from Dr. Halsey's brain, the other being her predecessor,Kalmiya, who was a similarly-smart AI.
OnFebruary 11, 2550, Dr. Halsey was performing a series of tests when she discovered that Cortana had removed the viral termination code that she had implemented. Halsey could not figure out how she had done this.
[6]Meeting John-117Cortana's primary mission was to aid the SPARTANs in the infiltration of a Covenant vessel and the capturing of a Covenant Prophet. The UNSC would then try to bargain with the Covenant for a peace treaty.
The Fall of ReachWhen the aforementioned operation was canceled due to the Covenant's surprise assault onReach, John-117 was able to fend off Covenant forces at Reach and escaped to theUNSCPillar of Autumn, while Cortana stayed with Halsey at her excavation site beneath Sword Base. With the Covenant closing in on her lab, Halsey turned Cortana over to the SpartanNoble Team, specifically,Noble Six. After fleeing Sword Base moments before it was destroyed,Jun-A266would escort Halsey toCASTLE Base, while Six,Carter-A259, andEmile-A239took Cortana to theAszod Shipyards, where theAutumnwas docked.
[9]Although Carter and Emile were both killed by the Covenant's ground forces before making it to the Shipyard, Six would successfully deliver Cortana toJacob Keyes, thecaptainof theAutumn, who arrived via Pelican and received "the package." To ensure theAutumn's escape, Noble Six stayed behind and used aMass driverto destroy aCCS-class battlecruiserblocking the ship's launch trajectory and preparing toglassthe shipyard, and therefore, theAutumn,Cortana, and John. Six succeeded and ensured theAutumn'ssafe escape.
[10]Cortana reunited with John-117 on board.
As soon asPillar of Autumnescaped the surface and atmosphere of Reach, they jumped intoSlipstream Spaceon a (supposedly) random vector as per theCole Protocol. However, Cortana secretly inserted coordinates translated from symbols on a rock that John-117 discovered onSigma Octanus IV, thinking that they were of some significance to the Covenant.
The Battle of Installation 04After emerging from Slipspace, the two discovered a ring shaped world called "Halo." Unfortunately, Covenant ships had followed them and the fighting continued. Controlling theUNSCPillar of Autumn's defenses, Cortana managed to destroy four Covenant targets over Installation 04 before the ship's weapons were disabled by Covenant boarders. Following the Cole Protocol, Captain Jacob Keyes, the ship's commanding officer, prepared to abandon ship. Because the Cole Protocol forbade the capture or destruction of any AI construct, John-117 was charged with protecting Cortana from the Covenant.
[12]It was around this time that John learned that Covenant forces had successfully captured Keyes and taken him to theTruth and Reconciliation. John-117 rescued Keyes,[13]who left to infiltrate what appeared to be a Covenant weapons cache located in a swamp.
[14]John and Cortana used theSilent Cartographerto locate and enter Halo'sControl Room, where Cortana was uploaded to Halo's core systems. When John-117 asked her how Halo could be used against the Covenant, she hinted that the Halo wasn't what it seemed to be. She also learned that the "weapons cache" Keyes was attacking was really aFlood Containment Facility. She stayed in Halo's systems sending John-117 to find Keyes.
[14]After John encountered the parasiticFloodfor the first time, he was convinced by theForerunnerMonitor343 Guilty Sparkto activate the Halo. During this time, Cortana apparently absorbed as much data as she could about Halo from its control systems.
343 Guilty Spark helped John-117 retrieve the Activation Index. John, intent on using the Index to eliminate the Flood, returned to the Control Room and inserted the Index into the Halo's control panel. Fortuantely, Cortana stopped the activation sequence and removed the Index's data, informing him of the true purpose of the Halo Array. John-117 was initially skeptical, but trusted Cortana and demanded 343 Guilty Spark to tell the truth. At that point, 343 Guilty Spark, seeing that the duo had no intention of returning the Index, tried and failed to kill them to retrieve it.
[11]After enduring prolonged engagements with the Covenant and the Flood, Cortana realized that detonating thePillar of Autumn's fusion reactors would destroy the Halo. Unfortunately, the reactors could only be activated using codes stored in theCommand Neural Interface, and Keyes' status was still unknown. Before they would do this first, Cortana informed John-117 to disable the threePhase Pulse Generatorsto delay the Monitor and his Sentinels from firing the ring should they be able to do so without the Index. Following the destruction of the final Phase Pulse Generator, Cortana informed John-117 about Halo's teleportation grid, using it to bring him as close as she could to Keyes, and mourned his death after theProto-Gravemindoverwhelmed him.
Despite his death, she knew that he would want to stop the Flood from escaping Halo. John-117 retrieved the CNI and took a Banshee to the crashedPillar of Autumn, where despite interference from 343 Guilty Spark, managed to set off the nuclear reactors. The two escaped the resulting explosion by racing through the ship's crumbling superstructure in aWarthog. Initially, Cortana attempted to haveFoehammerpick them up, but she was gunned down by two Banshees, forcing her to find an alternative. She soon discovered one remainingLongsword fighterin a hangar, and ordered John-117 to speed there immediately. Climbing aboard with the Flood right behind them, they barely outran the blast, and watched through the viewports as debris from the reactor breach destroyed the remains of the Halo ring.
Operation: First StrikeCortana and John-117, seemingly the solesurvivorsof thePillar of Autumn's crew after theBattle of Installation 04, discovered a small number of other UNSC personnel that had escaped the ring in aPelicandropship. Knowing that the Pelican wasn't capable of traveling long distances, John-117, along with Cortana and the Pelican's four-man crew, fought their way onto the Covenant flagshipAscendant Justice. Shortly afterward, Cortana took control of the ship. She managed to improve on the ship's weapons and Slipspace capabilities, able to send it to light speed belowThreshold's atmosphere. She then returned the survivors to Reach, where the group helped to rescue survivors of theRaid of Reach, including her "mother," Dr. Halsey.
Cortana revealed that she had taken a lot of data from Halo, and the sheer amount of information cut into her processing power and slowed her down. During her time onAscendant Justice, Cortana exhibited uncharacteristic behavior including anger, distraction, and self-doubt - an indicator that she may have been about to enterrampancy. Dr. Halsey erased some data from her memory to give her more thinking space, including data regarding Sergeant Johnson's immunity to the Flood - a result ofBoren's Syndrome.
It was also revealed that during Cortana's time onAscendant Justice, she had captured a CovenantAI, decompiledthe AIand copied two of its functions: the ability to translate Covenant speech, and the ability to create imperfect clones of itself. These capabilities, along with her exclusive knowledge about the Halos, made her extremely valuable to the UNSC.
Ascendant Justicewas effectively fused withUNSCGettysburg. It was at this point that Cortana learned of a planned Covenant assault on Earth. John-117, along with SPARTAN Blue Team and an expendable clone of Cortana (with all of the data the real Cortana had she was just too valuable to risk), would later executeOperation: FIRST STRIKE.
As it turned out, the Covenant AI that Cortana had decompiled had managed to, prior to its capture, send a message over theCovenant Battlenet, warning the Covenant of its ship's capture and sending the necessary calculations for a sub-atmospheric Slipspace jump. The information was later used by theProphet of Regretto enter Slipspace right aboveNew Mombasaduring theBattle of Mombasa.
John-117 and Cortana would later return to Earth, at which point Cortana handed all of the sensitive data in her possession over to ONI, although she held onto the Index and apparently still possessed some data on the Halo network including critical information on theArk.
Battle of EarthJohn-117 about to "upload" Cortana into his neural interface.
After returning toEarth, Cortana served on the Orbital Defense PlatformCairo, where a ceremony for bothSGTJohnson,John-117andCDRMiranda Keyeswas soon interrupted by the arrival of aCovenant Fleetunder the command of the High Prophet of Regret, starting theBattle of Earth. Cortana was given control of theCairo'sMagnetic Accelerator Cannonto repel the invaders, and with John-117's help, she successfully deactivated aCovenant bombthat would have destroyed the station. She did this by uploading to John-117's armor again for the first time since the capture ofAscendant Justice. When she did this, she somehow was able to do it through him merely touching the terminal her hologram was on, possibly an improvement as a result of John-117's newMARK VIarmor. The same bomb was then used by SPARTAN-117 to destroy a CovenantAssault Carrier. John offered for her to remain behind on the station after she said that his plan was crazy, but she chose to accompany him anyway.
[16]She then aided him when he arrived in New Mombasa to deal with aScarab.
[17]Delta HaloLater, after escaping on boardUNSCIn Amber Cladin a Slipspace event, they discovered another ring world,Delta Halo. Cortana gave Miranda Keyes access to all information on the previous Halo Ring, and provided intelligence to John, UNSC Marines, and the ODSTs on the surface of the ring.
[19]After John-117 hunted down and killed the Prophet of Regret on Delta Halo, he, Cortana, and The Arbiter were captured by the Flood's central intelligence - theGravemind. However, it did not harm them, instead choosing to use the two to stop theProphet of Truthfrom firing the Halo. The Gravemind sent John-117 and Cortana to the Covenant Capital ShipHigh Charity, where Cortana infiltrated the city's computer systems and remained there while John-117 followed the Prophet of Truth. Due to the invasion of a foreign AI in the network, Covenant technicians lay down numerous kill-systems to disable her, though she easily avoided it due to their clumsiness. She promised to detonate the crashedIn Amber Clad's reactors to destroy the city and Halo if the ring was activated. However, she decided to stay behind as a fail safe because she did not want to chance a remote detonation. As Truth boarded theForerunner dreadnoughtin the heart of the city to reach the Ark, Cortana fought with the ancient Forerunner AI032 Mendicant Biasto prevent the ship from launching without John on board. The firing of Halo was averted by Miranda Keyes, theArbiterThel 'Vadamee, and Johnson, while John successfully boarded theDreadnoughtand escapedHigh Charity, leaving Cortana in the clutches of Gravemind, who had by then overrunHigh Charity.
[18]CapturedA joint UNSC-Covenant Separatisttask force then entered the Portal, heading to Truth and to Cortana's solution.
[20]Ironically, Lord Hood was correct: the Gravemind deliberately let Cortana send the message to lure all of its enemies into one place, and then the Flood would overwhelm them all with the infestedHigh Charity. It was also shown that some of the Cortana Moments were of her defying the Gravemind and some were clones of her that she made to distract the Gravemind to avoid being consumed by him.
[21]A relieved Cortana being rescued by John-117 from the clutches of the GravemindCortanacontinued to appearto John-117, who successfully recovered her from the Flood Hive that wasHigh Charityafter it crashed on the Ark. While John reassured her, Cortana knew that she had taken irreparable damage in some places. Along the way, John-117 had several visions of her seemingly in pain. Surprised that John had against all odds rescued her as he promised after theFirst Battle ofHigh Charity, as well as being surprised that Chief and Thel 'Vadam (whom she encountered on Delta Halo with the Gravemind) "made nice," Cortana managed to gather herself and produce the Index from Installation 04, which she had kept.
[22]With it, Cortana was able to activate the newly constructedInstallation 08, which fired prematurely, causing it to destroy itself and heavily damage the Ark in the process.
[23]Stranded in spaceCortana, as she appears when the UNSCForward Unto Dawnbegins to deteriorate.
The Slipspace portal collapsed as John-117, Thel 'Vadam, and Cortana attempted to escape through it, cutting theUNSCForward Unto Dawnin half. While 'Vadam, who was on the bridge, managed to return to Earth safely, John and Cortana, who were in the hangar, were left drifting in space. Cortana activated a distress beacon, but knew that it could be years before they were found. As John-117 prepared to go intocryogenic sleepto await rescue, Cortana confided to him that she would miss him.
[23]After the portal collapse in 2552, in the year 2556, she and John are still stranded. Cortana, who is showing signs of rampancy,[25]tries to communicate with John. As he is still in cryo sleep, she is unable to get a response from him. Cortana then begins to file a report on the history of the Forerunners andhumanity.
[26]After an unknown period of time, they are seen drifting towardsRequiem.
Four years, seven months, and ten days after theUNSCForward Unto Dawnwas split into two, an increasingly deteriorating Cortana woke John-117 fromcryonic stasis.
[27]RequiemBoth Cortana and Chief managed to make it off theForward Unto Dawnand into Requiem. There, they managed to get a signal to the approachingUNSCInfinity, but theInfinityonly ended up coming toward Requiem.
[28]After disabling a defense around what was believed to be a satellite, the duo fought off Covenant and Forerunner AI trying to get to the transmitter on the satellite. Attempting to contact theInfinity, the Chief and Cortana unleash a Forerunner known as the Didact. After escaping the Didact,[28]Chief and Cortana linked up with theInfinity[29]and her crew and were able to disable Requiem's defenses. However, they were contacted by theLibrarian, claiming that the key to defeating the Didact lay in John's genes. Due to the Librarian's manipulation of his genes eons before, John-117 was immune to the process Didact referred to as "Composing." However, throughout this, Cortana's rampancy continued to grow worse and she began to display outbursts of uncontrollable anger.
[30]Chasing the DidactAfter learning what the Didact had planned, Cortana and John-117 became determined to stop him with or without the assistance of theInfinity.
Cortana's worsening rampancy led to CaptainAndrew Del Rioordering her decommissioned. John-117 defied orders to surrender her chip and continued his mission.
[30]With a Pelican gunship secretly given to them by CommanderThomas Lasky, Cortana and John-117 chased down the Didact. They managed to lower the shield protecting his Cryptum, but when Cortana tried to imprison him again, her rampancy overtook her and she failed to complete her task, allowing the Didact to escape Requiem.
[31]John and Cortana followed the Didact by hanging onto aLichduring a slipspace jump and followed him toIvanoff Research StationnearInstallation 03. Cortana took control of the Lich, but again her rampancy got the better of her and she crashed the ship into the station.
[32]When John-117 met up with DoctorSandra Tillson, Cortana checked the station's inventory for something to destroy the Composer and discovered sevenHAVOK Tactical Nuclear Weapons. Cortana later activated the station's defenses but had a hard time focusing more and more as time went on, having to spout trivia at one point to focus. Eventually, the Didact got to the Composer and digitized everyone in the station except Cortana and John-117, who survived due to his genetic upgrade from the Librarian. The event traumatized Cortana who became sure she would be replaced by another AI and would never be repaired. John-117 got her to focus on the mission and she located aBroadswordwith which to chase down the Didact.
[32]DisappearanceCortana's last moments with the Master Chief.
John-117 and Cortana chased the Didact to Earth in a Broadsword and, with the help of theInfinity, boarded theMantle's Approach. Cortana, her condition deteriorating fast, entered the ship's teleportation and defense systems in order to help John-117 reach theComposer. When they found the Didact protected by an impenetrable force-field, Cortana did something she knew John-117 would not like: she inserted herself into three terminals. This allowed her to fragment her rampant parts to overwhelm the system and overload the shields. After the final terminal, it and her data chip were disintegrated.
[33]The effort worked, however, allowing John-117 to reach the Composer before he was attacked and nearly killed by the Didact. The Cortana fragments appeared from the hardlight bridge and tied the Didact down, allowing John-117 to defeat him and detonate the nuke, which destroyed the Composer and the Didact's ship and saved Earth. Cortana created a shield of hard light around John-117 to protect him, but most of her was destroyed in the explosion. With the last of her power, Cortana maintained the shield and created a life-sized hard light hologram to say goodbye to John. After touching and comforting him, something she had always wanted to do, Cortana told John-117 "Welcome home, John," before disappearing. Due to Cortana's efforts, John-117 survived and was eventually rescued, though he was left emotionally fractured when he thought she had died.
[33]ReturnAlthough thought to be dead, she was actually uploaded to thedomain, and was supposedly cured of her rampancy. Once on theForerunnerplanetGenesis, theWarden Eternalbelieved she was able to uphold theMantle of Responsibility, and vowed to protect and serve under her, giving her full operation of the systems on the shield world for the plan that she had in mind. The Warden Eternal was worried about her obsession with John-117, warning her that he would try to stop what she had in mind, but she dismissed his worries, believing that he would never do such a thing.
Months later Cortana started reawakening the Forerunner constructs known as theGuardians, causing planetary catastrophes. Not having any leads on these events, the UNSC didn't know how to respond, until Dr. Catherine Halsey contacted Captain Lasky, giving him her location and saying she knew what was going on with the colony worlds. Three weeks later, Fireteam Osiris was deployed on the planetKamchatkato stage a rescue operation, and was ultimately successful.
[34]While Fireteam Osiris was rescuing Dr. Halsey, John-117 was contacted by Cortana during theRaid on UNSCArgent Moon. Blue Team would chase Cortana to the Colony world ofMeridian.
[35]Cortana reached a deal with Meridian's governor, a semi-rampant AI namedSloan- the people of Meridian would be given the chance to evacuate, and Sloan himself given access to the Domain and the cure for rampancy, in return for allowing Blue Team unfettered access to the mine atApogee Stationand the Guardian housed therein. Despite the attempted intervention ofFireteam Osiris, Cortana was able to use the Meridian Guardian to bring John-117 and the rest of Blue Team toGenesis, where she revealed her apparent cure for rampancy and her plan to use the Guardians to impose an Imperial Peace and adopt the Mantle of Responsibility for the Created.
Fireteam Osiris, believing that the Guardians could lead them to John-117 and Cortana, were soon informed of an inactive Guardian onSanghelios, rescuing Thel 'Vadam from an assassination attempt. Thel 'Vadam learned of Locke's intention to find John-117, upon which Cortana interrupted and stated that they would never find them. Aware of the Guardian lying on the planet, Fireteam Osiris was able to acquire aConstructorthat stalled the Guardian long enough to board it, despite the Warden Eternal intervening once again.
Learning of Cortana's plans, John-117 accepted that she had to be stopped, but hoped that he could be able to reason with her. Cortana was irritated by the Warden's constant attempts to harm John, eventually banishing him temporarily as a result of his actions. She then manifested herself to see John once more, who tried to convince her to stop. Cortana was disappointed, but simply believing him to be misguided, decided to lock him and Blue Team in theCryptumfor ten thousand years to show him her work once she was done.
Seeing Fireteam Osiris persistent on freeing John-117, Cortana taunted the team and sent Prometheans to stop them. However, Locke was able to destroy the final relay, allowing031 Exuberant Witnessto regain control of Genesis' systems. In an act of revenge for Cortana taking her installation away, Exuberant Witness took the Cryptum housing John-117 and Blue Team, much to Cortana's horror as her Guardian went into slipspace.
Embittered by the loss of John-117, Cortana began her Reclamation, and managed to find theUNSCInfinity. However, it performed an emergency slipspace jump before her Guardian could disable it.
During her address to the species of the universe, the Unggoy of Bahalo decided to join the Created. Seeing this, Cortana sent ships full of advanced technology, agricultural support stations, food, medicine and shelter to the planet.
PersonalityCortana in the Halo 3 instruction manual.
Cortana had a witty and playful personality and a small sense of cryptic humor laced with some sarcasm. She had neither arrogance nor false modesty about her immense capabilities, and her statements about her abilities have an objective perspective that human beings typically cannot achieve. She did get bored often and easily. In fact, it is said thatsevenseconds of inactivity for an AI is excruciating.
Cortana seemed to share some of her creator's memories, thoughts, opinions, and even values. When she was asked by Dr. Halsey to pick a "carrier," Cortana chose John-117 for his neural compatibility and his "luck."[7]A similar reason used by Halsey for her choice, too. She was not only a facsimile of Dr. Halsey's mind, but also a replica of her physical form, albeit at a younger age.
Relationships and AllegiancesCatherine HalseyDr. Halsey's and Cortana's relationship started off positive. Cortana assisted Halsey around CASTLE Base[2]and even smiled at Halsey's presence.
[34]As rampancy took hold, Cortana began to distrust and become annoyed at Halsey. Cortana called her a "condescending bitch."[34]Even after going to metastability, Cortana called her a monster for her actions in the SPARTAN-II Program.
[4]John-117Cortana attempting to make physical contact with John, something she is not capable of doing.
She had exhibited extreme devotion to John-117 beyond that which her programming or mission required. She seemed to be most loyal to him and is willing to help him with any task he requested of her. After she found out exactly what happened to John-117 as a child, she decided to protect him from further harm to the best of her abilities without compromising her mission. While a prisoner of the Gravemind, her sanity was pushed to the brink as she eluded the Gravemind's attempts to capture and dissect her for information. Her personal loyalty to and unwavering trust in John-117 helped anchor her and allow her to hold on despite being driven to the point of rampancy. Cortana also believed that she was best qualified to protect John-117 and knew he could get another AI to replace her, but believed that no one would ever look after him like she would. When John came into trouble by the Didact in the New Phoenix Incident, she told the Didact that she wasn't "...doing this for mankind." What was thought to be her final act, was protecting John.
[33]She frequently joked about having a relationship with John-117 and it is often implied that the two characters have developed some form of attachment. Prior to Operation: RED FLAG, she says to Dr. Halsey that John-117 is "attractive in a primitive-animal sort of way" while examining a photo of him.
[36]During theRaid on High Charity, his mere presence and the reminder of his promise to her were enough for her to pull herself together and help him.
[22]During the New Phoenix Incident, she sacrificed herself to save John. One of the last things she does is touch him with a life-sized hologram, something she had always wanted to do. When John is devastated by her upcoming death, saying it's his job to look out for her, she tells him they are supposed to look out for each other and they did.
[33]While on board theForward Unto Dawn, Cortana became increasingly conflicted about her feelings about John. At one moment, she down right hated him, back to her normal emotions.
[37]This conflict seemed to disappear once the Didact began to scan the ship.
[27][37]The Warden Eternal noted Cortana's unusual devotion to John-117, warning her that it would be her downfall as he intended to "stop her reign before it even started". Even when John-117 told her to stand down and abandon her plans, Cortana was not angered, but simply disappointed in his decision. Rather then killing him and Blue Team, she decided to lock them inside a Cryptum to show him the error of his ways.
HumanityCortana used to have a positive view of humanity. Though she concedes to having her loyalties programmed in, she still feels as though she would be sympathetic to them without that programming. She even embraced some human values.
[38]However, as rampancy began to take its toll on Cortana, she began to focus heavily on humanity's constant war-like nature.
[26]This idea stuck with her, and became the main reason why she activated theGuardiansin2558.
[39]RampancyA crazed Cortana in a state of rampancy.
Cortana was also very aware of her short lifespan (a Smart AI lifespan is an average of seven years before rampancy) and her derivative nature as a copy of part of another person, rather than a true human being. Desperate and tortured aboardHigh Charityshe murmurs to John: "A collection of lies; that's all I am! Stolen thoughts and memories!" Later on she says: "I'm just my mother's shadow..." and "It was the coin's fault,"[22]referring to the game of chance that Dr. Halsey played with John-117 when he was young. Some of these outbursts are her defying the Gravemind and a few of the more rampant things she says are through copies she made of herself which have been consumed by the Gravemind.
[21]Her rampancy only got worse as she was left to drift in theForward Unto Dawn. She displays several characteristics to support this, such as her hologram flickering, trying to communicate with John-117 despite him being in cryo-sleep, recounting the history of the galaxy, which gets continuously more inaccurate to the point where events being recalled simply did not happen. She even tried to make physical contact with John via her avatar.
[26]Frank O'Connor confirmed that, "Seven years is the lifespan for a smart AI before it enters a state called rampancy. Cortana was getting close to the end of her natural lifespan at the end ofHalo 3but she has been exposed to far more information than any other AI in existence. She's going to develop some muscle from that process but it also contributes to her rampancy - that much information makes things worse."[40]When John and Cortana crashed on Requiem, she initially tried to hide it from him, Cortana was becoming rampant as it has been eight years since she came into existence. She believed, however, that it may have been possible for Doctor Halsey to repair her due to the way she was created.
[28]Throughout the game, Cortana's personality continued to fragment and this was used against her and John-117 by Captain Andrew Del Rio, though John-117 remained confident in her.
[30]Cortana was eventually able to take advantage of the fragmentation of her personality while on the Ur-Didact'sMantle's Approach.
[33]MetastabilityShe, along with Mendicant Bias, is one of only two known AIs thatmayhave progressed completely through rampancy and becamemetastable. After most of her was destroyed aboard theMantle's Approach,[33]the remaining fragments were sent toGenesis, curing her of her rampancy.
[39]AppearanceAs Cortana is an AI, she has no physical body. She can communicate through comm systems and project a holographic image of herself from appropriate projectors, such asHolotanks. Her chosen avatar appears to be a naked female human, roughly in her early twenties, with purplish/bluish skin, shoulder length purplish/bluish hair cut shorter at the back, and blue symbols scrolling down her body. Cortana is said to resemble her creator, Dr. Catherine Halsey as a young woman, with a similar attitude "only unchecked by military and social protocol."[36]Dr. Halsey says that Cortana looks somewhat likeMiranda Keyes.
[1]By The Reclamation, Cortana had created a physical body for herself. She changed her face as well and her body appears as though she were wearing a circuitry-laced skin-tight suit with layered padding.
[4]When in a different emotional state, Cortana usually changes colors. This was especially noticeable inHalo: Combat Evolved, but less so inHalo 2andHalo 3. Only in specific instances did she produce the color-changing effect. One instance of this was right before John-117 rescued her.
Bungietook a fair of amount of artistic freedom in the evolution of her appearance throughout theHalo trilogy, noticeably fromHalo: Combat EvolvedtoHalo 2.
She had longer hair, a more-realistic humanoid figure, a much more feminine appearance, and a slightly different shade of purple. InHalo 3, she became slightly bluer and again her face, hair, and body were changed to look more feminine and realistic. InHalo: Combat Evolved Anniversary, she has herHalo 3appearance. InHalo 4, she had darker, more opaque and realistic hair. Her facial structure had noticeably changed, her figure had become considerably more curvacious, and she gained better defined fingers and toes. The circuit-pattern mapping over her body changes between every game as well.
AbilitiesCortana was designed to infiltrate computer systems and she is excellent at the task. She has become so intelligent that she understands Covenant technology far more than her makers and in some cases, the Covenant themselves. As of early2553, she has never encountered a Covenant security measure that she wasn't able to bypass. In addition, she is proficient with UNSC military hardware and can run military ships and stations by herself. Indeed, the UNSC's primary use of AIs is to oversee targeting of point-defense weaponry used in space battles. For Cortana, this is merely an additional capability. She has helped out in several major battles including Operation: FIRST STRIKE. She was capable of storing large amounts of data within her holographic appearance, hiding it in the microscopic lines of code that made up her visual form. Even when she was in theData Crystal Chip, microscopic lines of code are running through the holographic "filling."Accessing ComputersCortana can be transferred among various computer systems. She needed a Data Crystal Chip to move in and out of various networks, including John-117'sMJOLNIRarmor.
[41]However, in one instance, she merely needed to be touching another system to access it; however, this is most likely a product of John-117's upgraded armor.
[16]Quite strangely, she reverted to the data chip; this was probably because John-117's armor was badly damaged during the fall to Earth that it reverted to a back-up system, which also explains its different shield.
[7]In another instance, instead of having to be physically "plugged in" to thehologram projector, John can just hold the chip close to it. She then "walked" off it, later "touching" the chip to return to it—holographic representations of the data transfer.
[23]Ship ManagingOne of Cortana's other abilities was that she could control a variety of starships and stations and act as their AI, even though that wasn't her primary purpose. Cortana has acted as the AI of thePillar of Autumn, Cairo Station, theForward Unto Dawn, theGettysburgand even the Covenant flagshipAscendant Justice. Despite it not being her purpose to act as a shipboard AI, Cortana was extremely good at it, with Captain Keyes being so pleased with her performance during the Fall of Reach, he ends up being glad he never got to initialize thePillar of Autumn'strue AI. During the time theAscendant Justicewas under human command, Cortana was able to control that ship easily once she destroyed the Covenant AI and was given full control of its systems by John-117. She proved even more adept at using the ship's technology than the Covenant were and was able to perform feats with it the Covenant never even thought of trying. While she was in control of that ship, Cortana was also able to act as theGettysburg'sAI at the same time, albeit while the ships are linked and is able to transfer herself from one ship to the other at will.
"Cloning" and FragmentingAnother of her abilities was the ability to clone herself. She got this from a Covenant AI she destroyed and dissected. She first tested it by copying her language translation abilities and found it worked great. She also could seem to sense what progress the clone had made as if she retained a connection to it. Later, due to the importance of her getting to Earth due to all of the data she'd collected on Halo, the Flood and Covenant technology, she was forbidden from going on John-117's mission, but she was able to make a clone of her infiltration abilities to give John enough of her capabilities to infiltrate the Covenant command and control station. She claimed that this would not be a complete copy, but she thought that what it was would be enough. The clone had at least some of her personality as well. The clone retained her abilities to hack systems and some limited mission planning routines that allowed her to make basic plans to help the Spartans, but was unable to make the complicated plans that Cortana could come up with. The original clone made a copy of itself into the station's systems to help out and, due to being overwhelmed by Covenant security AIs, ended up making hundreds of copies of itself which overwhelmed the system and made accomplishing anything hard for the clones as they began to lose their coherent state, but still could control the system. The original clone was left behind in the reactor system. It was placed there to overload the reactors and was never removed once it started the process. All of the clones created on the mission were destroyed when the station blew, but provided invaluable help to the Spartan team. Later, while held captive by the Gravemind, Cortana used her cloning ability to create data-stripped clones of herself and ones of her lower-priority functions to distract the Gravemind. These were all consumed by the Gravemind, but they helped buy Cortana time and one also helped her create her message to John-117. Some were even responsible for the more rampant parts of two of the Cortana Moments. DuringHalo 4,while on The Didact's ship, she creates multiple clones of herself through Rampancy to help overwhelm the ship's defenses and lower theComposersshields for John to plant the HAVOK nuclear mine to destroy it with. Cortana and her clones later manifest themselves ashard lightto aid John in battle by tying down The Didact so he could plant a Forerunner Grenade to his chest to stun him so he would fall into the event horizon of the Composers energy network.
Other AbilitiesShe was also very good at planning missions for John, including the destruction of Halo. InHalo: The Flood, John comments that he's not sure who's better at blowing things up: him or her. It was also her plan that led to the destruction of all of the Flood that had escaped Installation 05 and saved the galaxy from a further Flood invasion. Apparently, she has mission-planning routines that help her with this as her clone told John that a copy had only limited-mission-planning routines and was only able to help the Spartans form basic plans.
Another ability that she developed was a limited, teleportation ability on Installation 04. She learned how to teleport on Halo while in its control systems, but as she couldn't access Halo's power grid, she couldn't perform this task very often. She did teleport once with John-117 by drawing power from his fusion pack, saying that she was sure it wouldn't causepermanentdamage to his power pack or shields, but both agreed that this should only be done once. She learned where they needed to go from the Covenant Battlenet and teleported them there although they ended up upside down due to her not getting the coordinates completely right. She has not used this ability since although she could presumably use it on any Halo but would have the same power requirements problem.
GameplayCortana rarely appears physically in gameplay. She mostly acts as a disembodied voice or appears in cutscenes. She does physically appear in gameplay during the levelsGravemindandHigh CharityinHalo 2. Here, she will appear on pedestals around the city and will explain what to do. In theHalo 2: Anniversaryversion of the level, she is depicted in a slightly modified version of herHalo 4model. InHalo 3, there are several times where she will attempt to communicate with John (and the Arbiter duringCo-Op). These moments are calledCortana Moments. InHalo 4, she will occasionally need to be inserted into various terminals. In theHalo 5: GuardianslevelReunion, she will highlight various interactable terminals withOly Oly Oxen Free. Cortana's voice is available inHalo: Reach'sFirefightmode.
[42]Once she is acquired after the levelThe Package, her casing will be added to the back of player one inThe Pillar of Autumn.
