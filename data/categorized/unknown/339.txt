However, during the battle, the Covenant and the Prometheans allied themselves against the UNSC.
ContentsBackgroundAfter theBattle of Installation 00, the rear half of thefrigateForward Unto Dawnwas lost in uncharted space withJohn-117andCortanaon board. TheSpartanplaced himself in cryo-sleep while Cortana sent out a distress beacon.
[2]The ship drifted for over four years before it reached aForerunnerShield World.
[3]Surrounding the installation was a massiveCovenantfleet that had been outside the planet for almost three years. The wreckage of the Forward Unto Dawn was picked up on the fleet's sensors and at the command ofFleetmasterJul 'Mdama, boarding parties intercepted it.
[4]BattleClearing the DawnMeanwhile, Cortana woke John-117 from cryo-sleep and the pair began fighting their way to the ship's airlocks, with the intent of activating the ship's hull defenses. Emerging on the hull they found that the missile silo was blocked and had to be manually activated. After clearing the deck of several Covenant Remnant boarding parties, the Spartan activated the silo, destroying aCRS-class light cruiser. While still on the hull, the planet appeared to scan John-117 and then opened a large portal on the planet's surface, dragging the remains of the Forward Unto Dawn and the majority of the Covenant fleet, at least several more cruisers, into the planet's gravity well. Debris from theDawnstruck a secondCRS-class light cruiser, causing catastrophic damage and destroying it.
[3]First HoursTheMaster Chiefwoke within the wreckage ofUNSCForward Unto Dawnon the interior surface of the planet, surrounded by debris from destroyed ships and dead or dyingCovenant. After learning thatCortana'sconditionhad seriously deteriorated, the Spartan set out across the planet's interior surface. He came up with a plan to capture aCovenant landing pad, commandeer one of the surviving cruisers, and escape the planet. The Covenant fleet had already begun landing troops across the surface however.
Phantomsdeployed infantry,Ghosts, andShades. Covenant infantry began fortifying positions and entering Forerunner structures. Fierce firefights began occurring asSentinelsattempted to resist these incursions. As John-117 and Cortana fought their way through the Covenant army, Cortana picked up a phantom signal, piquing her interest. Eventually they arrived at aForerunnerstructure, within which was a localCartographerthat identified the planet asRequiem. The Cartographer also revealed that the signal was coming from the core of the planet, causing John to suspect this was where the Covenant were landing troops from.
[5]After retrieving Cortana from the Cartographer he set off again, fighting through increasingly heavy Covenant resistance until reaching another Forerunner terminal in a complex called the Cathedral. This terminal showed that the phantom signal was actuallyhumanin origin, coming fromUNSCInfinity. At that moment, dozens ofPromethean AIsappeared, surrounding them. Just as the Prometheans started to become hostile, Cortana succeeded in opening aportaland the pair escaped.
[5]Battle of HavenTheMaster ChiefengagesPromethean Knightswithin Haven.
John-117 and Cortana emerged on the interior surface ofRequiem's core. The pair quickly began encountering hostilePrometheans. The conflict escalated further as threeCRS-class light cruisers emerged fromSlipspaceinside the core and immediately deployed Phantoms, Ghosts,Orbital Insertion Pods, and infantry. Covenant forces quickly engaged the Prometheans in a fierce battle. After crossing the rocky terrain and fighting through both sides, the pair reached a vantage point from which they could observe the core of the planet. The pair discovered that while it was the source ofUNSCInfinity's signal, the ship was not there. What was there was a relay structure that was transmitting and amplifying the ship's signal. Hoping to use the relay to contact the ship, the Spartan then disabled two facilities on opposite poles of Haven that were jamming the relay's signal.
Cortanathen usedRequiem'sportal systemto teleport them directly into the relay structure.
[6]Didact's ReturnTheDidactupon his awakening.
The pair arrived at the structure in the midst of an intense battle betweenSangheiliandPrometheans. After clearing an area around what he believed to be the relay, theMaster Chiefattempted to send a message toUNSCInfinity, warning them not to approach theplanet'sgravity well. However he instead unwittingly activated aCryptum, waking its inhabitant, a livingForerunnercalled theDidact. With a wave of his hand he converted all of the presentPrometheans'allegiances, changing the hue of their hard-light from blue to orange. The Covenant soldiers present also swore allegiance to the Didact. He then ensnared John-117 using the advanced telekinetic capabilities of hisCombat Skin. The Didact expressed his disgust of humanity, and his belief that their inability to master theSangheiliand other Covenant races, whom he referred to as "primitives," meant that humanity had not yet earned theMantle of Responsibility. He then threw John against the wall, stunning him, before returning to hisCryptumand making aSlipspacejump. The Didact's escape caused the core to begin collapsing in on itself. John stole aGhostand, at the cost of theMJOLNIR'sshieldsCortana was able to give the vehicle extra boost. Just as the core was about to fully implode, Cortana used the collapsingportal systemand they escaped as Haven collapsed.
[6]InfinityPelicansreturn toUNSCInfinityas the ship re-engages its engines and takes off.
TheMaster ChiefandCortanaemerged at the opposite end of the portal back on the interior surface ofRequiem. Unbeknownst to them,Infinityhad picked up their distress call fromForward Unto Dawn, but not their warning signal from the relay. The duo appeared back inRequiemjust in time to seeInfinityfall from the sky, itsshieldsand engines down. Right on its tail appeared theDidact'sCryptum, which followed it to its crash site. The Spartan began traveling through thick jungles in pursuit.
[7]Meanwhile,Infinity's position was severely compromised. Its captain,Andrew Del Rio, deployedSpartanandMarinefireteams into the swampy undergrowth surrounding the crash site, in an attempt to secure a perimeter. These fireteams quickly incurred heavy casualties upon encountering thePromethean AIsand became cut off fromInfinity. The fireteams tasked with defending the ship'sdeployment elevatorswere quickly overwhelmed. On the ship itself, Phantoms swarmed past the disabled defense turrets and deployed kill teams directly ontoInfinity's hull. Captain Del Rio had believed he could give his fireteams air support and defend his ship simultaneously, howeverPhantomsandBansheesimmediately engaged all deployedPelicans.
[7]John arrived after fighting through heavy Promethean and Covenant forces and rendezvoused with an old acquaintance,Commander Thomas Laskyas well as aSpartan-IVfireteam under the command ofCommander Sarah Palmer. John then cleared an LZ for adropshipafter being given tactical command of Marine forces on the ground. After the wounded had been evacuated, the Spartans commandeeredheavyandlight armorfromInfinityand crushed enemy troops occupying the ship's primarydeployment elevator, only to be informed that Covenant kill teams were inside the ship, attempting to gain access to the bridge.
[7]Entering the ship via its deployment elevator, the Spartans were able to destroy all Covenant forces within the ship. However, Covenant forces were still being deployeden masseon the hull, and the ship's defenses had to be manually brought online. Using state-of-the-artmechanized infantry, John-117 was able to hold offPhantom dropshipsand re-engage theArcher MissileandMACturrets, which destroyed two nearby battlecruisers and drove theDidact'sCryptumaway; allowingInfinityto reactivate its engines and take to the sky.
[7]AssaultCaptain Del RiowatchesRequiem'sartificial sunset from the bridge ofUNSCInfinity.
After narrowly escaping its destruction,Infinitybegan moving back towards theplanet'sportal. However, a battery of fourForerunnerParticle Cannonsstood between the Infinity and freedom. The ship's shields were still down, meaning that ground forces would need to be deployed if the ship was to escape.
Laskytook point, in command of a jointSpartanandMarinedetachment calledGypsy Company. Accompanied by threePelicansand aMammothoutfitted with aMACand compliment ofWarthogs, Gypsy Company advanced towards the particle cannons.
[8]Two of the Pelicans accompanying Gypsy Company were destroyed by a shot from the first particle cannon. The third Pelican, carrying the targeting equipment necessary to direct the Infinity's fire, was also shot down by the blast. The Mammoth deployed Warthogs to secure the Pelican's crash site, allowing John-117 to obtain the dropship'starget designator. With it, Gypsy Company managed to destroy two particle cannons before encountering further trouble. ALichappeared and disabled the Mammoth's MAC, allowing Phantoms to deployheavy armorand Ghosts. John-117 managed to board the Lich and destroyed it, but the Mammoth had taken heavy damage. Captain Del Rio deployed two Spartan fireteams,CastleandShadowto the surface in an attempt to keep Covenant forces away from Gypsy Company.
[8]Finally, the Mammoth's route was too blocked off to continue and John-117 and Cortana carried on by foot. After fighting through a series of terraces and Forerunner walkways, the pair entered the facility which housed the particle cannons' targeting network. Cortana directed the remaining two particle cannons to fire upon each other. However, as soon as she destroyed the cannons, Cortana disappeared.
[8]The LibrarianWhen she did not reappear, theChiefheaded deeper into the facility, following several benevolentSentinelsthrough a series of corridors until he reached a large power source. John entered the power source, and it allowed him to communicate with thepreserved consciousnessof a greatForerunnerknown as theThe Librarian. She explained the story of theDidactand his war with theancient humans. She also warned the Spartan that the Didact intended to leaveRequiem, and obtain one of theForerunner'smost powerful weapons, theComposer. At this point she told him that althoughhumanity'sgeascontained an immunity to the Composer, placed there by herself over one hundred millennia ago, it needed to be unlocked, whereupon John experienced a genetic transformation and was teleported to a pedestal in another chamber of the facility. Cortana was there waiting for him, but so were severalPrometheans.
[8]Didact's EscapeAfter fighting past thePrometheans,Cortanaopened aportalandJohn-117emerged back above ground in the midst of a massive battle between two Gypsy CompanyScorpions, a Warthog, and aMongooseagainstCovenantarmor. Detecting the Master Chief on sensors,Sergeant Stackerdirected the Marines to support him. OverheadInfinitybattled several encroachingcruisers. Punching through the enemy armor and air support, the ground forces secured a vantage point from which John was able to use anothertarget designatorto mark the planet's gravity well, whichInfinitydestroyed. With the Covenant's air and ground forces almost completely annihilated from the area,Infinity's ground forces returned to the ship.
[8]Once aboard, John-117 and Cortana tried to pass on theLibrarian'swarning toCaptain Del Rio. The Captain, however, did not believe what he believed to be the "hallucinations of an aging Spartan," even thoughLaskyvouched for them. His stubbornness caused one of Cortana'srampantmatrices to lash out at the Captain, subsequently damaging the electronic equipment on the bridge. The Captain then insisted that Lasky remove her from the system for retiring. Lasky hesitated and John did so instead, refusing to hand Cortana over to the infuriated Captain. When the Captain ordered that John be arrested, the Spartan informed Lasky that he and Cortana would stay onRequiemand do what they could to stop theDidactwhile he should return toEarthand warnHIGHCOM.
[8]The pair then proceeded down to one of the ship's armories and deployment centers. Lasky met them and told them that he had been ordered to detain the Spartan and, just in case John-117 had already left, he had prepared aPelican gunshipfor "combat pursuit." Lasky then wished John good luck and left. Just beforeInfinityexited the planet, the Spartan flew the Pelican out of the deployment center towards theDidact'sCryptum. The Cryptum was sealed in a large shield and surrounded heavy Covenant air support including threecruisersandPhantom gunships. After fighting their way through the fleet and disabling three of the shielding pylons, Cortana prepared to crush the Cryptum with the remaining pylons, but was overcome with a fit of rampancy, causing her to drop the pylons. The second she did, amassive spacecraftformed around the Cryptum and left the planet. As the Covenant escort began to follow, John leaped off the final pylon and boarded a passingLich, which then followed the Didact's ship intoSlipspace.
