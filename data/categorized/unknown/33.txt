You and AIThroughout 2018, The Royal Society supported by DeepMind brought you the world's leading thinkers in AI, in order to help build a greater understanding of what machine learning and AI are, how the technology works, and the ways it may affect our lives.
The launch of You and AI followed the Royal Society’s in-depth assessment of public views ofmachine learningwhich found that just one in ten members of the UK public recognised the term "machine learning", even though the technology – a form of artificial intelligence (AI) – is already part of our everyday lives.
