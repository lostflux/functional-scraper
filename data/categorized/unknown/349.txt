It is also the third Haloinstallationto be discovered byHumanity. Installation 05 orbits the gas giantSubstancein theCoelest system, and was managed by itsMonitor,2401 Penitent Tangent.
ContentsSummaryThe purpose of Installation 05, along with its brethren, was to preclude and stop the parasite forms known as theFloodfrom consuming all sentient life in the galaxy. In the event of a Flood outbreak, one of the seven installations could be triggered to annihilate all sentient life within 25,000 light years. Once one ring is set off all remaining rings would activate. All seven rings could be fired at once if need be.
The climate of Installation 05 is similar to that of Installation 04, with varying weather conditions in different areas. Its terrain includes lakes and jungles, as well as the ice and snow-filledQuarantine Zone.
HistoryFlood OutbreakA Forerunner structure deep in Installation 05.
About 200 years prior to 2552, the Flood on Installation 05 escaped and evaded containment due to negligence on the part of the installation's Monitor, Penitent Tangent.
[3]The Flood quickly grew out of control around the area of the Installation's Library. The Flood were kept contained by aSentinel Wallbuilt around the Library, but2401 Penitent Tangentwas captured. Without it, theSentinelsof the Halo lacked a controlling intelligence and so many of the structures around Installation 05 fell into horrible conditions, and most of the Installation came to look like a jungle strewn with ruins.
At the time of the Human-Covenant War, a Gravemind was holding 2401 Penitent Tangent captive. Even with the addition of ForerunnerSentinel MajorsandEnforcers, the Flood were able to remain loose, albeit contained within theQuarantine Zoneby the Sentinel Wall. This stalemate is believed to be the cause of the slow decline into the horrible condition of the structures of the Installation. The Gravemind itself resided in the chamber directly below theIndexChamber in the center of the Library.

DiscoveryThe discovery of Installation 05.
In2552, theHigh Prophet of Regretdiscovered the location of Installation 05 during theBattle of Earth. He made aslipspacejump fromEarthto the Installation, followed closely byCommanderMiranda Keyes' shipUNSCIn Amber Clad.
After evaluating their situation, Miranda Keyes orderedJohn-117to capture and interrogate the Prophet of Regret about the Installation. After fighting the Covenant in various locations, John-117 and Cortana overheard Regret talking about activating the Installation which, according to the High Prophet, would start the "Great Journey." Keyes then ordered John-117 to locate and eliminate Regret, while she and her Marines aboard theIn Amber Cladproceed towards the Library of the Installation to retrieve the Index, both operations aimed to prevent the High Prophet from activating the Installation.
After fighting hordes of Covenant forces, John-117 finally located Regret in a huge temple over a crater lake. John-117 successfully eliminated the High Prophet and proceeded to be exfiltrated. However, at the same time, the Covenant's holy city, High Charity, arrived and sent a CovenantCCS-class battlecruiserto destroy the temple. John-117 escaped the destruction by jumping off into the crater lake, only to be captured by the Gravemind.
The BattleInstallation 05's firing sequence being cancelled.
After the Covenant had arrived, theProphet of Truthordered theArbiterThel 'Vadameeto go on the Installation's surface and retrieve thesacred iconto enable the start of the Great Journey. On the surface, the Arbiter was tasked by theJiralhanae Chieftain,Tartarus, to shut down the Sentinel Wall to allow Covenant forces to be deployed and assist the cause.
The Arbiter then proceeded beyond the Wall, only to be troubled with the Flood throughout his journey in the Quarantine Zone to the Installation's Library, and later assisted byRtas 'Vadumeeand his officers. In the Library, the Arbiter assaulted Commander Miranda Keyes and Sgt. Johnson. After neutralizing the pair, the Arbiter retrieved the Index but was later betrayed and cast into the depths of theIndex Chamberby Tartarus who acted under the orders of the High Prophets.
The Arbiter was then saved by the Gravemind from death and brought to a chamber where the Gravemind rests. Within the chamber, the Arbiter met John-117, the infected High Prophet of Regret, 2401 Penitent Tangent and the Gravemind. The five proceeded into the discussion of Halo's true purpose. Through the Installation'sTeleportation Grid, the Gravemind sent John-117 to High Charity, and the Arbiter to the Installation's Control Center, both of which to search for the Index and prevent it from activating theHalo Array. The Arbiter's presence sparked the start of theGreat Schism, a civil war which would soon split the Covenant into the Loyalist and the Separatist.
After navigating throughout the whole of High Charity, theIn Amber Cladmade a slipspace jump inside the Covenant holy city and crashed into one of the Covenant structures. It was apparent that the Flood had successfully penetrated the Covenant's defenses and managed to spread its infection throughout the whole city. Fighting his way through the Flood and Covenant forces, John-117 found himself unsuccessful in retrieving the Index. The Jiralhanae Chieftain Tartarus and the High Prophet of Truth, along with Miranda Keyes and Johnson held captive, left the site while leaving the High Prophet of Mercy being infected slowly by an Infection form. Cortana instructed John-117 to hunt down the Prophet of Truth while she begins the detonation ofIn Amber Clad'sengines to prevent the activation of Halo.
At the same time, the Arbiter managed to gather enough Sangheili and Unggoy support to engage the Jiralhanae and the Kig-yar. He met Rtas 'Vadum once again on a cliff overlooking the Control Center, with Tartarus arriving shortly at the entrance of the Control Center. The Arbiter, assisted by Rtas 'Vadum, rallied more Sangheili and Unggoy to support their operation to take over and commandeer a Scarab. The Arbiter 'rescued' Johnson from his captors and agreed to escort him in a Banshee to the Control Center. Johnson, piloting the Scarab, destroyed the entrance of the Control Center, allowing the Arbiter to enter the structure.
At the same time, John-117 was sent into the Forerunner Dreadnought to follow the Prophet of Truth by Cortana using the power conduit. Cortana left behind, faced Gravemind who had gained complete control over High Charity. Meanwhile, in space over the Installation, theDefense Fleet of High Charitycommanded by Sangheili and Jiralhanae shipmasters engaged one another as a result of the expanded Civil War of the Covenant.
[4]With the threat of the Flood escaping the Installation, both sides focused a small number of their ships to the burning of any ships trying to escape Halo.
The Arbiter delayed the activation of the Installation with the help of Johnson. Impatient and unsatisfied with the heresy told by the Arbiter, Tartarus enabled the firing sequence and engaged the Arbiter. The Arbiter successfully killed the Jiralhanae Chieftain with the support of Johnson and Miranda Keyes hastily pulled the Index out of its chamber. The firing sequence was put on standby mode, ready for remote activation throughthe Ark.
AftermathWhen Installation 05 was last seen, the Flood were seen having complete control overHigh Charityand several ships of the surrounding fleet,one of whichwould break through quarantine and eventually arrive atEarth. The Great Schism, a civil war between Covenant species, split the empire into Loyalist and Separatist factions. After the battle, the Sangheili fleet glassed the surface of Installation 05 to prevent any further escapes by the Flood.

[1][6]ArchitectureRuins on Installation 05.
The architecture of structures on Installation 05 follows the general Forerunner aesthetic (i.e. angular design, and same basic functional structures), but has a clearly distinct style from some other installations such asInstallation 00or04, an example being Installation 05's Control Room having similarity to Installation 04's Control Room in purpose, but with a different look, including a spherical shape at the center of the building. This is different from both versions of Installation 04, which look almost exactly the same (being of the same style) and have the same surroundings. In addition, many structures on Installation 05 including theTempleappear to be more weathered than those on other installations, having a slightly brown-tinted gray color.
A curious feature on Installation 05 is some of its ruins. While visibly consistent with Forerunner architecture, the ruins seem clearly older and more primitive than most Forerunner structures. They are also made of stone, as opposed to the metallic material seen on the majority of Forerunner constructs. This brings up the question of whether these are Forerunner structures at all, or if they were built by an even more ancient civilization or the Forerunners themselves long time before the construction of the Halo installations, and later moved to the ring for unknown reasons.
[8]Still, only a fraction of the installation's structures represent the older variety, as most of them are in a similar condition as on other known installations. It has also been suggested that some of the newer structures were built around the older ones to support and protect them.
[7]Forerunner stone ruins are not exclusive to Installation 05 however.
A complex of ruinsin an unknown location holds similar structures. Much like some of the ruins on Installation 05, this ruin complex is also surrounded by newer structures.
