Why TensorFlowTensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. It has a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries and community resources that lets researchers push the state-of-the-art in ML and developers easily build and deploy ML powered applications.
Easy model buildingBuild and train ML models easily using intuitive high-level APIs like Keras with eager execution, which makes for immediate model iteration and easy debugging.
Robust ML production anywhereEasily train and deploy models in the cloud, on-prem, in the browser, or on-device no matter what language you use.
Powerful experimentation for researchA simple and flexible architecture to take new ideas from concept to code, to state-of-the-art models, and to publication faster.
Solutions to common ML problemsSimple step-by-step walkthroughs to solve common ML problems with TensorFlow.
Train a neural network to classify images of clothing, like sneakers and shirts, in this fast-paced overview of a complete TensorFlow program.
Start with building and training a retrieval model to predict a set of movies that a user is likely to watch, and then use a ranking model to create recommendations.
Train a generative adversarial network to generate images of handwritten digits, using the Keras Subclassing API.
