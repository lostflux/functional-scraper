A new gel helped wounds heal and stay healed in a clinical trial.
Gene behind ALS hallmark discoveredStanford Medicine researchers have linked a specific gene known to be associated with ALS with a characteristic of the disease, opening avenues for a targeted therapy.
Sex differences in genes of mice brainsStanford scientists found more than 1,000 gene-activation differences between female and male mice’s brains, plus more than 600 between females in different stages of their reproductive cycle.
New possible ALS genes discoveredUsing machine learning, Stanford Medicine scientists and their colleagues have found hundreds of genes that could play a role in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
Fastest genome sequencingA research effort led by Stanford scientists set the first Guinness World Record for the fastest DNA sequencing technique, which was used to sequence a human genome in just 5 hours and 2 minutes.
Diversity key to cholesterol risk predictionA Stanford study shows that using genomes from a diverse pool of people improves the ability to predict an individual’s risk of having high cholesterol.
Pathology faculty net four NIH grantsEfforts to design a hepatitis C vaccine, understand the genetic causes of rare diseases, map genetic regulatory elements in organ systems and understand coronavirus immune responses garner over $40 million.
Grants for genome researchFive Stanford researchers will participate in a $180 million nationwide campaign by the National Institutes of Health to understand the effect of human-genome variations on health and disease.
Common genetic profile linked to drug reactionNew medications help many people with inflammatory conditions and may ease severe COVID-19, but they carry risks.
Statins could treat ulcerative colitisPeople with ulcerative colitis who are also taking statins have about a 50% decreased risk of colectomies and hospitalization, according to a Stanford Medicine study.
