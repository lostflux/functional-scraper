DE/ ENResearchScientists at ISTA conduct research in a wide range of fields.
ResearchInstitute of Science and Technology Austria (ISTA) is a cross-disciplinary research institution that combines basic science research with graduate education. Our scientists perform theoretical and experimental research inMathematical and Physical Sciences,Life Sciences, andInformation and System Sciences. They are organized in small to medium-size research groups that interact with each other across the boundaries of traditional disciplines. Each research group of ISTA is headed by a tenured or tenure-track professor. Below you can find a list of all our professors leading laboratories at ISTA.
