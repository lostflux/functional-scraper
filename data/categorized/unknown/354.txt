He is the most prominentSangheilishown throughout those games.
ContentsBiographyEarly lifeA young Thel training.
Thel was born Thel 'Vadam to theVadamfamily, rulers of the powerful State of Vadam on Sanghelios. As a young Sangheili, Thel was trained in the ways of the warrior by his relativeLak 'Vadamee.
[6]He joined the Covenant military, earning him the right to use the "-ee" suffix, which is added to a Sangheilian name upon joining the military. Thel fought alongside the Covenant when they attackedMadrigalin2528.
[7]Soon, Thel gained the rank of Shipmaster and earned the title of Kaidon within his keep.
[8]After being promoted toShipmaster, Thel suffered an injury in the training ring due to a mistake. His family hushed up the incident, as well as the resultant visit by a doctor, due to Sangheili culture equating the loss of blood and medical operation by a doctor with a loss of honor. During his convalescence, Thel made an old-fashioneddoarmir-fur Shipmaster's cloak, wearing it always to remind him that he could make grave mistakes if he let his guard down.
[9]Life as an Elite Zealot soldierThel's life as Kaidon was important for the Vadam family, as he was tasked with continuing the reign of the powerful State of Vadam. Early in his rule, he was attacked by three Sangheili assassins wielding Energy Swords. He managed to kill all three without even being scratched, but bluffed that he left one alive in order to determine who ordered the attack. He then killed one of the Vadam elders,Koida, for ordering the failed assassination, and ordered all of his line to leave the keep by sunrise or they would otherwise face execution.
[11]Thel was sent toCharybdis IXwith command overRetribution's Thunderto participate in theBattle of Charybdis IX, whilst being overseen by theHigh Prophet of Regret. He and several other Sangheili boarded theUNSCDo You Feel Lucky?and attempted to get to the vessel's navigation database, but it had been purged before they were even aboard. He left and witnessed the destruction of the ship before being called to theInfinite Sacrifice, where he met Regret in person. He was told of the humans wielding modified Covenant weapons, and that this was most likely theKig-Yar's doing. He was then sent to the23 Libraesystem to track down the source of the weapon traders, along with the Kig-Yar vessel,A Psalm Every Day.
[12]As he arrived at 23 Librae, his ship came under attack, first by Jiralhanae and Kig-Yar forces atThe Rubble, then boarded byA Psalm Every Day's forces. He ordered the destruction ofThe Retribution's Thunder, which killed all the boarding Kig-Yar. Thel, however, survived and was captured by Kig-Yar forces, along with most of the bridge crew. He and the bridge crew managed to escape and hijack a Kig-Yar shuttle, taking them to another Kig-Yar vessel. They went to the surface ofMetisetteand captured the leader of the Kig-Yar,Reth.
[13]'Vadamee fighting Spartan Jai.
After managing to escape Reth's clandestineUnggoyarmy, Thel returned to the Kig-Yar vessel, where they locked up Reth. Interrogating him, the Sangheili were surprised by Reth's insistence that he was allying with the humans with the blessing of theHigh Prophet of Truth, who sought to use the humans as a means to find their homeworld. He eventually escaped when a nervous Grunt still loyal to him, switched off the energy barrier, and fled into an escape pod. Thel then turned his eyes to The Rubble, as a large skirmish between UNSCforcesand Kig-Yar forces was taking place on theInfinite Spoils. He and his crew then boarded theInfinite Spoilsand came face to face withJai-006before fighting with him. The SPARTAN tackled Thel, disarmed him of his Energy Sword, and proceeded to draw a combat knife. The two warriors eyed each other for a brief moment before the SPARTAN, realizing that the marine he came to rescue was already dead, left the ship with the other UNSC forces. Thel and his crew, shocked by what they had witnessed, stayed and commandeered theInfinite Spoils.
[14]Thel managed to destroy most ofThe Rubble'sMass drivers, but then was helpless whenThe Redoubtwas destroyed and theExodus Projectleft the system. He decided the best thing to do was to wait for theHigh San'ShyuumofTruthandRegretto arrive and report to them with his comrade,Zhar. Upon reporting the failure of the mission, Zhar attempted to slaughter the San'Shyuum — believing them to be ordering his execution — but Thel activated his own Energy Sword and killed his former friend. This act prompted Truth to spare his life and give him command over a ship in theFleet of Particular Justice,[15]a newly assembled fleet for theCovenant Navy.
[6]Life as Supreme CommanderThel 'Vadamee in his Supreme Commander cloak.
At some point between 2535 and 2552, Thel's exceptional leadership and combat prowess earned him the rank of the Fleet of Particular Justice'sSupreme Commander. During his time as a Supreme Commander, Thel was responsible for over 1 billion human casualties, the loss of at least 7 human worlds, the destruction of over 123 human vessels during fleet action and the deaths of over 23,000UNSCpersonnel.
[16]Thel on trial in High Charity.
Near the end of his time serving as Supreme Commander, he led the victorious Covenant forces at theFall of Reach. As the battle ended, Thel ordered all ships within his command to follow the fleeingUNSCPillar of Autumn. Following theAutumn's course led them toInstallation 04. Commanding theSeeker of Truth, he had his ships begin evacuation of the ring upon the release of theFlood, but the parasite managed to capture ashipand infect a Minor Prophet, theMinister of Etiology. The sudden widespread evacuation led to confusion as ships became infested, and he was unable to prevent the destruction of the ring and was forced to abandon it. The abandonment saved his life, but also resulted in the capture of the newly arrived flagship, theAscendant Justice, byJohn-117, and he was called before the High Council to answer for these failures.
Fall from grace and becoming the ArbiterThel receiving the Mark of Shame.
The loss of theForerunnerrelicthat the Covenant held "holy" rendered the Council unmoved by his defense, and 'Vadamee was stripped of his rank, title, name, honor, and branded a heretic for his failure in safeguarding Halo.
[17]TheMark of Shamewas branded upon his chest in front of many of the Covenant,[18]and he was sentenced to death. He was sentenced to "be hung by his entrails" and his corpse "paraded throughthe city" as an example to others.
[19]TheProphet of Objectionwent so far as to say "it was heresy."[17]'Vadamee about to receive the Arbiter's armor, with the Prophets nearby.
Upon being brought to the Prophet Hierarchs of Truth andMercy, they intervened and offered to commute the sentence if he would become the newArbiter. Understanding that becoming the Arbiter of the Covenant amounted to an indirect death sentence, but also seeking an opportunity to redeem his name to retain honor for his continuing bloodline, the Sangheili accepted the offer.
[19]Gas Mine'Vadamee donning the Arbiter helmet for the first time.
'Vadamee's first combat assignment as the Arbiter was to stop theHereticuprising based in a ForerunnerGas Minein the atmosphere ofThreshold. The San'Shyuum had expected that he would die in the mission and so this was part of his sentence. He was assisted byRtas 'Vadumee,Special Operations Sangheili, andSpecial Operations Unggoy. The operation was even more complicated by the unexpected escape of the Flood from the facility. During the chaos that followed, the Heretic leaderSesa 'Refumeesealed himself in a protected zone of the station, to protect himself from the storm. The Arbiter drove the Heretics out by cutting the cables from which the facility hung from a larger structure, causing the gas mine to fall. After he had severed the cables, he chased the heretic leader in a Banshee to another part of the station. After crashing his Banshee, the Arbiter fought his way through massive amounts of Flood and a few surviving Heretics toward the station's hangar. Before Sesa 'Refumee could escape in aSeraph, the Arbiter assassinated him, but not before the Heretic Leader revealed the source of his heresy. The Arbiter was shocked to discover that the Heretics had been aided by theMonitor343 Guilty Spark, a holy Oracle in the Covenant religion.
With the uprising suppressed, theJiralhanae ChieftainTartarusextracted the Arbiter and used theFist of Ruktto capture the Oracle. His actions, which involved throwing the Oracle into thePhantomrecklessly, angered the Arbiter enough for him to remind the Chieftain who he was dealing with. With Tartarus, he left the gas mine via Phantom, asHigh Charityand the fleet were leaving Threshold's system.
Battle of the Quarantine ZoneThel 'Vadamee during the Changing of the Guard.
The High Prophets, though surprised by the fact that 'Vadamee had escaped alive from the gas mine, were not ones to waste such an outstanding warrior, and thus, 'Vadamee was sent to the "Quarantine Zone" onInstallation 05to retrieve the"Sacred Icon", which was needed to activate Delta Halo. Before the mission, Thel 'Vadamee witnessed thereplacementof theSangheili Honor GuardswithJiralhanae Honor Guards. Though distressed by change, and voicing his concerns politely to the Prophet of Truth, 'Vadamee made no further comment. Fighting his way through theSentinel Wall(with a few surviving Unggoy and Kig-Yar) to deactivate theLibrary'sshield, he made his way on foot to the Library, aided by the Spec Ops forces of Rtas 'Vadumee. Eventually reaching a gondola, he and the commandos made their way to the library with relative ease, though they were forced to relentlessly fend off Flood, controlled-armor resistance, and Forerunner constructs. The commandos chose not to accompany 'Vadamee to the "Icon," instead protecting their gondola, believing it to be their only way of escape despite the fact that Tartarus' Phantom was still present at the time.
The Arbiter proceeded into the Library, encountering the remains from a battle betweenUNSC Marines,SentinelsandFlood Combat Form, and witnessedLieutenant CommanderMiranda KeyesandSergeant Johnsonretrieving the Index. Using his armor's Active camouflage, he approached Johnson and Keyes. Attacking while cloaked, 'Vadamee surprised Johnson, knocking him unconscious with a headbutt. Keyes, reacting quickly, opened fire on 'Vadamee with her SMG's, dropping his shields and hitting him in the side, but the Arbiter soon disarmed Keyes as well, before Tartarus and his Jiralhanae joined the fight. After the initial scrape, Tartarus captured Keyes by using the Fist of Rukt's gravity manipulation to levitate her body and render her helpless, and claimed the Index for himself. A smug Tartarus informed the wounded Arbiter about the Jiralhanae' intended genocide of the Sangheili, and that those orders came directly from the High Prophets. A shocked 'Vadamee realized that he had been betrayed seconds before he was blasted into a massive shaft leading to the depths of Installation 05 with a shockwave from the Fist of Rukt.
Control room of Installation 05Instead of being killed by the fall, as expected by Tartarus, the Arbiter was captured in mid-air by theGravemind, the central intelligence of the Flood, and brought to its underground lair. It was here that the Arbiter met John-117, who had also been captured/saved by the Gravemind. The Gravemind tried to convince 'Vadamee that the Halos were weapons of destruction, not transcendence, which John-117 supported, saying the High Prophets were "making a big mistake." Though 'Vadamee was still in doubt, he was slowly beginning to believe as a result of Tartarus' backstabbing. In order to "show the truth" to 'Vadamee, the Gravemind teleported him to the Control Room, while the Chief was sent to High Charity in order to stop the Index from activating Halo.
Discovering the consequences of the San'Shyuum' betrayal of the Sangheili and the slaughtering of his species by the Jiralhanae, the Arbiter joined forces with a band of Special Operations Commandos, Minors, Majors, and a Zealot, as well as a small number of Unggoy, to raze a Jiralhanae encampment. Eventually, he met Rtas 'Vadumee yet again, joining forces to reach aScarab. Near the Scarab, the Arbiter and his forces managed to save a group of captured Sangheili Councilors, and a group of UNSC Marines, including Sergeant Johnson.
Johnson made a shaky truce with the Arbiter in order to prevent Tartarus from activating Halo. Given they shared a common enemy, they both agreed that Tartarus had to be stopped, with Johnson driving a captured Scarab and the Arbiter covering him from enemy Wraiths,Spectres, and Banshees from the air. After destroying many enemy units along the way, they successfully reached the Control Room of Installation 05.
Battle with TartarusVadamee fought several Jiralhanae Honor Guards before facing Tartarus, who was forcing Miranda Keyes to activate Installation 05. He was surprised to see the Arbiter still alive and there was a standoff between the two parties. The Arbiter asked343 Guilty Spark, who was also present, what Halo's true purpose was. The Monitor replied that the Halos were built "to destroy all sentient life in the galaxy" so that the Flood would die of starvation. In addition, the ones who built the rings, the Forerunners, died upon firing the rings as planned, contradicting the belief of their "transcendence." This convinced the Arbiter of the truth that he had been repeatedly told. It was from that moment that 'Vadamee's faith in the Great Journey had been shattered, his alliance with the humans absolute, and the treachery of the High Prophets fully realized.
With this revelation, the Arbiter tried to convince Tartarus to turn against the San'Shyuum. Tartarus, however, blinded by his fanatical belief in the Great Journey, as well as his hatred for the Sangheili, ultimately chose to side with the San'Shyuum. In the battle that followed, the Installation was activated and threatened to destroy all sentient life in the galaxy. The Arbiter, with the aid of Johnson and several Sangheili, slew Tartarus, allowing Miranda Keyes to stop the activation in time. The shutdown, however, activated a fail safe system; the rest of the Halos were set to standby mode, and could only be activated remotely fromInstallation 00. 'Vadamee then escaped the Flood-infested installation with the surviving Humans and Sangheili forces.
Meeting the Chief on EarthMaster Chief and Thel 'Vadam in the jungles of Kenya, Africa.
After Tartarus' defeat on Delta Halo, 'Vadamee officially changed his surname to "'Vadam," symbolizing his resignation from the Covenant; the rest of the Sangheili followed suit.
Upon arriving onEarthwith Johnson, 'Vadam and several of his allies discovered the Master Chief, who had just "arrived" on Earth as well. When the Master Chief regained consciousness from his long fall, he sensed and attempted to kill 'Vadam with Johnson'sM6 Series Magnum, but was stopped by Johnson, who explained to the Chief that the Arbiter and his kind have allied with Humanity. The Chief reluctantly backed down, although he at first did not trust Thel,[20]'Vadam assisted the Master Chief through the jungles nearMount Kilimanjaro, guiding him through the dense forest to thedam sitewhere they were extracted. He then aided the Chief and the other UNSC forces during the defense of a UNSC base,Crow's Nest, from Covenant Loyalist invaders.
Battle of VoiAfter leaving the Master Chief on the last departing flight from Crow's Nest before the base was leveled, Thel 'Vadam (known to his human allies only by his standing as the Arbiter) rejoined him at the docks, shortly after the Chief destroyed aScarabthat had landed in response to the destruction of twoAA Wraithsat the second lakebed. The Arbiter assisted the Chief and surviving UNSC forces in destroying a crucial anti-aircraft battery, aiding them as they fought through Covenant occupied warehouses, eventually helping them destroy the emplacement and opening a hole in the Covenant anti-air defenses to allow Lord Hood's naval forces to assault the Prophet of Truth'sForerunner dreadnought, which was docked and idle atopthe Artifact.
[21]The strike upon the Dreadnought did no visible damage. An enormous, fiery blue sphere was triggered over the activated Artifact, and formed a portal through which Truth and the Covenant fleet retreated. 'Vadam roared in fury at the loss of their quarry. But before Lord Hood could consolidate the scattered and confused human resistance, a Flood-infested Covenant cruiser, which had broken through the Sangheili's quarantine fleet around High Charity, transitioned out of Slipspace nearby, crashing into the city and infesting a significant area in and around Voi.
[21]The Arbiter and Chief proceeded to cauterize the local area of the Flood infestation, battling their way to the cruiser with the purpose of catastrophically overloading the crashed ship's engines to level the entire city before the parasitic infestation grew beyond control. They were aided by a handful of Marines who were not claimed by the Flood, and eventually Sangheili Special Operations shock troops, led by the recently promoted Ship Master Rtas 'Vadum, and a battle group under his command. 'Vadam learned of the fall ofHigh Charityfrom a Sangheili Major who was leading Spec-Ops soldiers to fight alongside the Chief. The Arbiter assisted the Chief in clearing a swath to the crashed cruiser, before standing outside with his fellow Sangheili to ensure no remaining Flood would attack John from behind. He managed to recover a holo-projector that contained a fragmented message ofCortana. 'Vadam, showing sympathy for the humans, convinced 'Vadum not to glass the entire planet, and thus the Ship Master only glassed infected parts of Africa.
[22]Battle of the Ark'Vadam with UNSC Marines andOrbital Drop Shock Trooperson theShadow of Intent.
After the UNSC and Separatist forces regrouped, they learned from Cortana's message that the Flood had taken control of High Charity and were on their way to Earth. However, she continued to say that the Gravemind was unaware of the Portal, and stated that on the other side is a solution to stop the Flood, without firing the remaining Halo rings. Because the Chief trusted Cortana, he and the Separatists dedicated all their forces to go through the Portal, arriving at the Ark. The Arbiter joined the Master Chief at the entrance of a localSilent Cartographerfacility to clear their way through the building to the Cartographer terminal. Once there, they learned Truth's perilous location, as well as an unfortunate defense he had conjured from the Ark itself. When the group was attacked after activating the Cartographer, the Arbiter joined the battle for the skies, instructing the Chief to follow 343 Guilty Spark to a location for extraction.
With the decimation of the Covenant Loyalist Fleet, Rtas 'Vadum's carrier positioned itself near the Ark'sCitadel- where Truth planned to remotely activate the rings - in preparation to deal a lethal blow to Truth's stronghold. Commander Keyes led a three-pronged assault, which the Arbiter and Chief participated in, on the shield generators to lower the barrier around Truth and the Citadel by deactivating the generator from a console in the tower's spire. After Sergeant Major Johnson failed to deactivate the third generator because of unexpected Jiralhanae resistance, the Arbiter landed his forces at the third tower along with the Chief to deactivate the final generator and shut down the barrier.
As Rtas 'Vadum maneuvered over the Citadel to glass Truth,High Charityexited Slipspace, crashing into the Ark. In its plummet to the surface, High Charity scattered a barrage of infection capsules which put 'Vadum's carrier out of commission and seeded the Ark with Flood. The Arbiter led his forces in conjunction with the Marines to clear the third tower of Flood, with the Chief's assistance. As a security measure, the Arbiter escorted a distressed 343 Guilty Spark to reconnoiter the damage inflicted to the Ark by the Flood, leaving his Sangheili with the Chief to push on to the Citadel.
Death of TruthThel 'Vadam "silencing" the Prophet of TruthAfter John destroyed two more Scarabs by the Covenant Loyalists, the Arbiter had finished his reconnaissance and was dropped off at the entrance of the tower where he and John raced to stop Truth from firing the rings. When it appeared that all hope would be lost, the Gravemind sent twoFlood Tank Formsto meet up with them and proposed an alliance to stop a common enemy. Both the Arbiter and Chief knew Gravemind could not be trusted, but reluctantly accepted.
Upon wiping the remaining Loyalists, the Arbiter confronted Truth as he was being infected by the Flood. He roared at the Gravemind, telling him that he this kill would be his, not the parasite's. When Truth attempted to proclaim that he would be a god, the Arbiter responded by stabbing him with his Energy Sword. The Gravemind then turned their attention to the pair, with the Arbiter stating that they had "traded one enemy" for another. The pair managed to escape through a ventilation shaft near the lift they had arrived in.
Destroying the FloodJohn-117 and Thel 'Vadam in Johnson's WarthogFighting their way back the way they had come, the two witnessed the construction ofInstallation 08, and planned to activate it. The Arbiter, Johnson and Rtas 'Vadum evacuated all UNSC and Separatist forces from the Ark. The Arbiter, worried about the Chief (who went to High Charity alone to rescue Cortana) arrived after the Master Chief at High Charity's crash site, and eventually found the Chief, who had already accomplished his objective. 'Vadam used aFlamethrowerto cover their escape as High Charity began to explode.
The two then escaped on aD77H-TCI PelicanfromHigh Charity, crashing it into the newly constructed Halo; after fighting through numerous Flood forms, they met up with Sergeant Major Johnson and 343 Guilty Spark at theControl Room. The Monitor turned on them after realizing that an immediate activation of the ring would destroy it and damage the Ark, as the ring was not yet complete. In the battle that followed, therampantMonitor killed Johnson and blasted the Arbiter out of the room; however, eventually 343 Guilty Spark was defeated by the Master Chief. Both Cortana and Thel expressed sorrow over Johnson's death. The Master Chief activated Halo and retrieved Cortana as the ring began to collapse. He and the Arbiter then retrieved Johnson'sWarthog, crossed newly-built Forerunner structures as they collapsed, all while being attacked by more Flood and the now-hostile Sentinels. They succeeded in reaching theForward Unto Dawnand escaped the Ark and Halo just in time. Upon entering the ship's cargo bay, it tilted and sent aM808B Main Battle Tankhurtling towards 'Vadam, nearly crushing him. 'Vadam ran into an alcove and narrowly dodged the tank. Before running to the bridge, he and the Chief (in a brief moment of camaraderie) exchanged nods; this was the last time 'Vadam saw the Chief. Soon after, Cortana activated the ship, as 'Vadam made it to the bridge and took control.
Return to EarthLord Hood and Thel 'Vadam shaking hands at theHillside Memorial- a sign of détente between the humans and the Sangheili.
The portal collapsed as theForward Unto Dawnwas transiting and the aft end of the ship, with John-117 and Cortana, was sheared off and failed to return to Earth. The bow section, containing 'Vadam, made it through and crashed into the sea, where he was rescued. 'Vadam was present at the dedication of the memorial to those lost during the war, on March 3,2553. After being thanked by Admiral LordTerrence Hoodfor "standing byhimto the end," saying "It's hard to believe he's dead," 'Vadam responded with "Were it so easy." This echoes his first line inHalo 3, symbolizing respect and similarity between aSpartanand the Arbiter, by how they are nearly impossible to kill. The Arbiter departed for Sanghelios aboard theShadow of Intentas the ship master, with Rtas 'Vadum and the rest of the Sangheili who fought at the Ark to see if it was safe.
[23]SangheliosDuring the aftermath of the Human-Covenant War, Thel 'Vadam continues to campaign with his fellow Sangheili for an indefinite peace with humanity. This has resulted in many Sangheili rallying in opposition, mainly theServants of the Abiding Truth, an old orthodox society who continue to deify the Forerunners. Shortly after a Jiralhanae uprising in the state ofOntom,Avu Med 'Telcam, leader of the Servants, decided that the time had come to attack 'Vadam and oust him from the mantle of Arbiter. 'Telcam's forces besieged those of the Arbiter at Vadam Keep, but were forced into a stalemate due to fewer keeps joining the uprising than the Servants had expected. However, when Thel 'Vadam permitted Kilo-Five to deploy onto Sanghelios to search forEvan Phillipsin the Temple of Abiding Truth, many Sangheili viewed this as sacrilege, joining 'Telcam's resistance. Thel 'Vadam's forces quickly began to lose ground to the Servants of Abiding Truth, they were quickly surrounded at Vadam Keep and outnumbered. As the Servants began assaulting the Keep, the battle was all but decided. In the final moments both sides were bewildered as a gargantuan human warship, theUNSCInfinity, made its debut and entered into position around Sanghelios. Admiral Hood personally offered to assist 'Vadam in the defense of his keep. While he wished to refuse such charity, he knew it would mean defeat, and thus he accepted. The UNSCInfinityproceeded to destroy one of 'Telcam's ships,Defender of Faith, and then utilized its Magnetic Accelerator Cannon batteries to destroy the resistance forces from orbit. 'Telcam escaped toNew Llanellidue to a rescue by Kilo-Five, and three of his four frigates escaped the Arbiter's cruisers, which were destroyed byUNSCPort Stanley, disguised as a Kig-Yar vessel. This was to balance the strength of the warring factions.
Battle on Ealen IVThel Saving Lydus from a Kig-Yar sniper.
Due to an escalation in Jiralhanae raiding parties against the Sangheili throughout joint-occupational zones and the deteriorating state of the overachingSangheili-Jiralhanae war, Thel 'Vadam accepted Lord Hood's request to have a peace conference onEalen IVwith a Jiralhanae Chieftain namedLydus, in order to gain access to the Jiralhanae resources. Upon meeting Lord Hood, Captain Lasky, Sarah Palmer, and two other Spartan Fireteams on the planet's surface, the three parties then engaged in the conference. During the conference, Thel appealed to Lydus' care for his own race, explaining that the Jiralhanae will eventually turn against each other once there are no other worlds to plunder.
The meeting was soon ambushed by the Covenant Remnant trying to stop the negotiations that were taking place. Surprised by the ambush, Lydus believed that he was deceived by Thel 'Vadam, but Thel quickly reassured him that the Covenant attacking them are not his own troops by saving Lydus' life from the sights of a Kig-Yar sniper. As more of Covenant Remnant troops begin to invade, the three conference parties began to make their way to a human shuttle, only to have it destroyed by Banshees. Commander Palmer shielded Thel with her body from the resulting explosion. With all communications blocked, and no way to contact Infinity for reinforcements, Lasky, Palmer, Lord Hood, the two Spartan Fireteams, and the delegates made their way to a parts depot and sealed themselves inside.
[24]Arbiter planning escape with Lord Hood And Thomas Lasky.
While all three factions were trapped in a plasma refinement facility, Thel 'Vadam worked out a plan with Lord Hood and Lasky as to how they were going to restore communications, and where they were going to find a more decent shelter. Thel attempted to include Lydus in the planning, only to be accused of working with the Covenant Remnant, an accusation that he quickly rebuffed. When Lasky found a suitable redoubt for the group to stay, he decided to break off from the group with SpartanNaiya Rayin order to find a way to restore communications.
As Thel, the remaining Spartans, Hood, and the Jiralhanae began to make their way to the redoubt, Palmer asked Thel if he thought the Covenant Remnant knew about their path through the underground to the redoubt. He responded that it was very likely. Upon hearing this, Palmer sent the Fireteams out to clear the way. Thel and Lydus insisted on taking part, claiming they were warriors first and diplomats second. However, Palmer convinced them both to leave the fighting to the Spartans, as they were both sent to the planet as peaceful ambassadors.
It was not long before the group was confronted by aLich. The Lich and its troops were quickly destroyed through the swift actions of Palmer. She ordered the Fireteam Jackknife to move onward to the redoubt, while Hood searched the dead enemies for information. Once the dead soldiers were properly inspected, the three factions continued their journey towards the enemy fortified redoubt. Along this route, Lydus demanded that Thel explain how the Jiralhanae can trust the Sangheili if Thel is not able to ensure a peaceful summit.
[25]Thel 'Vadam negotiating with Scruggs.
Inside the redoubt, Lydus was still unconvinced of Thel and Hood's concern for the Jiralhanae race, accusing both of playing kingmaker. During this conversation, the leader of Fireteam Jackknife,Vladimir Scruggs, flanked Hood and held him at gun point. As Palmer demanded to know what Scruggs was doing, Lydus began to threaten the traitourous Spartan. Holding out a hand to stop the Chieftan from charging, Thel asked Scruggs for his motives. Scruggs responded that the list is long and explained to Palmer that there are multiple levels of politics that have lead to this point. In particular he pointed out how strange it was that Thel had not been able to achieve stability within the Sangheili on his own over the past five years, hinting at some foul play within the politics.
In the midst of the explanation, Palmer shot Hood in the outer-thigh, causing the Admiral to drop and providing her the opening to attack and eliminate Scruggs. After Hood is bandaged, Thel assisted him on the walk down stairs to a small Covenant tug ship. The ambassadors and Palmer escaped on this ship, withDeMarcoand Fireteam Bailey giving their lives to provide anti-aircraft covering fire. Thel, Lydus, and Hood all parted ways, not having reached an agreement.
[26]Guardian AwakeningThel would eventually return to Sanghelios. Here he would be contacted by the UNSC for assistance in finding a Forerunner construct called aGuardian.
[27]Fireteam Osiriswould be sent to meet him. However, he was in the midst of a battle with the Covenant.
[28]Eventually he would meet with Jameson Locke, Commander Sarah Palmer, and Doctor Catherine Halsey.
[29]The Arbiter was initially angered to find that Locke was leading the UNSC Fireteam. During the Human-Covenant war, Locke had been a member ofONI, recommending they assassinate Thel, and had volunteered to carry out the mission. Thel refused to allow the SPARTANS to access Sunaion until his forces were ready to assault the floating city.
[29]Battle of SunaionHe would lead hisSwords of Sangheliosand Fireteam Osiris to fight the Covenant atSunaion. At Sunaion, he would finally claim his victory over the Covenant for the Swords of Sanghelios. Fireteam Osiris would depart on the Guardian buried there.
[30]Reunion with the Master ChiefArbiter Thel 'Vadam reunites with his Spartan friend, John-117, for the first time in years.
Thel would continue to stay on Sanghelios when The Reclamation began. Blue Team and Fireteam Osiris would return to him, Dr. Halsey, and Sarah Palmer.
[31]John-117 introduced Blue Team to Arbiter 'Vadum, who proceeded to invite his old friend and the new arrivals to join in a celebratory meal commemorating their victory over the last of Jul 'Mdama's Covenant. Following the meal, both teams departed to reach rendezvous with the UNSCInfnity.
[32]PersonalityThel, like all Sangheili, is keen to do things in an honorable manner, though he is more flexible when it comes to equipment, weapons, and vehicles. His hatred of theJiralhanaedoesn't seem to be as strong or destructive as that of otherSangheili; one example of this is when the Arbiter tried to reason withTartarusin Installation 05's Control Room. He is shown to be true to his title "Arbiter" as he often tries to negotiate with some of his other enemies (Yanme'e, for example) and will only kill when forced to do so. He has deep respect for his fellow Sangheili and a grudging respect for the humans, specifically John-117 and Sergeant Johnson.
Despite being a former enemy of humanity, Thel has shown a willingness to fight alongside them toward a common goal. Even before peace was established, Thel was willing to work with Avery Johnson to stop Tartarus. Johnson's aid in the fight with Tartarus and the fight he put against him earlier may have earned Vadam's respect as he seemed to respect Johnson in their later encounters. He also showed sorrow at Johnson's death, and said that even beyond death, the Sergeant still guided them. He was also willing to fight side by side and back to back with the Master Chief, someone he once considered a great enemy. Thel also respected humanity enough to be present at a memorial to everyone who fell in the war. While he respected the humans he was wary of their intent and likely had his own reason for having Evan Phillips visiting Sanghelios.
Although he often conducted himself with honor and a measure of tolerance towards others, he was not beyond pride and impatience, and would sometimes act dismissively or condescendingly to people like Catherine Halsey or Spartan Locke. Those who did not know him well frequently thought him stubborn and willful.
Combat'Vadam, commonly known as the Arbiter, stands withUsze 'Tahamand John-117.
Thel 'Vadam stands an intimidating seven feet and ten inches, and possesses huge fingers, as do all other Sangheili. Because of this, Thel struggles to put his hands around guns such as Magnums or Plasma Pistols (and due to his height, when sitting in a Pelican Dropship, he involuntarily takes up a lot of leg room). InHalo 2, numerous small graphical and gameplay differences exist between the Arbiter and the Master Chief. When playing as the Arbiter, the Chief's flashlight is replaced by an Active camouflage feature, exclusive toHalo 2; due to the antiquated armor of the Arbiter, the camouflage does not last forever—it lasts for ten seconds onEasyandNormaldifficulties, and five seconds onHeroicandLegendarydifficulties. The Arbiter bleeds purple blood instead of red, and hisHeads-up displayis sleeker. The Arbiter's HUD is also a purple color, rather than the Spartan blue; inHalo 3it is teal and is presented in a more curved fashion than Player One's. Player Three and Four's HUDs are also more curved as they too are Sangheili. InHalo 2, the sound his shield makes when it is depleted is different from that of the Master Chief's. InHalo 3, he still has Active camouflage, but it is only illustrated in the first cutscene of the game and to elude enemies—it cannot be used when playing as the Arbiter unless you pick up the Active camouflage. He has a flashlight on his left shoulder inHalo 3, which can be used by players inCooperative Play.
The Arbiter is very experienced at combat and has extensive knowledge of every weapon and vehicle. The Arbiter expressed a desire to understand human weapons even before his alliance with theUNSC.
[33]His most commonly used weapons are the Plasma Rifle, Energy Sword, and the Carbine.
[34]InHalo 3, the Arbiter is a very useful ally against the Flood when he has his Energy Sword out, but when fighting Covenant forces on his own on Heroic and Legendary, the NPC Arbiter tends to be knocked out frequently, for long periods of time, especially on Legendary. This is mostly due to his tendency to lead suicidal charges with his Energy Sword, despite the enemy's great distance from him. However, he is useful on Normal and Easy. If aMissile Podis given to him by the support weapon glitch or placing it near him while unconscious, the missiles he fires will track enemies.
