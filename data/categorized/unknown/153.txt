Why We’re HereArtificial Intelligence systems are being applied to many arenas of human life – across major sectors such as education, health care, criminal justice, housing, and employment – influencing significant decisions that impact individuals, populations, and national agendas.
But the vast majority of AI systems and related technologies are being put in place with minimal oversight, few accountability mechanisms, and little information about their broader implications. Those developing these systems are generally private companies, whose incentives do not always align with those of the populations on whom they are used, even as these systems are rapidly integrated into core social domains.
To ensure that all AI is sensitive and responsive to the people who bear the highest risk of bias, error, or exploitation, we will need to develop new ways to identify, understand, analyze, and ensure these systems –– and those developing and deploying them –– are accountable.
What We DoFounded in 2017, the AI Now Institute produces interdisciplinary research and public engagement on the social implications of artificial intelligence. We aim to:Currently, our research focuses on four key domains: rights and liberties, labor and automation, bias and inclusion, and safety and critical infrastructure.
PartnersAI Now’s work is done through collaborations across an expansive, world-class network that includes scholars, technologists, policy-makers, advocates, and many others. We have established formal partnerships with the following organizations:FundingHere we provide a detailed account of our funding. We felt that being honest about the texture and nature of our funding, its sources, and how it has changed over time was both modeling the kind of transparency we’d like to see more of in this space, and helping share the path that led us where we are today.
AI Now does not take funding from corporate donors, particularly tech companies whose practices and products our work is dedicated to examining. This is a change.
When AI Now began, both co-founders were directly employed by tech companies: Meredith Whittaker at Google, and Kate Crawford at Microsoft. Meredith’s group at Google had a significant budget under Meredith’s direction, much of which Meredith contributed to AI Now. This paid for the majority of the first and second AI Now annual symposia, and made up over half of the organization’s budget for the first years. With Meredith’s encouragement, Google’s DeepMind also contributed to AI Now during the Institute’s first year. This money was given to AI Now, via NYU, as a “gift,” meaning that its use was not accountable to Google. With Meredith’s ouster from Google, following sustained labor organizing in opposition to the company’s business and workplace practices, this funding ceased.
Kate Crawford left AI Now in 2020. While she was at the Institute, Microsoft covered her salary, and funded a workshop on Disability & AI and a happy hour organized by AI Now. Beyond this, Microsoft did not contribute to AI Now’s operational or research budget.
Our current funding comes from foundations, listed on this page. In many cases this funding is earmarked for specific projects, but does not shape nor dictate our research outcomes. We continue to be committed to unflinching and rigorous research into the social implications of artificial intelligence technologies and the institutions that develop and use them. We don’t allow our funders or the institutions with which we’re affiliated––past or present, corporate, foundation-based, or educational––to dictate our areas of research or influence our findings and recommendations. We believe our research outputs speak to this commitment.
Past SupportersResearch Independence & IntegrityThe AI Now Institute provides independent research on the social implications of artificial intelligence. We strongly support independent, peer-reviewed research and the intellectual freedom and integrity of our scholars.
