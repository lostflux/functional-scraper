We must use them with care and wisdom to ensure they benefit all.
But what are they?At Singularity, we dig deep into five key areas of exponential technology. Each area contains a portfolio of technologies that are nascent but gathering momentum and have the potential to make a step change from today. They may shift the economics of industries and have ethical implications that need to be addressed. Their pioneers will impact billions of lives.
