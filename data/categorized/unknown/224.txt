Building a robust system that can drive solely based on cameras allows us to pinpoint the critical safety segments for which we truly need redundancy from radars and lidars. This effort to avoid unnecessary over-engineering or “sensor overload” is key to keeping the cost low.
Advanced Driver Assistance SystemsBeyond the fact that ADAS is the core of life-saving technology, it allows us to validate the technological building blocks of autonomous vehicles through our numerous production programs with automakers that submit our technology to the most stringent safety testing. Our ADAS programs – more than 60 million vehicles on roads today – provide the financial “fuel” to sustain autonomous development activity for the long run.
MappingAutonomous vehicles will require many system redundancies to deal with unforeseen circumstances. A high-definition map is required for precise localization of the vehicle, relative to road boundaries and intersections, under all conditions. Mobileye's Road Experience Management (REM™), which uses crowd-sourcing, is a unique, low-cost solution for building and rapidly updating this HD map.
