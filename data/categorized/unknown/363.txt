ByLeila SlomanRead Later“Ribbon concordance” will let mathematicians compare knots by linking them across four-dimensional space.
fluid dynamicsMathematicians Coax Fluid Equations Into Nonphysical SolutionsByLeila SlomanRead LaterThe famed Navier-Stokes equations can lead to cases where more than one result is possible, but only in an extremely narrow set of situations.
number theoryNew Proof Illuminates the Hidden Structure of Common EquationsByLeila SlomanRead LaterVan der Waerden’s conjecture mystified mathematicians for 85 years. Its solution shows how polynomial roots relate to one another.
machine learningIn New Math Proofs, Artificial Intelligence Plays to WinByLeila SlomanRead LaterA new computer program fashioned after artificial intelligence systems like AlphaGo has solved several open problems in combinatorics and graph theory.
number theoryMathematicians Prove 30-Year-Old André-Oort ConjectureByLeila SlomanRead LaterA team of mathematicians has solved an important question about how solutions to polynomial equations relate to sophisticated geometric objects called Shimura varieties.
combinatoricsMathematician Answers Chess Problem About Attacking QueensByLeila SlomanRead LaterThen-queens problem is about finding how many different ways queens can be placed on a chessboard so that none attack each other. A mathematician has now all but solved it.
