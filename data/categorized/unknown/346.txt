There were two known additional factions of the conflict: theFloodand a small number of surviving Forerunner constructs. Both additional factions proved to be invaluable to the efforts of humanity, as the information taken fromForerunnerconstructs and the Flood invasion ofHigh Charitywere helpful insplitting the Covenant apartin October of2552.
The war was instigated by the Covenant, whoseProphetsdiscovered that humans were directly related to theForerunners. In order to keep the Covenant Empire intact, war was declared against humanity. Over the next few decades, the Covenant, with superior numbers and technology, overpowered humanity on many worlds, including heavily defended strongholds such asReach. Aside from several notable triumphs, the UNSC would only win scattered and costly victories, most of which the Spartan super-soldiers contributed to immensely.
The conflict was closely connected with, and the cause of, theCovenant Civil War, both of which resulted in the final defeat of the Covenant Loyalists andFlood. Thefinal battletook place on December 11,2552. The official end of war ceremony occurred on March 3,2553.
[4]The war was incredibly costly to both sides, with over twenty-three billion human casualties and enormous Covenant military losses, including the mobile homeworld of High Charity. The war ultimately lasted for a total of twenty-eight years.
ContentsBackgroundHumanityand the Covenant first came into direct contact on February 3,2525, when aKig-YarFrigate, theMinor Transgression, discovered a human ship that had dropped out of slipspace due to a problem with theShaw-Fujikawa Translight Engine. The Kig-Yar raided that ship and another one. The Harvest shipping operations AI, Sif, found out about the raids as a result of the distress beacon from the ships (although she and anundercover ONI spookon Harvest thought that Insurrectionists, not aliens, were behind the raids). The spook set a trap for the Kig-Yar which resulted in aminor skirmishbetweenStaff SergeantsNolan ByrneandAvery Johnsonand the Kig-Yar privateers. When the Covenant returned with another ship and a contingent of Jiralhanae, the UNSC proposed a meeting (via pictogram) to trade. The Covenant met the UNSC on Harvest, but were only interested in claiming the relics that theLuminaryhad detected on Harvest, completely oblivious that the humans were the "relics" in question. The meeting was botched afterOsmo, a member of theColonial Militia, was attacked by a nervousUnggoy, part of a second Covenant force sent to look for the relics. As a result, a firefight erupted between the two groups and the Covenant retreated back to their ship.
The Prophets declared Humanity to be an affront to their gods (later propaganda would declare humans had inhabited and "defiled" Forerunner artifacts and worlds), and called for a crusade against the Human species. The Covenant's final objective was nothing less than totalgenocide.
Unknown to all but the highest echelons of leadership, the campaign to exterminate Humanity was an attempt by the Prophets to maintain political and religious power. In truth, the Prophets had discovered Forerunner objects that the Luminary revealed on Harvest were actually Humans (which the Prophets interpreted as meaning that the Humans were descendants of the Forerunners, or possibly surviving Forerunners). Initially, the Covenant interpreted the glyph from the luminary as "Reclamation." The Forerunner AI032 Mendicant Biasrevealed that the interpretation was incorrect: the glyph meant "Reclaimer." The Prophets Regret and Truth realized that if the Humans were Forerunners, then it was possible to be left behind when the prophesied Great Journey occurred. This stood in direct contradiction to the Covenant religion. The Hierarchs, recognizing that this truth would destroy the Covenant, declared war on Humanity, hoping the truth would perish with their newly declared foe.
The WarEarly BattlesStaff Sergeant Johnson leading Colonial Militia during the Covenant invasion of Harvest.
The first battle of the war was the extended, albeit one-sided, ground battle which took place on Harvest. The UNSC managed to delay the Covenant long enough to evacuate many of Harvest's civilians. Eventually, the Covenant used their capital ships toglassthe planet's surface.
Cole's fleet destroys the Covenant ship in the Second Battle of Harvest.
The Covenant continued to attack and destroy Humans wherever they were found, using theirLuminariesto find Human worlds. Though the UNSC forces fought bravely, inferior technology made any victory difficult - dependent on strategic and numerical superiority, often with the aid of Spartans. Human armor, missiles, magnetic accelerator cannons, and crude slipspace technology were asymmetrically matched with Covenant energy shields, plasma torpedoes, energy projectors, and pinpoint slipspace jumps. The Covenant, fighting a war of extermination, did not need to commit to full ground invasions except in special circumstances. Covenant ships needed only to destroy human space-borne defenses, then reduce the planet's surface to glass with orbital plasma bombardments. Covenant troops were used to soften up UNSC ground forces, or hunt for holy relics. Over twenty-seven years, the Covenant whittled UNSC forces away through firepower and attrition.
Realizing the threat posed to humanity by the Covenant, the UNSC gaveVice AdmiralPreston Colethe command of the then-largest fleet in human history with orders to retake Harvest. Coleretook Harvestin2526, and then spent five years chasing the Covenant around theOuter Colonies, scoring victories atAlpha Aurigae,XI Bo√∂tis A, andGroombridge-1830. Meanwhile, the Covenant returned to Harvest, determined to recapture the planet. This led to a five-year longseries of engagementson Harvest between the Covenant and the UNSC.
The Apex and the Arbiter (2531)TheProphet of Regretconverses with the17th Arbiteron the destruction of the human race.
Despite their major numerical and technological advantages over humanity, by2531, the Covenant High Prophets had realized that the task of destroying an entire sapient species had a logistical burden beyond anything that theCovenant militarycould muster without leaving Covenant space defenseless.
[5]Despite the UNSC's disadvantages, the Prophets considered the UNSC's armed forces powerful enough to pose a threat to the Covenant. These concerns would be justified by extreme Covenant losses during the war's culmination in 2552. TheProphet of Regretdispatched anArbiterto Harvest to claim a Forerunnerartifactburied under the north pole of Harvest. Acquisition of advanced technology would allow a quick, decisive victory in the conflict.
Preston Cole counter-attacked by sending a force composed ofUNSCSpirit of FireandUNSCProphecyback to Harvest after receiving a message from anONIProwler. The battle resulted in victory for Cole, despite major casualties. Upon discovering that the Covenant, under the command of 'Moramee, had excavated Forerunner artifacts in the northern polar region,CaptainJames Cutterdeployed ground forces to remove the Covenant occupation.
[6]After a heated fight on the planet's surface, the UNSC forces were able to examine the artifact, a star map,[7]and realized in horror that information had led the Covenant to anotherUEGcolony:Arcadia.
[8]UNSCSpirit of Fireengages a CovenantCPV-class heavy destroyerin Shield 0459.
As predicted, the Covenantfollowed the informationfrom the artifact to Arcadia. The Covenant hoped that the planet would contain more Forerunner artifacts for them to claim, and while they only found acomplex of ruins, information garnered from them led them toShield 0459.
Spirit of Firefollowed and removed the Covenant presence from the planet. However, 'Moramee's capture of animportant civilian researcherforced Captain Cutter to pursue the Covenant without reinforcements.
On the Shield World, the crew ofSpirit of Fireeventually discovered that the Covenant needed Professor Anders, by definition a Reclaimer, to activatethe Apexand claim the huge fleet ofForerunner starshipswithin. A group of Marines, together with Spartan-IIRed Team, rescued the researcher and destroyed the Shield World. The Arbiter was also killed byJohn Forgeduring the battle, though the Prophet of Regret escaped.
Spartan-III (2531)Despite the well-publicized victory at Harvest, the UNSC was already on the way to losing the war. A number of colonies had already been glassed by the Covenant or abandoned, includingEridanus II,Dwarka, andChi Ceti IV. The UNSC's best hope for conventional victory lay with theSPARTAN-II Program, a program designed to create super-soldiers, originally to combatInsurrectionists. Despite their incredible combat ability, there were never enough Spartans to meet demand for wide scale deployment. Recognizing this, the Office of Naval Intelligence authorized the creation of theSPARTAN-III Program. The brainchild ofColonelJames Ackerson, these Spartans would be trained with a greater emphasis on stealth and teamwork, and would be sent on missions against high-priority targets with suicidal odds.
Crisis (2534-2535)A member of Gray Team at theBattle of the Rubble.
With the majority of the Outer Colonies glassed or abandoned, the UNSC faced an economic crisis. Some of their most importantAgricultural Worldshad been destroyed, leading to widespread food shortages. OnCharybdis IX, riots broke out. Meanwhile, Covenant forces began to encroach on theInner colonies. In response, the UNSC issuedUnited Nations Space Command Emergency Priority Order 098831A-1, "The Cole Protocol." No UNSC vessel could be permitted to lead the Covenant to Earth, or any other human population center. Furthermore, all movement through space was restricted toUNSC Navyvessels.
Insurrectionistattacks increased in the face of what they perceived as a removal of their right to freedom of movement. This was to culminate in the discovery of Insurrectionists using Covenant weapons modified for human use from seemingly renegade Kig-Yar. Shocked, the UNSC saw this as a major threat to security. The Covenant viewed it as heresy that humans would modify their weapons, and as a result theProphet of RegretdispatchedThel 'Vadameeto destroy the source of the modified weapons:The Rubble.
Fleeing from theBattle of Charybdis IX,UNSCMidsummer Nightchased an Insurrectionist freighter to the Rubble and discovered that the Insurrectionists there had actually formed an alliance with a colony ofKig-Yar. These Kig-Yar supplied the weapons, and the Insurrectionists modified them. The crew ofMidsummer Night, including its captain,LieutenantJacob Keyes, were captured, but later escaped and aided Spartan-IIGray Teamand the Rubble's citizens stop an assault from the Kig-Yar leader,Reth, and 'Vadamee's forces. It later transpired that theProphet of Truthhad ordered the Kig-Yar to ally with the humans so that they could discover the location ofEarthfrom stolen navigation data or through tracking devices in the weapons. Through this, the Covenant found two more worlds to attack.
By the time of theBattle of Jericho VIIin 2535, most of the Outer Colonies had been destroyed.
Continuing war (2536-2551)Humanity, heavily out-gunned, lost much ground to the Covenant.
On June 1, 2536, the Covenant finally broke into theInner colonies.
[9]From this point on, the war ground on in a predictable pattern; costly victories on the ground for UNSC forces, and near total Covenant space superiority.
[9][10]The UNSC managed to deal a heavy blow to the Covenant in 2537 with the destruction of the Covenant manufacturing plantK7-49inOperation: PROMETHEUS, and again during theSiege of the Atlas Moonsin the same year. However, these victories were offset by the loss ofNew Constantinople, its colonies atLeonis Minoris, and the total destruction of the force of Spartan-IIIs deployed to destroy the Covenant base.
Throughout the 2540s, the UNSC was dealt ever greater blows with the death of the Spartan-IISheiladuring theBattle of Miridemin 2544, defeat during theFall of Arcadia[9]and theloss of Paris IVin 2549. A major human success wasOperation: TORPEDOin 2545, the loss of 298 Spartan-IIIs were considered acceptable losses by UNSC High Command. The Spartan-IIRaid on the Third Fleet of Glorious Consequencealso proved the Covenant Empire was overwhelmingly powerful, but not invincible.
Of the few wins in the 2540s for the UNSC was theBattle of Psi Serpentisin 2543. This battle became colloquially known as Admiral Cole's last stand due to the presumed death ofAdmiral Preston J. Cole. In addition to the alleged death of Cole, over 300Covenantvessels, two fleets worth, were completely vaporized whenUNSCnuclear missilesdetonated inside the atmosphere ofViperidae, a super massive gas giant. This detonation spurred spontaneous fusion at the core of Viperidae, temporarily turning the super gas giant into a brown dwarf star. Cole's achievements in this battle alone were only rivaled by thedestructionofUnyielding Hierophantand the actions ofJohn-117throughout the course of the war. A painting depicting the battle, titled "Admiral Cole's Last Stand" was created and by2552, it hung on the wall of theHIGHCOM Facility Bravo-6inSydney, Earth.
[11]The battle was one of the most significant and strategically important victories for the UNSC in the entire war.
Towards the end of the war in 2552, the Office of Naval Intelligence was resigned to the fact that humanity may only have months left before the Covenant destroyed the remaining Inner colonies and moved on against Earth. To buy time, and perhaps survival, HIGHCOM ordered all available Spartan-IIs to return to Reach and leave onOperation: RED FLAG, a mission to locate the Covenant homeworld, capture a Prophet and force the Covenant into a cease-fire.
[12]The Final Year (2552)The last year of the war saw humanity's largest defeat, but also saw several of their greatest victories, coupled with the destruction of the Covenant as a galactic power. OnSigma Octanus IV, the Covenant weredefeated. On the ground, the Spartan-IIs secured a Forerunnerartifactcovered in symbols that the Covenant tried to transport out ofC√¥te d'Azur. However, in space, the Covenant placed aSpy probeonUNSCIroquois, which led the Covenant to the UNSC's stronghold and main headquarters,Reach.
TheFall of Reachthat followed resulted in staggering losses for both sides, but ended in a Pyrrhic Covenant victory.
UNSCPillar of Autumnwas among the surviving UNSC ships which fled the battle, and made a unique jump, as described by AI Cortana as using symbols on the retrieved artifact from Sigma Octanus IV, were in fact very old star charts. The coordinates led to the Forerunner ring world ofHalo.
The tide turns (2552-2553)Pillar of Autumnpushes through the Covenant blockade and escapesReach.
The Covenant suffered a major militarydefeatatInstallation 04. Here, the Human survivors from theHalcyon-class light cruiserPillar of Autumnformed an effective resistance to the Covenant forces in-system. Unwilling to risk damaging thesacred ring, the Covenant was forced to fight the Humans on Halo's surface rather than using its usual glassing tactics. The Covenant found the Humans very adept at fighting on the surface, employing their firearms and vehicles in classic guerrilla raids. Unable to counter the tactics employed by the Humans, the Covenant was defeated again and again, including one instance when humans boarded their grounded cruiser, theTruth and Reconciliation, and successfully escaped with a group of captives, including the captain of thePillar of Autumn,Captain Jacob Keyes.
[13]The battle on Halo then suddenly took a turn for the worst for both sides when the Covenant accidentally released an ancient and deadly parasitic race called theFlood. The Flood, having been imprisoned within Halo for many thousands of years, spread quickly throughout the ring, killing or assimilating every unsuspecting human and Covenant in their path.
During the course of the battle, the Spartan-II known asJohn-117discovered the true nature of Halo and proceeded to detonate the crashedPillar of Autumn'sengines, destroying the ring, and escaped,[14]much to the Covenant's dismay. Not only had the Covenant war machine been denied victory, a sacred artifact of the gods themselves had been destroyed. The result of the battle devastated Covenant morale in the short term. The destruction of Halo and the later loss of theflagshipAscendant Justiceto the surviving UNSC forces led toSupreme CommanderThel 'Vadameebeing disgraced and demoted before being branded with theMark of Shame,[15]leaving him dead in the eyes of theSangheili. Only the intervention of theProphet of Truthprevented 'Vadamee's certain execution. He was instead given the rank ofArbiterand sent to quell aHereticuprising that had taken root on theGas MinearoundThreshold.
[16]TheUNSCHome Fleetprepares to engage theCovenant Navy.
Shortly after the defeat at Halo, the Covenant had amassed a largefleetconsisting of five hundredJiralhanae-led warships, apparently intended to assaultEarthdirectly. The Covenant discovery of Earth was an accident after thePious Fleahad been intercepted by the UNSC stealth shipApocalypso. After retrieving a Forerunner artifact,Apocalypsomade aSlipspacejump directly to Earth. When the ship tumbled into real space and crashed on the moon, thePious Fleasent a message to the heart of the Covenant military, containing reconnaissance data, photos, star maps, and the coordinates of the Forerunner Artifact, which was now on Earth. However, the Covenant had not identified Earth as the Human homeworld, and theUnyielding Hierophant'sfleet was never expressly identified as an invasion force; this is merely a reasonable assumption made by the Human forces upon discovery of the fleet's destination ofSol.
This leaves the exact nature of the fleet's mission uncertain, as there is no definitive proof that the Covenant were intending to attack their enemy's homeworld. Nonetheless, the human survivors of Installation 04 correctly assessed the fleet to be a direct threat to Earth, and, using a captured Covenantflagship, lured the armada into a trap and destroyed it.
A few weeks after this defeat, theProphet of Regretled asmall fleetof fifteen ships to Earth[17]in order to locate a Forerunner artifact known as the "Ark." Though hopelessly outgunned by the UNSC's new orbital defense grid of MAC guns, the Prophet of Regret'sflagshipmanaged to break through the Human defenses toNew Mombasa.
[17]The Covenant ground troops quickly spread through the city,destroying both military and civilian resistance. When a counter-attack by theMarinesand John-117 inflicted heavy losses Regret was forced to flee, leaving his fleet to burn. His carrier jumped into Slipspace from within the city, damaging it severely.
[18]Unfortunately for Regret, four Human ships,In Amber Cladamong them, had followed them through their own Slipspace rupture toInstallation 05. With the orders "Find out why he came to Earth; why he came here," John-117 was hard-dropped with a complement ofOrbital Drop Shock Troopersto Delta Halo's surface. Led by John, the Humans forced their way through Regret's forces until they had reached the Prophet himself. At that moment,High Charity, having learned of Delta Halo, arrived and launched multiple waves ofPhantomdropships to aid Regret. However, they were withdrawn by the Prophet of Truth as part of his plan to remove the Sangheili from power in the Covenant. However, Truth had perhaps underestimated the full impact his 'reforms' would have on the Covenant's military campaign. John-117 ultimately assassinated Regret, dealing a heavy blow to the Empire's political structure. The Prophet of Truth then gave the order to glass the temple in which Regret was residing. John-117 barely escaped, only to be captured by theGravemind.
[19]The Great Schism begins.
Meanwhile, the majority of the Human forces onIn Amber Cladhad traveled to Delta Halo'sLibraryto obtain theIndex, the key to a successful firing of the Halo array. Originally, the Covenant had been unaware of the Index's importance. Fortunately, Arbiter Thel 'Vadamee had obtained343 Guilty Spark, the monitor ofInstallation 04, while destroying the Heretic base. The monitor, known to the Covenant as an Oracle, told the Prophets of the Index and the Arbiter was sent to retrieve the "Sacred Icon." The mission was complicated though by the unexpected release of the Flood. Despite this, the Arbiter successfully reached the Library and prevented the Humans from claiming the Index, kidnappingMiranda KeyesandSgt. Johnson. However, the Index was stolen from the Arbiter by theJiralhanae ChieftainTartarus, who was under the Prophets' orders to retrieve the Index, and kill the Arbiter.
[20]Although unsuccessful at the latter goal, with the Index secure, the Prophets then ordered theJiralhanaeto begin eradicating theSangheili, thus beginning theCovenant Civil War. Ultimately this led to the death ofTartarusat the hands of Vadamee and Johnson. A temporary alliance was formed between the Separatists and the Human forces. Delta Halo was prevented from firing by Miranda Keyes and in the chaos of High Charity,[21]the Flood infested theProphet of Mercy,[22]leaving the Prophet of Truth firmly in control over the Covenant.
The Battle of OnyxSpartansat theBattle of Onyx.
Long before the events surrounding Halo, the classifiedUEGcolony ofOnyxhad been designated the headquarters and training ground for the SPARTAN-III Program. However, the UNSC had no idea that the planet was in fact a hugeForerunnerconstruct, integral to theHalo Array, and containing trillions ofSentinels. After John-117's destruction of Alpha Halo, the Sentinels were roused by the disruption of the Halo network and the portal leading into theShield Worldat the planet's core began to close. At this time, a small group of Spartan-IIIs were training in a top honors exercise on the surface. After the humans failed to exchange the proper counter-responses, the Sentinels relabeled the "Reclaimers" as aboriginal subspecies and began to exterminate them. Led byKurt-051, the Spartan-IIIs fought a guerrilla war against the Sentinels until DoctorCatherine Halseyarrived on Onyx and explained the wider situation. Knowing that the Forerunner technology buried in Onyx's core could turn the tide of the war for humanity, Halsey used Forerunner technology to send a message toFleet AdmiralSir Terrence Hood, requesting reinforcements. Hood deployedBlue Teamto Onyx, who stole aCovenant destroyerto reach the planet in time.
Meanwhile, theCovenant Separatistsunder the leadership ofImperial AdmiralXytan 'Jar Wattinreehad deployed a fleet to Onyx to claim the "sacred relics" for their fight against the Jiralhanae and the otherLoyalists. Xytan would not live to hear of the results of this mission, as he and the majority of his fleet were annihilated by a UNSC Nova bomb recovered from Reach. After Blue Team made landfall,Fleet MasterVoro Nar 'Mantakree'sfleet arrived at Onyx, destroying hundreds of orbiting Sentinels before engaging UNSC forces in the Forerunner city below. 'Mantakree personally led the Covenant forces on the surface, before the UNSCBattlegroup Stalingradarrived and used indirect help from the Sentinels to destroy the majority of the Separatist fleet before being wiped out by reinforcements fromJoyous Exultation, with onlyone shipescaping.
On the surface, the Spartans had discovered theCore Room Antechamberand were preparing to enter the Shield World. They managed to hold off hundreds of Covenant troops before being forced to retreat into the Core, while Kurt-051 sacrificed himself by detonating a couple ofFENRIS Nuclear Warheads, killing the entire Separatist force. Following the Core being sealed, Onyx broke up into trillions of Sentinels, guarding the construct. With the Covenant Separatists dangerously depleted, the warlike Sangheili were finally forced to ally with their hated enemy, humanity.
Arrival of the Flood and Sangheili/Human Victory (2553)The Sangheili and Humans make ready to finish Truth and the Covenant atInstallation 00.
The battle between Covenant Separatists & Loyalists, raging over Installation 00.
Following the Flood infestation ofHigh Charity, theHigh Prophet of Truthled the remaining loyalist Fleet to Earth to complete what the previous mission to Earth had not. Little did he know that a Spartan-II had stowed away with him on board hisDreadnought. By the time Truth arrived at Earth, a full-scale battle in space and on the ground was underway between UNSC andCovenant Fleets.
[21]After a slug-fest lasting several weeks, the UNSC Homefleet was nearly wiped out. However, the Covenant Loyalist fleet was also vastly reduced and focused on securing an enormous unearthed Forerunner structure near the ruins of New Mombasa. With the arrival of John-117, the remaining UNSC forces launched an assault on the area, sweeping aside all Covenant resistance and finally launching an all-out attack on the Prophet of Truth'sForerunner ship.
Unfortunately, even in-atmosphere MAC strikes proved ineffective against the Forerunner dreadnought, and Truth quickly activated Voi'sportaland escaped. Events were further complicated by an unexpected attack by the Flood. Thanks to the timely arrival of the Sangheili, the Flood force was vanquished but not before Master Chief recovered a recording from Cortana, who had stayed behind onHigh Charity. Cortana's message told of a means to stop the Flood on the other end of the portal.
[23]A small fleet of Human and Sangheili forces was sent through the portal, leading them to the Ark, just outside theMilky Way galaxy. The Covenant Fleet above the Ark immediately attacked. Though the joint Human-Sangheili fleet was outnumbered 3-1, the battle ended in defeat for the Covenant Loyalist Fleet. Simultaneous to the space battle between Jiralhanae and Sangheili ships, UNSC forces were deployed to the surface of the Ark.
[24]Thefinal battle of the warwas fought in December2552as Truth attempted to activate theHalo rings. Led by John-117, the Human forces, despite fanatic resistance managed to smash through the remaining Covenant forces on the ground. The battle was complicated by the arrival ofHigh Charity. As the Flood began to spread, John and theArbiterwent on to thwart Truth, who died in mid-Flood-infection at the Arbiter's hand. John-117 deactivated the Halo Array and brought an end to that threat as well.
[25]With the Covenant forces completely shattered, Truth's death marked the effective end to the war. The Flood still remained a threat, but were destroyed by John-117, the Arbiter, Cortana and Sergeant Johnson by firing the Halo over the Ark, destroying the parasite and the installation. AlthoughForward Unto Dawnmanaged an emergency slipspace jump, the portal collapsed splitting the vessel in half. Trapped in the rear section of the frigate, John-117 placed himself into cryosleep until he could be retrieved, eventually drifting to aForerunner world. The UNSC's greatest soldier, and humanity's champion, was presumed dead.
[26]The ceremony held to honor the fallen.
Some months later, in March 3 of2553, amonument was erected on a hillsidenear the Portal to the Ark to commemorate the billions of men and women killed during the war, andJohn-117'sname was included as he was presumed MIA by the UNSC, as no Spartan could be declared dead for such morale purposes. Lord Hood shook hands with the Arbiter to signify an end to hostilities.
[26]The Covenant Civil War wouldcontinuefor at least another six years between Sangheili and Jiralhanae factions, further depleting their now crumbling infrastructure. The fate of the Prophet's was especially ironic, as the infestation of High Charity resulted in the near extinction of their race. The most destructive conflict in human history had ended in victory, but at a staggering cost. Both the UNSC and the Covenant Separatists then turned to the enormous task of rebuilding their once great societies after that.
