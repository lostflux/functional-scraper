Large-scale foundation models such as GPT-3 and DALL-E have taken the world of AI by storm. Previous AI tasks—from text categorization to object detection—can now be accomplished with much less curated labeled data. This is huge for many companies building AI solutions using prior technologies.
However, the new and even more exciting frontier is the exploration of using foundation models to generate things from email prose to software code, from design artifacts to visual arts. Companies such as Hugging Face and Stability AI continue to make steady progress making foundation models easily accessible, and the cost of training and running these types of models continues to decrease rapidly.
Through our deep expertise and our strategic relationship with AI2—a world-class AI research institute—we support entrepreneurs in turning these important technological advances into impactful products and companies.
