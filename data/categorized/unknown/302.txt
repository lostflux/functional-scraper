Guardian XO OverviewGuardian速XO速Full-Body Powered ExoskeletonMeet Guardian XOThe Guardian XO full-body exoskeleton is the world's first battery-powered industrial robot to combine human intelligence, instinct, and judgment with the power, endurance, and precision of machines.
Set to transform the way work gets done, the Guardian XO industrial exoskeleton augments operator strength without restricting freedom of movement to boost productivity while dramatically reducing injuries.
Expanding the Limits of Human PotentialBorn of a fundamental need to safely enable humans to be more productive, the Guardian XO full-body industrial exoskeleton robot is the perfect synergy of human and machine. It is revolutionizing the way work gets done.
Uniquely suited for safer, more productive manufacturing/assembly, construction, field service, and warehouse/logistics use cases, the Guardian XO enables a single person to deliver the productivity of many, while significantly reducing the risk of occupational injury.
The Guardian XO exoskeleton makes light work of heavy-duty tasks, empowering the operator to safely lift and manipulate up to 200 pounds (90 kilograms) without fatigue or strain.
Designed for Added Strength and EnduranceFull-body, powered-design reduces operator metabolic output and physical strain by offloading 100% of the exoskeleton's weight during useAddresses the 35 lb ~ 200 lb (15 kg to 90 kg) "lift gap" across a wide range of industrial processesRobotic suit amplifies operator strength by a factor of up to 20x (with maximum payload of up to 200 lb) and can also enable smoother lifting motion by dynamically compensating for gravity and inertia (for up to 100 lb per arm or 50 lb per arm when lifting at full extension)Battery-powered for Mobile Performance & Uninterrupted UseOnboard power source offers near-continuous operation with hot-swappable batteriesHot-swappable battery design extends operational uptime and flexibilitySupports modular and user-selectable end effectorsAdvanced Control Systems for Enhanced Maneuverability & Mobility"Get-out-of-the-way" control system uses robot-integrated sensors to eliminate latency, detecting operator movements within milliseconds24 Degrees of Freedom (DOFs) allow the operator to move freely and naturally in unstructured environments where larger machinery is unable to accessEquipped with user-friendly Operator Control Interface (OCI) for user controls and diagnostic notification display"Hands-free" mode allows operator to lock the suit's arms and simultaneously complete dexterous tasks requiring human hands, while carrying a heavy loadErgonomic, Safety-first Features for Operator Comfort & Injury PreventionIn the event of sudden power loss, redundant hardware and software limit-stops enable "passive braking" to prevent operator injuryHighly responsive control system enables operator to fluidly execute fall-prevention motions such as stumble-recoveryRobotic suit can be donned and doffed unassisted in less than 30 seconds, with additional provisions for sudden egressCan accommodate additional, customer-specialized protective gear; also equipped with lifting loop for docking and to enable attachment of fall-prevention device (FPD)Use CasesThe Guardian XO exoskeleton is uniquely equipped to increase worker safety and efficiency across a wide variety of industries, including:Industrial ManufacturingOil & GasMaritimeConstructionAutomotiveMilitary & DefenseDistribution & WarehousingAviation & AerospaceReady to Get Started?Contact us for a demo.
