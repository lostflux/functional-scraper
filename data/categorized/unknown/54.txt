Accessibility linksRSA main navigationTech and SocietyForum for ethical AIDecisions within public services are increasingly being made with the help of artificial intelligence (AI). These machines are generating a range of predictions, such as the likelihood of a defendant reoffending or the job performance of a candidate based on video interview.
While we all want to realise the potential of artificial intelligence, there are also known risks and costs associated with the use of AI. Striking the right balance between benefits and costs requires debate and conversation with all stakeholders. However, one of the biggest stakeholders – ordinary citizens – is virtually excluded.
The RSA’s Forum for Ethical AI seeks to remedy this. In the first phase of this work, we ran a citizens’ jury to explore the use of AI in decision-making. Drawing on the model of the RSA’sCitizens’ Economic Council, we convened participants to grapple with the ethical issues raised by this application of AI under different circumstances and enter into a deliberative dialogue about how companies, organisations, and public institutions should respond.
