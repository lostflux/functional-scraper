David R. KargerUROPs:My group often has openings for urops. You can find a list of ongoing projectshere. If you find one of them interesting, take a look at the relevant papers, then send me a resume and (informal) transcript. Urops should have completed 6.01 or equivalent; superurops 6.005 or equivalent.
I am a member of theComputer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratoryin theEECSdepartment atMIT.
My primary interest these days is in developing tools that help individuals manage information better. This involves studying people and current tools to understand where the problems are, creating and evaluating tools that address those problems, and deploying those tools to learn how people use them and iterate the whole process. I draw on whatever fields can help: information retrieval, machine learning, databases, and algorithms, but most often human computer interaction.
I begin my career in algorithms and continue to be interested in the topic, particularly in the application of algorithms to real world problems. This has led me to work in systems, networking, and coding and communication.
I have also spent some time working atAkamaiand consulting forGoogle,Microsoft, andVanu.
My resume ishere.
I recently helped to develop and teach6.s082: Design for the Web: Languages and User InterfacesI often teach6854: Advanced Algorithms. and6.856: Randomized Algorithms. I also occasionally teach adance class for PE creditThis site contains, among other things, a list of mypublications.
