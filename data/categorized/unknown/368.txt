PhysicsMathematicsBiologyComputer ScienceTopicsArchiveWhat's up inquantum physicsquantum physicsPuzzling Quantum Scenario Appears Not to Conserve EnergyByKatie McCormickRead LaterBy resolving a paradox about light in a box, researchers hope to clarify the concept of energy in quantum theory.
quantum physicsPhysicists Pin Down How Quantum Uncertainty Sharpens MeasurementsByBen BrubakerRead LaterThrowing out data seems to make measurements of distances and angles more precise. The reason why has been traced to Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle.
Quantized ColumnsBeyond the Second LawByNicole Yunger HalpernRead LaterThanks to the power of fluctuation relations, physicists are taking the second law of thermodynamics to settings once thought impossible.
quantum physicsMassive Black Holes Shown to Act Like Quantum ParticlesByCharlie WoodRead LaterPhysicists are using quantum math to understand what happens when black holes collide. In a surprise, they’ve shown that a single particle can describe a collision’s entire gravitational wave.
quantum physicsQuantum Complexity Tamed by Machine LearningByCharlie WoodRead LaterIf only scientists understood exactly how electrons act in molecules, they’d be able to predict the behavior of everything from experimental drugs to high-temperature superconductors. Following decades of physics-based insights, artificial intelligence systems are taking the next leap.
explainersHow the Physics of Resonance Shapes RealityByBen BrubakerRead LaterThe same phenomenon by which an opera singer can shatter a wineglass also underlies the very existence of subatomic particles.
quantum physicsQuantum Simulators Create a Totally New Phase of MatterByCharlie WoodRead LaterOne of the first goals of quantum computing has been to recreate bizarre quantum systems that can’t be studied in an ordinary computer. A dark-horse quantum simulator has now done just that.
particle physicsThe Algorithm That Lets Particle Physicists Count Higher Than TwoByCharlie WoodRead LaterThrough his encyclopedic study of the electron, an obscure figure named Stefano Laporta found a handle on the subatomic world’s fearsome complexity. His algorithm has swept the field.
quantum physicsAn Ultra-Precise Clock Links the Quantum World With GravityByKatie McCormickRead LaterTime was found to flow differently between the top and bottom of a single cloud of atoms. Physicists hope that such a system will one day help them combine quantum mechanics and Einstein’s theory of gravity.
