Is Artificial Intelligence a Feminist Issue?Produced by Coding Rights. What would you do if an AI system told you that your daughter will get pregnant in the next six months? Well, some families in Salta, Argentina, almost had the experience with the implementation of an AI system designed to “predict” unplanned pregnancies in teenagers based on where they live. It sounds like science fiction, but it is not. Our data bodies are progressively feeding different kinds of A.I. systems used by governments to "predict" future situations that can actually influence how we access public services and exercise our rights. Could the ever-increasing system of data collection, processing and prediction actually end up dictating who we are and who we will become? Considering the powerful forces pushing for these automated systems, it is possible that these predictions are more likely to amplify and automate existing inequalities and societal prejudices. In this episode we will explore some reasons why we should consider A.I as a feminist issue, and why artificial intelligence approaches and policies will continue to influence topics at the heart of several feminist agendas. Join us to listen to Coding Rights founder directress Joana Varon in conversations with enlightening decolonial feminists Paz Peña, consultant in technology, gender and social justice, speaking from Chile from Chile, and Paola Ricaurte, associate professor at Tecnologico de Monterrey and co-founder of Tierra Comum Network, speaking from Mexico.
