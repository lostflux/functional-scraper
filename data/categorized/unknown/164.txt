AboutMachineScienceConstructionAssemblyNews & MediaTopSupporting SystemsSurrounding the central reaction chamber are all of the systems that will work in concert to create a 150-million-degree plasma: powerful heating and current drive, diagnostic, cryogenic, cooling, fuelling, vacuum and power supply systems. Click on the system of your choice.
Tritium BreedingITER will offer a unique opportunity to test mockups of tritium breeding blankets—key technology for future fusion reactors—in a real fusion environment.
CODACCODAC (Control, Data Access and Communication) is the central control system responsible for operating the machine, with interfaces to more than 30 ITER plant systems.
Cooling WaterWater will be used in ITER to remove the heat generated during operation and to cool auxiliary systems heating and current drive systems, cryogenics, and power supply.
CryogenicsExtensive cryogenic technology will create and maintain low-temperature conditions for the magnet and vacuum pumping systems as well as some diagnostics.
DiagnosticsAs an experimental machine, ITER will be equipped with a large array of diagnostic instruments to provide the measurements necessary to control, evaluate and optimize plasma performance in ITER.
Fuel CycleReliable, high-speed, continuous fuelling is essential for ITER to meet its goal of operating at 500 MW for several minutes at a time.
Hot CellThe Hot Cell Facility will provide a secure environment for the processing, repair or refurbishment, testing, and disposal of components that have become activated by neutron exposure.
Power SupplyElectricity requirements for the ITER plant and facilities will range from 110 MW to up to 620 MW for peak periods of 30 seconds during plasma operation.
Remote HandlingRemote handling is required for ITER assembly tasks as well as for maintenance and upgrade tasks once nuclear operation (deuterium-tritium operation) is underway.
Heating and Current DriveThe temperatures inside the ITER Tokamak must reach 150 million °C—or ten times the temperature at the core of the Sun—in order for the gas in the vacuum chamber to reach the plasma state and for fusion to occur.
Vacuum SystemWith a pump volume of 1,400 m³ and 8,500 m³ respectively, the ITER vacuum vessel and cryostat count among the largest vacuum systems ever built.
