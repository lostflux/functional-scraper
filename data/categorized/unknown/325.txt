﻿In the last decade, technology has changed almost every aspect of our lives.
The companies that will thrive in our changing landscape are the ones that can quickly adapt and integrate technologies like artificial intelligence, robotics, 3D printing, big data, sensors, and extended reality. While people have an innate capacity to adapt to new circumstances, both personally and in a business context— to do so effectively, we need a thorough understanding of the forces shaping the world around us.

It’s disrupting traditional business processes, and they’re never going back to how they used to be. This disruption offers opportunities for business leaders and entrepreneurs—but they must understand the landscape and the crucial emerging technologies that are shaping it.
AI algorithms have been progressing exponentially due to increased computing power and data. Though we’re still in the space of “narrow” AI, these systems are growing steadily more complex. This talk explores disruptions of AI within multiple verticals and how companies can leverage these advances to stay ahead of the competition.
Blockchain is a distributed network that brings trust to decentralized computing. It allows people to make transactions without needing a traditional centralized authority to act as the middleman. This talk takes the audience on a journey through decentralized organizational models that will carry us into the future of urban niche organizations, space colonies, and virtual worlds.
Extended reality is the spectrum of immersion from augmented to virtual reality. In this session, you’ll get an overview of all the different technologies at play, what they're each good for, how they work, and how rapidly the market is expected to grow. Next, we’ll discuss the implications of these technologies, and how they can unleash truly superhuman abilities.
This session dives into how artificial intelligence is shaping the future of work. We will explore some of the future of work predictions, where they come from, and how we can proactively prepare. Participants will walk away with practical steps for their organization to adopt and a big vision for the world of work we can createWith the accelerating rate of change happening all around us, the way our bodies adapt to stress becomes a key determining factor in our success. Anxiety and depression are now the leading reasons people miss work globally. Leaders can and must learn to navigate turbulent times with grace. This session uses hands-on learning to explore modalities that “hack” the stress response.
What can we learn from the habits the most innovative leaders practice every day? How can any of us become a humanistic and innovative leader who brings out the best in their team and prepares them to think exponentially? How can we engage and align everyone to encourage an abundant mindset and a culture in which creative problem-solving and innovation thrive?
