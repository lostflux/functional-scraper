Original FootageAfter Noise ReductionAdvanced Noise ReductionDaVinci Resolve Studio includes some of the most sophisticated noise reduction tools in the world.
Temporal andspatial noise reduction tools can be used independently or together to help clean up and remove unwanted noise in virtually any image.
Original FootageAfter CorrectionLens DistortionDaVinci Resolve Studio includes a lens correction feature that allows you to analyze a clip and correct for spherical lens distortion or other aberrations. It uses advanced image analysis and processing algorithms for incredibly high quality results!Professional HDR ScopesThe HDR scopes in DaVinci Resolve Studio are capable of measuring and providing detailed information about ST.2084 and HLG images. This allows you to replace the 10‑bit scale of the scopes with a scale based on nit values, or cd/m2, instead.
Stereoscopic 3DDaVinci Resolve Studio features a complete set of tools for editing and grading stereoscopic 3D projects. You have total control over stereo specific clip properties such as convergence, floating windows, eye alignment, mastering and output.
Remote GradingRemote grading lets colorists work interactively with clients across the globe. It allows two matching DaVinci Resolve systems to be synchronized via an internet connection so that changes made on one system are immediately visible on the other.
DaVinci ColorspaceTransform LanguageUnlike LUTs, which rely on simple lookup tables, DaVinci color transformation scripts are GPU accelerated bits of code that directly transform images using combinations of math functions. That makes them extremely fast and non destructive.
Scriptingand AutomationDaVinci Resolve Studio features support for both Python and LUA scripting, along with developer APIs that allow you to add workflow integrations and custom encoding options. This lets studios of all sizes create deeply integrated custom workflows.
Workflow Integration Plug‑insDaVinci Resolve Studio supports workflow integration plug-ins for connecting to local and remote asset management, automation systems and more. Users can write their own plug-in and interact with DaVinci Resolve's JavaScript APIs.

Feature film quality effect plug‑ins can cost hundreds, even thousands of dollars, making DaVinci Resolve Studio incredibly affordable!DaVinci Neural EngineThe DaVinci Neural Engine uses state of the art deep neural networks and machine learning, to power many of the features found exclusively in DaVinci Resolve Studio.
