PhysicsMathematicsBiologyComputer ScienceTopicsArchiveWhat's up influid dynamicsfluid dynamicsMathematicians Coax Fluid Equations Into Nonphysical SolutionsByLeila SlomanRead LaterThe famed Navier-Stokes equations can lead to cases where more than one result is possible, but only in an extremely narrow set of situations.
mathematical physicsDeep Learning Poised to ‘Blow Up’ Famed Fluid EquationsByJordana CepelewiczRead LaterFor centuries, mathematicians have tried to prove that Euler’s fluid equations can produce nonsensical answers. A new approach to machine learning has researchers betting that “blowup” is near.
fluid dynamicsAn Injection of Chaos Solves Decades-Old Fluid MysteryByAdam MannRead LaterIn the 1960s, drillers noticed that certain fluids would firm up if they flowed too fast. Researchers have finally explained why.
mathematical physicsMathematicians Prove Melting Ice Stays SmoothByMordechai RorvigRead LaterAfter decades of effort, mathematicians now have a complete understanding of the complicated equations that model the motion of free boundaries, like the one between ice and water.
geometryMathematicians Identify Threshold at Which Shapes Give WayByMordechai RorvigRead LaterA new proof establishes the boundary at which a shape becomes so corrugated, it can be crushed.
Abstractions blogNew Quantum Algorithms Finally Crack Nonlinear EquationsByMax G. LevyRead LaterTwo teams found different ways for quantum computers to process nonlinear systems by first disguising them as linear ones.
combinatoricsA Mathematician’s Unanticipated Journey Through the Physical WorldByKevin HartnettRead LaterLauren Williams has charted an adventurous mathematical career out of the pieces of a fundamental object called the positive Grassmannian.
fluid dynamicsAn Unexpected Twist Lights Up the Secrets of TurbulenceByDavid H. FreedmanRead LaterHaving solved a central mystery about the “twirliness” of tornadoes and other types of vortices, William Irvine has set his sights on turbulence, the white whale of classical physics.
MultimediaThe Map of MathematicsByKevin HartnettRead LaterExplore our surprisingly simple, absurdly ambitious and necessarily incomplete guide to the boundless mathematical universe.
