However, they also present one of the most challenging research problems. In essence, semiconductor manufacturing today lacks methods for depositing nanomaterials at predefined chip locations without chemical contamination. We think that graphene, one of the thinnest, strongest, most flexible and most […]Continue readingShare this post:IBM Research-BrazilSmarter Farms: Watson Decision Platform for AgricultureBringing the power of Watson to farmers Agriculture, a $2.4 trillion industry, is a foundation of economies worldwide. Factors such as climate change, population growth and food security concerns have propelled the industry into seeking more innovative approaches to protecting and improving crop yield. As a result, artificial intelligence is steadily emerging as part of […]Continue readingShare this post:IBM Research-BrazilNo Farms, No FoodAI-powered technology will help farmers health-check soil and water Agriculture consumes more than 70 percent of the world’s annual water usage. With small farms producing nearly 80 percent of food for the developing world, ensuring the quality and safety of our water supply is critical. Environmental analysis for agriculture often relies on expensive and time-consuming […]Continue readingShare this post:IBM Research-BrazilAI and the Future of OilIBM and Galp, a Portuguese energy group with a global footprint, have developed an AI-based advisor to enhance seismic interpretation in the oil and gas exploration area. This tool can facilitate creation of enhanced geological models, risk assessment of new prospects, and optimization of the placement of new oil wells. As global energy consumption increases […]Continue readingShare this post:IBM Research-BrazilTwo IBM Researchers to Speak at TEDGlobal 2017 in AfricaThis week in Arusha, Tanzania, hundreds will gather for one of the most highly anticipated events of the year: TEDGlobal. The sold out event brings together entrepreneurs, business leaders, technologists, dreamers and doers to talk about the challenges and opportunities on the African continent. Representing IBM’s Africa Labs scientists Drs. Abdigani Diriye and David Moinina […]Continue readingShare this post:IBM Research-BrazilBig oil’s next gusher is at the nanoscaleLast year the world consumed almost 97 million barrels of oil per day. What if I told you that many more barrels still remain in those same wells? Deep inside the rock, 60 percent and more of a reservoir’s oil remains trapped in capillaries which are sometimes only tens to hundreds of nanometers wide (For […]Continue readingShare this post:IBM Research-BrazilPathologists Look Forward to a Future with Deep Learning and Neural NetworksDeep learning and neural networks are making significant progress in identifying cancer mitosis. A critical step in the diagnosis of cancer is the analysis of a patient’s biopsy tissue sample, which sometimes can be as small as a pinhead. Even with such a small sample, pathologists can test for the absence or presence of tumor cells […]Continue readingShare this post:IBM ResearchThe world is our labLearn moreConnect with us
