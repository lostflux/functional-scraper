An inside look"In Season 2, I've gone back inside the lab... and, I must say, I've seen some pretty extraordinary things."What is artificial intelligence? Is it safe? And what’s it used for?We’re often asked these questions at talks, science festivals, and in conversation with family and friends. So we partnered with the brilliant mathematician and broadcaster Hannah Fry to create DeepMind: The Podcast, which explores the latest in AI and uncovers the extraordinary ways it’s transforming our world.
In the second season - coming soon - Hannah discovers how AI is accelerating science, takes an in-depth look at the challenges and potential of building advanced problem-solving systems known as artificial general intelligence (AGI), and explores what it takes to ensure AI is built to benefit society.
