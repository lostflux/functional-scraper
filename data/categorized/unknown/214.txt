IBM Research-AustraliaLargest Dataset for Document Layout Analysis Used to Ingest COVID-19 DataDocuments in Portable Document Format (PDF) are ubiquitous with over 2.5 trillion available from insurance documents to medical files to peer-review scientific articles. It represents one of the main sources of knowledge both online and offline. For example, just recently The White House made available the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset, which included links to 45,826 papers […]Continue readingShare this post:IBM Research-AustraliaMeet Ari, the Smart Bike that Helps you Catch Green LightsAs more bikes take to the city streets than ever, researchers at RMIT have designed Ari, a smart e-bike that could help riders cruise the ‘green wave’.

Continue readingShare this post:IBM Research-AustraliaAI and the Eye: Deep Learning for Glaucoma DetectionGlaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness in the world, impacting approximately 2.7 million people in the U.S alone [1]. It is a complex set of diseases and, if left untreated, can lead to blindness. It’s a particularly large issue in Australia, where only 50% of all people who have it are actually diagnosed […]Continue readingShare this post:IBM Research-AustraliaBionics in Real LifeControlling Prosthetic Limbs With Thought and AI Bionics is no longer the stuff of science fiction. For some amputees, the ability to carry out daily living activities depends on how efficiently and reliably they can bypass broken pathways between the brain and a prosthetic limb. Robust brain-machine interfaces can help restore mobility for these people. […]Continue readingShare this post:IBM Research-AustraliaIoT and Machine Learning to Reduce Energy Use in Cooling SystemsA new approach to operating a building’s cooling system using machine learning techniques and Internet of Things (IoT) data can help to drive down energy consumption and costs, as the global demand for energy increases. The buildings sector is one of the largest energy-consuming entities, accounting for a staggering 40 percent of global energy consumption […]Continue readingShare this post:IBM Research-AustraliaNew research shows link between agrochemicals and risk of parasitic diseaseFarmers worldwide face mounting pressure to increase agricultural yields to keep up with human population growth. Consequently, chemical use is on the rise – in many cases a cocktail of chemicals, from fertilizers to herbicides to insecticides. But in countries where human population growth is highest, including China, South East Asia and South America, these […]Continue readingShare this post:IBM Research-AustraliaIBM Research at IJCAI: Pushing new AI frontiers from Down UnderFor the first time in 26 years, Australia is hosting the globally revered International Joint Conference for Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI). The greatest minds in artificial intelligence (AI) from across the globe will descend on Melbourne next week to present the latest advancements in training machines to learn, reason and interact in a natural, human-like way. […]Continue readingShare this post:IBM Research-AustraliaSpotting Diabetic Retinopathy by analyzing medical images pixel by pixelMedical images are a rich source of data for clinicians in their diagnosis and treatment of diseases. In fact, specialized fundus photography can help pinpoint tiny pathologies in the eyes of diabetics, revealing signs of diabetic retinopathy (DR), one of the world’s leading causes of blindness. In the vast majority of these cases, early detection […]Continue readingShare this post:IBM Research-AustraliaWatson defining this era’s fashion zeitgeistFashion is a multi-billion-dollar industry with social and economic implications, worldwide. And this year’s Melbourne Spring Fashion Week (MSFW) was an opportunity for IBM Research to showcase how cognitive technology can transform how fashion designers engage and connect with their customers. This is the third year IBM has partnered with City of Melbourne for MSFW […]Continue readingShare this post:IBM ResearchThe world is our labLearn moreConnect with us
