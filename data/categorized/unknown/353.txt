ContentsBackgroundAfter theFirst Battle of RequiemtheUNSCInfinityreturned toEarth.
Andrew Del Riowas stripped of his position ascaptainof the warship, and the newly promotedCaptain Laskytook his place.
[4]Six months after theUr-Didact's attack onNew Phoenix,Infinitywas ordered to return toRequiembyFLEETCOM. Several newSpartanandMarinefireteams were deployed toInfinityalong with hundreds ofengineers and scientists.
[3]BattleThe Space BattleShortly before 0500 hours on February 7,2558,UNSCInfinityemerged from slipspace in the midst of aCovenantfleet, plowing through aRCS-class armored cruiserbefore the Covenant could react.
Infinitythen launched her complement ofStrident-class heavy frigatesand hundreds ofBroadsword fighters, which were engaged by Seraph fighters.
Infinitybegan preparing a strike force for deployment to the interior surface of Requiem. Hundreds ofScorpionsandWarthogswere loaded ontoPelican dropships, plus dozens ofSpartanandMarinefireteams. As soon as enough Covenant ships had been cleared to make a clean shot for Requiem's portal to its interior, the ground forces were deployed in a massive invasion.
[3]As the waves of ground forces continued to swarm into Requiem,Infinityand her frigate escorts pushed the Covenant fleet back and secured a UNSC foothold above Requiem.
Initial OperationsAt exactly 0500 hours (5:00 a.m. Zulu Time),[3]operations to secure a ground-side footholdbegan when a large task force ofSpartanandMarinefireteams was deployed to aCovenant-held continent (designatedREQ-931-B) on the interior surface ofRequiem. The deployment area was largely a barren desert with deep canyons and tall mesas, earning it the shorthand name, "the Quarry." At least five Spartan fireteams participated in the attack, includingCastle,Majestic,Domino,Ivy, andCrimson, in addition to numerous Marine forces and significant armor. SpartanFireteam Crimsonwas deployed and successfully neutralized the power sources before being extracted and brought back toInfinity.
[5]As the air space within Requiem's outer shell was cleared of Covenant forces more and moreUNSCreinforcements arrived until the continent was completely devoid of Covenant.
Infinity Sciencebegan assembling pre-fabricated labs on the surface and command posts were set up as theUNSCbegan to build up their presence on the surface. However the Covenant still had installations in the region that were being remotely powered.
Promethean ResistanceASpartan-IVfightingPromethean forces.
AsUNSCpersonnel spread across theplanetthey consistently drove theCovenantback untilPromethean forceswere encountered. These AIs proved more than a match for almost allUNSCforces exceptSpartan-IVs.
[6]Because of this, Spartan fireteams were deployed to areas with high numbers of Prometheans to clear and secure them. SeveralForerunnerstructures inRequiem's frosty mountains were the site of some of the fiercest combat against Promethean forces during the entire campaign. This location, designated "the Fortress," was part of Requiem'steleportation grid, meaning that for every Promethean killed, two more could take its place. Eventually the entire region was cleared by SpartanFireteams, includingCrimsonandMajestic, allowingInfinity Scienceto move in and set up research facilities.
Scientific ExplorationAs the ground battle waged on,Jul 'Mdama's Covenantbegan to be pushed further and further back, although a large portion of its fleet was still biding its time, hidden fromInfinityaboveRequiem's exterior surface. As more and moreForerunnersites came underUNSCcontrol,Infinity Sciencebegan selecting points of interest where they wished to establish labs. Because these points of interest were usually safeguarded byPromethean AIsor solidCovenantresistance, a large number ofSpartanswere deployed to secure the locations.
Fireteam Crimsonmade one of the most interesting finds: aForerunnerartifact that was brought aboard theUNSCInfinityto keep it safe from Covenant attempts at re-acquisition and teleporting Prometheans. The artifact began to have alarming behavior once aboard the flagship, however, including an electro-magnetic pulse that neutralized the ship's engines and caused the disappearance of the Chief Engineer,Dr. Henry Glassman. The artifact ultimately settled down, becoming dormant but immobile on one ofInfinity's decks.
[6]At the request ofCaptain Lasky, theONIprowlerUNSCAladdinbroughtDr. HalseyaboardInfinityin order to assist in the investigation of the mysterious artifact.
[7]Meanwhile,Infinity Sciencecontinued to operate on Requiem's surface, with several notable science teams including Galileo, Gagarin and Copernicus. With the continued research ofForerunnerfacilities, word of a spec opsSangheili Zealotteam known as the "Silent Blade," began to circulate amongstUNSCpersonnel.
Parg VolAfter a number ofUNSCoperations, intelligence reachedInfinitythatParg Vol, aSangheiliterroristand known associate of Jul 'Mdama, was on the surface ofRequiemand was responsible for a suddenCovenantcounter-attack that had lost the UNSC several command posts and science labs, particularly in "the Quarry." After pin-pointing his exact location,SpartanFireteam Crimsonwas stealthily deployed groundside to assassinate the commander. However, Vol was surrounded by considerable ground forces, meaning that Crimson was detected before reaching him, and that he was able to escape byPhantom. After the Spartans had killed all remaining Covenant forces they found that Vol had amassed an armory of UNSC armor and ordnance. Vol continued to evade his would-be assassins, appearing for minutes at a time before disappearing later. Finally he was cornered by Crimson in a grassy region of Requiem designated "the Gate." Here he made his last stand against the Spartans, alongsideSangheili CommandersandZealotsbefore finally being overwhelmed and killed.
The Didact's HandJul 'Mdama and Henry GlassmanDespiteCrimson'ssuccessful hit, the scene of the battle was grim. Spartan Fireteam Castle had been killed andInfinitygot word thatFleet MasterJul 'Mdamahad arrived in person to oversee operations onRequiem. Known as the Didact's Hand, 'Mdama was present when the Covenant capturedDr. Glassmanafter his disappearance from the UNSCInfinity. 'Mdama then provided Glassman with capturedUNSCscientific gear and ordered him to begin working on what the fleetmaster believed was the cairn of theThe Librarian'sDurance.
[8]At some point shortly after 'Mdama's arrival, the Covenant secured the controls toRequiem'steleportation grid, allowing them the same versatility and ease of transportation as thePrometheans. This became a massive thorn in the UNSC's side as they began hunting down 'Mdama.
Spartan fireteamsCrimsonandMajesticbecame the fleetmaster's primary pursuers. After locating theSangheiliseveral times only to have him disappear,Infinityfinally launched a massive barrage with the intention of taking him out before he could use Requiem's portal system. They underestimated the efficiency and alacrity ofForerunnerteleportation technology, and 'Mdama escaped, but not before dropping aForerunner-designed cubethat theCovenant BattleNetreferred to as the Didact's Gift. The UNSC swiftly secured the cube and rushed it to the nearestresearch facility,Galileo Base; not knowing that 'Mdama had intentionally let it fall into human hands.
The Didact's GiftAnthony MadsenandGabriel Thornefighting atGalileo Base.
Once atGalileo Base, ascience teambegan running diagnostics on the Didact's Gift whileFireteam Crimsonwaited for evac. Their ride was postponed afterJared Millerpicked up signatures from numerousPhantomsandBanshees, allen routeto Galileo Base.
Kig-Yarstrike teams arrived first, alongsideUnggoy HeaviesandImperials. Soon on their heels wereSangheiliandMgalekgolokill teams withGhostsandShades. After an earlier attack, the base defenses had been upgraded with large AA rocket batteries. Unbeknownst to any of theSpartanspresent, one of the base's scientists had rerouted the power from the defenses to stabilize a nuclear reaction project. Crimson reactivated the rocket batteries, stopping allCovenantreinforcements from arriving, only to receive a frantic warning from the scientist telling them they needed to deactivate the base batteries unless they wished to be vaporized. As Crimson crossed the facility to reach the master terminal, severallancesofPromethean Battlewagonsteleported in, surrounding them. Crimson finally reached the master terminal and deactivated the facility's defenses. Immediately the Covenant began returning with a vengeance.
Fireteam Majesticwas deployed to the facility to take the Didact's Gift back toInfinitywhile Crimson covered them, however, by the time Majestic had landed and retrieved the artifact, the airspace above the facility was overrun with Banshees and Phantoms. After being pinned down and cut off from theirPelicanwithin one of Galileo's prefabricated labs,Gabriel Thornemanaged to board a passing Banshee and hold off Covenant air support while Crimson cleaned up ground forces and the rest of Majestic ferried the Didact's Gift toInfinity.
Jul 'Mdamaand his second-in-command, Gek, watched the battle from a nearby cliff. As the last Phantom was destroyed Gek warned Jul that the Spartans were escaping with the Gift. Jul merely calmed him with a wave of his hand and informed him that it had been part of his plan all along to let the artifact fall into human hands.
[9]Once onboardInfinity,Dr. Halseyidentified the artifact as theAI matrix ofaPromethean Knight. After accidentally activating it, she found it contained human memories ofNew Phoenixfrom the attack six months prior. This caused Thorne to go and personally examine the teleportation artifact that had been recovered earlier in the battle, not realizing its true purpose. After briefly making physical contact, he was teleported to a volcanic region ofRequiemdesignated "the Cauldron," without weapons or a helmet for comms. After climbing to his feet he realized that a lance of sword-wieldingSangheiliwas waiting for him.
[9]Continued OperationsThe location in the "Quarry" whereCrimsonwas ambushed.
Gabriel Thorne's absence was not immediately noticed. For several hours it was business as usual on the surface ofRequiem.
Fireteam Crimsonhelped anInfinity Scienceteam shut down the planet'steleportation gridand ward off a subsequentPrometheanattack. As the team began conducting crucial in-field tests on the teleportation grid at Gagarin Base,Warbird Companywas sent to secure the area, only to be attacked by the Silent Blade once again. ACRS-class light cruiserloomed overhead and began dropping reinforcements. Fireteam Crimson simultaneously protected the remnants of the science team and aided Warbird in defendingUNSCtech. TheSpartanseventually eradicated every member of the notorious Silent Blade, but continued to be assailed by Covenant reinforcements from the cruiser above. SpartanFireteam Shadowmanaged to board the ship while Crimson and Warbird held off Covenant on the ground. The Spartans sabotaged the ship's engines and escaped before it self-destructed. With their air support gone the Covenant quickly became disorganized and were defeated by UNSC forces.
[10]Despite losing a ship and yet anotherForerunnerartifact,Jul 'Mdamawas undeterred. He had managed to gain access to the comms ofDr. Halsey'sdata padand anonymously plied her with questions. When he inquired what she knew of theThe Librarian, Halsey was so shocked that it aroused suspicion from the nearbyPalmer, who promptly confiscated the data pad and escorted Halsey to the brig. The setback proved of little consequence, however, asDr. Glassmanmanaged to somehow activate theLibrarian'scrypt. It was at this point that Spartan Thorne's disappearance was noticed and Spartan Fireteams were mobilized to search for him. Fireteam Crimson arrived at a location in the "Quarry." Intelligence had located a large contingent of Covenant forces that appeared to be guarding something. After a fierce firefight the Spartans discovered that they were not guarding a Spartan, but a large stockpile of UNSC equipment. The fireteam was recalled to search another location, but theirPelicanwas shot down, leaving the Spartans surrounded by dozens ofPhantomsand aCRS-class light cruiser. As wave after wave of aircraft arrived,Millerfrantically called for reinforcements.
Crimson and IcebreakerThe HarvesterEventuallyCrimsonwas overwhelmed and subdued.
Millerlost contact with them and theSpartanswere beaten senseless. Upon awakening, they found themselves secured by energy manacles within a largeForerunnercomplex. Unsurprisingly, all weapons and equipment had been taken from them. They regained consciousness, which allowed Miller to triangulate their vital signs and order an airstrike on several nearbyCovenantlances. The violent blasts weakened the energy manacles long enough for one of the Spartans to break free and kill the nearby sentry, freeing the rest of the fireteam. Crimson then captured severalGhostsand pushed through the large Forerunner ruins to a makeshift hangar. There they found a missing team ofMarines,Fireteam Icebreaker, thatInfinitycommand had assumed KIA. The Spartans freed the Marines including the team leader,Lieutenant Murphy, who helped Crimson capture and escape in aPhantom.
[11]Miller had re-established communications at this point and began guiding the teams back toUNSCInfinity. The Covenant had not yet realized the captured Phantom was no longer friendly, and instructed the vessel to set down at a secure location. Murphy did so and Crimson disembarked, killing all Covenant present and discovering yet another cache of UNSC weapons gear.
Rolandthen requested that the Spartans investigate several nearby terminals. The A.I. was able to transmit a computer worm via the Mjolnir armor, giving him direct access to certain portions of the enemy battle-net. Crimson then fought through a contingent of Mgalekgolo and returned to the captured Phantom. Miller re-routed the Fireteam to several more locations before returning toInfinity. At one location, Crimson was intended to provide backup to Spartan Fireteam Switchback in disrupting a Covenant archaeological dig, however Crimson only found several IFF tags and heavy Covenant/Promethean resistance. The fireteam then disabled a nearbyHarvesterthat was assisting in the dig and returned to the Phantom so as to deploy to one final location.
Thorne and GlassmanThorne is greeted by Sangheili on the surface of RequiemAt theLibrarian's cairn,Jul 'Mdamaand the nearbySangheiliwere awestruck at the spectacle caused byDr. Glassman's activation of the artifact. So awestruck, in fact, that they did not even notice when the doctor backed past them and ran from the chamber. As soon as 'Mdama discovered that the artifact would only open tohumantouch, he flew into a rage and sent all nearby Sangheili after the escaped scientist, including his lieutenant,Gek 'Lhar. At the same time,Gabriel Thornefought empty-handed against the Sangheili surrounding them. He managed to kill all but two before being knocked unconscious by a blow to the head. The two surviving Sangheili dragged him back to their headquarters, reaching the front door just as Glassman did. Thorne re-awoke as the Sangheili refocused their attention on the doctor. The Spartan then punched the nearest Sangheili in the back of the knee, grabbed the Sangheili'sStorm Rifleand killed them both. Meanwhile, Gek primed Glassman's explosive vest via remote detonator. Thorne realized this and tore the vest from Glassman, flung it into the tunnel and hurled himself and the doctor out of the blast radius as the vest exploded. The explosion killed every pursuing Sangheili except Gek, who set off in a vengeful rage after the two humans.
Attack onInfinityThe Prometheans arrive onInfinityInfinityunder attack from the Covenant fleetMeanwhile, asDr. Halseysat in the brig of theUNSCInfinity,Rolandarrived and asked why she attempted to communicate with an unknown intelligence about classified material. After a brief interchange, Halsey used the pass-phrase override "UNDID IRIDIUM" to gain control of the inquisitive A.I. and then use him to move unsuspected to the captain's ready room. Once there she perused all the material she could find for information on theLibrarianand theDidact's Hand, also discovering thatJohn-117was still alive and had survived the destruction of theArk. She then used the terminal to communicate withJul 'Mdama. She offered her assistance in exchange for what they both wanted: the Librarian's secrets. At that moment though Roland regained control of his confused matrices and pulled the plug, and alertingLasky. Just as the captain was about to have Halsey interred in a cryo-tube, alarms sounded across the ship.
Prometheanshad gained access to the massive vessel and taken all hands by surprise. MostSpartanandMarinefireteams were deployed onRequiemand the Prometheans quickly overran most of the ship.
[12]AllUNSCassets were recalled to the ship, but at that moment the rest ofJul 'Mdama's Covenantfleet arrived, composed primarily ofCRS-class light cruisers, and attackedInfinity. At this point,Fireteam Crimsonreached the battle, still in the capturedPhantom.
Infinity's automated point-defense turrets could not differentiate between the thousands of incoming enemy spacecraft and Crimson was hit.
Lieutenant Murphybarely guided the out-of-control dropship into one ofInfinity's hangars, the bay's vacuum shields decelerating the dropship enough to allow all of its passengers to survive.
Fireteam Crimsonpromptly went to work, clearing the hangar and locking down all bay doors on the port side of the ship, preventing furtherCovenantboarders.
[13]At that moment though, teams on board made two discoveries: first the Covenant had internally disabled all the port defenses, leavingInfinityopen to attacks from the Covenant fleet, and second that the Covenant had UNSC nuclear devices with them fromParg Vol'ssupply and had armed the devices at key points throughout the ship.
Fireteam Kodiakdisarmed the nukes in the ship's armory whileFireteam Crimsondisarmed the nukes in the engine room. With the nukes disarmed and back in UNSC control, Crimson re-activated the ship's port defenses, which promptly destroyed all adjacent ships. The remainder of the Covenant fleet fled as the UNSC re-grouped. ButInfinitywas not safe yet. As Lasky escorted Halsey to the bridge, it was brought to his attention thatInfinitywas unable to move from its current spot because it was trapped by a sort ofSlipspaceanchor. As he turned his back, aPromethean Knightappeared, knockedCommander Palmerto the deck, grabbed Dr. Halsey, and disappeared again.
[14]Gek 'Lhar's DeathThorneandGekfightingAs the massive battle waged hundreds of miles over their heads,Gabriel ThorneandDr. Glassmantrekked through the dusty canyons near "Sniper's Alley" inREQ-153-N[15]to reachGalileo Base. Glassman sat down to take a rest and Thorne stopped to glance around. Realizing that something was amiss, he told Glassman to get to safety just asGek 'Lharemerged frominvisibility, swinging hisEnergy Swordand slicing Thorne'sStorm Riflein half. Gek tossed Glassman aside like a ragdoll and attempted to truncate Thorne, who disarmed him in the process. Thorne managed to knock theSangheiliassassin to the ground. The Spartan then tried to break Gek's skull with a boulder, but the Sangheili caught it, flipped Thorne to the ground and brought the stone down on his chest, stunning him. Glassman was attempting to reach the fallen Energy Sword, but was stopped when Gek stepped on his outstretched arm, breaking it. Just as the Sangheili was preparing to execute the downed Spartan, he was shot in the head three times byDeMarco, who had shown up with the rest ofMajestic. The Spartans looted his body, then returned with the injured Glassman to an LZ forPelicanevac.
The Janus KeyWith the abduction ofDr. Halseyby enemy forces,Admiral Osman, head ofONI, orderedLaskyto assassinate the doctor lest theCovenantglean any sensitive intel from her.
Sarah Palmerwas deployed fromInfinitydespite Lasky's admonishments to the contrary. As soon as she was out of earshot Lasky contactedFireteam Majesticand asked them to rescue Dr. Halsey, without telling them that Palmer wasen route. TheSpartansreturned to the Covenant's base and engaged the sentries outside whileThorneused his recently acquiredactive camouflageunit to slip inside. At the same time, Dr. Halsey unlocked the shield set up byGlassmanand entered theLibrarian's shrine. Inside she was greeted by theForerunner's imprint, which presented to her the two pieces of theJanus Key, an artifact that would reveal the location of every piece of Forerunner technology in thegalaxy. Once she reappeared outside the shrine,Jul 'Mdamasnatched one of the halves away from her, not noticing the second piece in Halsey's hand. At that moment Thorne broke a nearby sentry's back, killing the other with hisassault rifle. Halsey tossed the other half of the Janus Key to the Spartan. Just as a sword-wielding warrior was about to kill him from behind, it was felled by Palmer. A pair ofPromethean Knightsappeared to protect 'Mdama and Halsey, but not before Palmer shot the doctor in thecarotid artery. The rest of Majestic appeared and fought through the army of Prometheans alongside Palmer. Before they could reach the cornered 'Mdama, a Knight appeared and teleported away with him and the injured doctor.
End of RequiemJul 'Mdama, activatingRequiem's failsafe and sealing theplanet'sfate.
Jul 'Mdama, having completed his mission of retrieving theJanus Key, and of anchoringInfinityto Requiem, activated a secluded terminal that would cause Requiem to fall into the sun and dragInfinitywith it. 'Mdama and most of the Covenant ground forces then used the remaining ships in the Covenant fleet to flee theShield Worldand enterslipspace. Lasky saw the ships fleeingen masseright pastInfinityand was rightly suspicious. At that moment the entire vessel rocked asRequiembegan its rapid journey to the center of its star. Lasky ordered an immediate evacuation of allUNSCpersonnel from the surface and with the aid of Dr. Glassman, tasked Palmer, Majestic and Crimson with the disabling of the artifacts anchoringInfinityto Requiem. After their task was complete, both teams escaped through Requiem's disintegrating outer shell and returned toInfinity, which jumped to safety as Requiem entered the star, causing a supernova.
[16]AftermathJul 'Mdamaspeaking toDr. Halseyover one half of theJanus Key.
The UNSCInfinityescaped with minimal damage and only minor injuries sustained by the crew. As the vessel made its way back to theSol system,Dr. Glassmananalyzed the half of theJanus Keyrecovered byGabriel Thorne. He discovered that it was inert at the molecular level, and correctly gathered that it was only part of a largerForerunnerdevice.
Infinityarrived atEarthon March 3, whereupon bothLaskyandPalmerwere summoned toBravo-6for debriefing.
Admiral Osmanwas highly displeased with the loss of bothRequiemandDr. Halsey, and pulledInfinityfrom its task of followingJul 'Mdama's trail, assigning theUNSCVociferousto follow the cultist. Afterwards,Admiral Hoodarrived on board theInfinityto personally reassign the vessel to aidthe Arbiteron an upcoming diplomatic mission.
[2]Meanwhile,Jul 'Mdamaescaped to a safe location along with the surviving remnants of the Storm Fleet and the other half of theJanus Key.
Dr. Halseywas brought aboard theSong of Retribution, where Jul was forced to amputate and cauterize her arm to keep her alive. Upon reawakening, he demanded her assistance in return for saving her life. Believing that theUNSChad ordered the hit on her, she reminded him that she no longer had any allies or friends, and that threatening her would not help him. She then proposed a counter-offer: she would help him unlock the secrets of the Janus Key, and in return, he would help her exact vengeance against the UNSC.
The Second Battle of Requiem also helped test and bring about change to several pieces of equipment.
Lethbridge Industrialimproved the power management system of theVenator Armourthanks to Spartan feedback.
[17]A new variant of theM12G1 LAAVwhich uses a newGauss weapon, was also first tested during the campaign.
[18]Fireteam Shadowalso tested out theGoblin Armorduring the campaign.
