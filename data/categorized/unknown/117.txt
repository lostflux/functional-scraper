This includes, for example, foundation.mozilla.org, bugzilla.mozilla.org, reps.mozilla.org, careers.mozilla.org, developers.mozilla.org, support.mozilla.org, addons.mozilla.org, and wiki.mozilla.org.

If you create an account on Mozilla Connect (platform powered byKhoros, which has its own privacy notice), your name, your avatar, your posts and replies and other information you share will be accessible to Mozilla and other community members. If you create a profile at people.mozilla.org, it will be accessible to Mozilla employees and Mozilla contributors. You can edit your profile data atProfile Settings. We sometimes use contributor information from sources (such as Bugzilla) in dashboards to visually share aggregated data on the Mozilla community. An example ishttps://wiki.mozilla.org/Contribute/Dashboards. If possible, we try to minimize contact information that is publicly displayed.
