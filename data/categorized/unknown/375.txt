Enrollment:We'll take attendance at the beginning of semester and enroll based on qualifications, with graduate students taking precedence. For undergraduates, we'll generally require an A or A+ in CS188 and/or CS189, preferably both, as well as a strong math background. Students with exceptional technical accomplishments may also be considered. If there are too many interested students, we may ask for a short essay; the goal is to have a highly interactive class with a lot of discussion, and we cannot do that if there are too many students.
Subject matterTuring, Wiener, Minsky, and others have noted that making good use of highly intelligent machines requires ensuring that the objectives of such machines are well aligned with those of humans. As we diversify and amplify the cognitive abilities of machine intelligences, a long-term control problem arises for society: by what mathematical and engineering principles can we maintain sufficient control, indefinitely, over entities substantially more intelligent, and in that sense more powerful, than humans? Is there any formal solution one could offer, before the deployment of powerful machine intelligences, to guarantee the safety of such systems for humanity?This course will examine a variety of specific problems that could play into such a solution, many of which will have present-day industrial analogues. Special care will be taken to notice problems thatmight nothave present-day analogues, to prepare students for anticipating future gaps in the theory and practice of AGI safety and control. With an eye toward the eventual social and economic demand for formal guarantees of safety for AGI-level systems, this exploratory, interdisciplinary, seminar-style class will cover papers from artificial intelligence, machine learning, cognitive science, political science, and other discplines concerned with modelling and control of complex systems.
