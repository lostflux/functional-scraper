Materials DiscoveryIt can take over 10 years to come up with new materials. At IBM Research, we’re looking to accelerate the discovery process using new AI methods, robotics, the hybrid cloud, and quantum computers. Our goal is to unlock new properties and materials to address global challenges in years not decades.
Our workComputer simulations identify new ways to boost the skin’s natural protectorsHow to use AI to discover new drugs and materials with limited dataWhat are generative AI models?Machine learning is helping harness the power of enzymes for greener chemistryAccelerating molecular optimization with AIThe first atomic-resolution images of extraterrestrial moleculesTools + codeRoboRXN for ChemistryA unique tool for digital chemistry. Language models based on transformers can predict the most likely outcome of a chemical reaction and perform retrosynthetic analysis. RoboRXN can also program hardware to produce a molecule in a remotely accessible, autonomous chemical laboratory.
IBM Molecule Generation ExperienceAn AI-driven molecular inverse-design platform, which automatically designs brand new molecular structures rapidly and diversely.
RXNmapperA chemically agnostic attention-guided reaction mapper.
Deep Search Knowledge Graph of COVID-19 LiteratureIBM is providing free access to its COVID-19 Knowledge Graph, which is part of its Corpus Processing Service. This knowledge graph integrates COVID-19 data from various sources.
CIRCACIRCA enables easy search, visualization, and flexible export options of chemically-annotated data from publicly available patents and other data sources.
PublicationsProject PhotoresistWe used our accelerated discovery process to identify and synthesize a novel photoacid generator in less than a year — far quicker than it usually takes.
