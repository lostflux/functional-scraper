[2]ContentsPlotSections I to IIIHalo: The Floodtakes place between September 19,2552and September 23,2552. It is based on the gameHalo: Combat Evolved.
It begins as theUNSCcruiserUNSCPillar of Autumnis exiting slipspace (randomized vector due to theCole Protocol) after retreating from the fallen military base atReach.
Cortana's exit vector led the ship to a system found when she had decrypted Forerunner glyphs found byJohn-117onSigma Octanus IV. When thePillar of Autumndrops out of slipspace, she encounters a massive ring-world in orbit aroundThreshold, a gas giant. This world is calledInstallation 04, also known as Alpha Halo.
In the system there is ahostofCovenantShips, who notice the lone ship. AProphetforbids the fleet to fire on thePillar of Autumn, for fear of damaging the ring. Instead, the Covenant are willing to sacrifice more lives in order to board and capture the ship rather than blasting the ship to pieces. As a result of this, thePillar of Autumnand her crew are able to destroy four Covenant ships, but not without being further crippled from the Covenant onslaught. Meanwhile, technicians on theAutumnare preparing for battle and thawing out a single soldier from cryogenic sleep, presumably the lastSPARTAN-IIknown asJohn-117.
The Covenant proceed to take out theAutumn'sdefenses and board the ship. Deprived of defensive options, theAutumn'scaptain,Jacob Keyes, initiates theCole Protocoland tells the crew to abandon the ship. John-117 is entrusted with the AICortana; given the wealth of tactical information theAIcontains, (force deployment, weapons research, and the location of Earth) Keyes cannot allow Cortana to fall into Covenant hands. John fights through the Covenant invaders, reaches the last remaining lifeboat, and heads to the surface of the ringworld known asHalo. At the same time, a special contingent ofOrbital Drop Shock Troopers, or ODSTs, leave theAutumnviaHuman Entry Vehicles. On the ground, the ODST Commander,Major Antonio Silvaand his second-in-command,Melissa McKay, prepare to establish a ground base from where the human forces will launch their guerrilla resistance against the Covenant. Silva is aided by a Class C Military AI namedWellsley, after the Duke of Wellington, who advises them to capture a high butte.
Meanwhile, a CovenantUnggoynamedYayapleads his squad into thePillar of Autumn. Extremely cautious and cowardly by nature, Yayap and his team decide to rescue a Covenant Special OperationsSangheiliwounded by John-117, rather than fight the humans. The five small aliens drag the black-armored Sangheili back to their craft and escape the deterioratingAutumnas it plunges towards the Ringworld's atmosphere.
AnOssoonaby the name of Isna 'Nosolee manages to survive usingactive camouflageto board Keyes' lifeboat after tracking him down in an attempt to take him hostage. However, the Captain sees him and shoots him with a Corporal's M6D pistol. Isna's corpse later allows the Covenant to realize that they should capture Keyes. Keyes and his crew are forced to evade Covenant forces after they crash ontoHalo. Finally, they are betrayed byEnsign Ellen Dowski. Consequently, everyone, including the Ensign, is executed, save the Captain, who is captured for interrogation aboard theTruth and Reconciliation.
John-117 lands on Halo and helps rescue Marines from their lifeboats, while the ODSTs secureAlpha Baseafter a clash with Covenant forces. Yayap is rewarded for his rescue of the Sangheili,Zuka 'Zamamee, with a terribly dangerous assignment as the Sangheili's assistant.
John-117 and a squad of Marines board theTruth and Reconciliation, rescuing the Captain. Keyes has learned that the ringworld they are on has vast significance to the Covenant (they believe that "Halo," as they call the ring, is a weapon of unimaginable power). Escaping from the Covenant cruiser, Keyes gives John-117 the mission of finding the Control Room of Halo before the Covenant does. Meanwhile, Zuka ’Zamamee and Yayap are given permission to hunt for John-117, but fail in their attempts. Meanwhile,LieutenantMcKayand her company assault the now Covenant-controlled UNSCPillar of Autumnfor supplies and vehicles.
Keyes, along with a squad of Marines and Sergeant Johnson, are dropped into a swamp in an effort to discover a weapons cache. The Marines took prisoner a disillusioned Sangheili named 'Qualomee, who claimed to be delivering a shipment of weapons to a force guarding the structure. Pushing deep into a mysterious structure, the squad finds something unlike anything they have seen before - dead Covenant freakishly ripped open and scattered about. In a locked room, the squad discovers the cause of the fatalities - theFlood. These bulbous aliens attempt to latch themselves onto the Marines, and despite being fragile, the sheer number of the creatures overwhelm all the soldiers, tapping into their nervous systems and taking over their bodies. One soldier, PrivateWallace Jenkins, is left still semi-conscious and painfully aware of his predicament. He has a limited ability to control his movement or actions, because the infection form was weakened from the hibernation.
Sections IV and VJohn-117andCortanadiscover the location of theControl Room. John then inserts Cortana into Halo's computer network. However, Cortana realizes that the ring isn't a weapon as they understood at all. However, before John can press her with questions, Cortana tells John-117 to find the Captain, unaware that they are too late.
John-117is dropped alone into the swamp where Keyes disappeared. Heading into the same structure, John-117 follows the subterranean passages down to the same room where Keyes and his men were attacked. He discovers their horrible fate through a recording from PFC Wallace Jenkins' helmet cam, and fights his way to the surface. There, he meets up with Marines and heads to a tower for evac. Suddenly, John is teleported away from the swamp by Halo's resident AI,343 Guilty Spark. John-117 is informed that the creatures he has encountered are called theFlood, a virulent parasite that infects its enemies to produce more of itself. Guilty Spark wishes to activate Halo's defenses to wipe out the Flood, but needs John-117's help in recovering the "Index" to the installation, which allows the activation of the ring. Fighting more and moreFlood, John recovers the Index and is teleported back to Halo's control room.
Meanwhile, theUNSCforces ofAlpha Baseare forced to defend themselves from a surprise attack by Covenant forces who were attempting to kill John-117, unaware that he was absent. After the failed attack, UNSC forces attempted to ambush a Covenant recovery team, but were interrupted by a Flood attack. Jenkins attempted to commit suicide by throwing himself into the line of fire, but was instead captured.
Back in the Control Room, Guilty Spark gives John-117 theIndexto activate Halo, but is stopped by the furious Cortana. Cortana explains that Halo is a weapon, but it doesn't kill the Flood - it kills their food, meaning humans, Covenant, and any other sentient life in the galaxy. Realizing that they have to stop Guilty Spark from activating Halo, Cortana and John-117 decide to destroy Halo by detonating the crash-landedPillar of Autumn'sfusion reactors. In order to do this, they need Captain Keyes' neural implants to activate the countdown. In order to slow Guilty Spark's progress, the pair overload three generators that amplify Halo's weapon. In order to fire Halo, they would have to be repaired. Cortana discovers the Captain is still alive, held prisoner once again aboard theTruth and Reconciliation, now in the hands of the Flood who are trying to escape Halo with the ship. John fights Covenant and Flood to the Captain, but finds out he is too late; the Captain, after successfully resisting an interrogation by the Flood, was being transformed into a proto-Gravemind. John retrieves the implants and leaves theTruth and Reconciliationfor thePillar Of Autumn.
Section VIWhile John and Cortana head to theAutumn,Alpha Baseis evacuated. Silva decides to retake theTruth and Reconciliationand pilot the ship away in order to avoid being on Halo when theAutumnblows. The ship is taken successfully, but McKay realizes that Silva is blinded by the thought of promotion and glory to the danger of theFlood; ignoring Wellsley's objections, he fails to realize that if even one Flood specimen escaped containment onEarth, the entire planet could fall. An engineer notifies McKay of a vital power line (should it be severed, the unregulated energy would destroy the ship). Jenkins, who is infected but still coherent, attempts to destroy the line, but falls short. Realizing that the destruction of the Flood is far more important then Silva's promotion, McKay cuts the cable by activating a frag grenade, sending theTruth and Reconciliationcrashing into Halo, nose first, killing everything aboard.
At the wreckedAutumnJohn-117 is forced to destabilize the fusion reactors manually as 343 Guilty Spark and his roboticSentinelstry to stop them. On the way to the Engine Room, John-117 is nearly infected by the Flood, but Cortana saves him. Once the countdown until detonation has begun, Cortana radios for dropship evacuation, but the transport is shot down by Covenant aircraft. A disgruntled Zuka 'Zamamee attempts to ambush John, but is killed by a hail of grenades. Cortana directs John to aLongsword Interceptorstill docked in thePillar of Autumnhangar. Gunning the engines, John and Cortana escape the ring just as theAutumnexplodes, ending the threat of theFlood. Cortana scans for survivors and realizes that they are seemingly the only two who have survived. Cortana tells John-117 that the fight is finished, to which John replies, "No, the Covenant is still out there, and Earth is at risk. We're just getting started.
"CharactersUNSCCovenantAIsReceptionReception forHalo: The Floodwas generally mixed, with most criticism about Dietz's characterization ofJohn-117. Some commented on the fact that the storyline did not separate itself from the game too well, which made it less exciting, as it was made more predictable.
[3]It was also said that the book was like the game in that it "ground down to meaningless repetition of gunning down bad guys," saying that the repetition of it would bore readers.
[4]Another commented that Dietz's writing was not as good as Nylund's, saying it was detailed, but redundant.
[5]However, others praised it, saying "it fulfills its duty and elaborates on the major plot points and subtleties in ways the game never could."[6]TriviaGallerySourcesFan FeedExplore propertiesFollow UsOverviewCommunityAdvertiseFandom Apps
