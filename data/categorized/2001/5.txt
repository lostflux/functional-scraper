It was released for the originalXboxgame console on November 15, 2001, and is backward compatible with theXbox 360by downloading a free code patch onXbox Live. It was also released asHalo PCfor PC and Mac in2003. Additionally, it is one of the most popular video games of all time for the original Xbox with five million copies sold, a figure rivaled only by its sequelHalo 2, which achieved eight million sales.
[1]Halo: Combat Evolvedhas been made available as an Xbox Original game title for the Xbox 360 since December 4, 2007 for download onXbox Live Marketplacefor 1200 Microsoft Points. In June 2012, the game's price was lowered to 800 Microsoft Points.
[2]A 10th year edition of the game was released for the Xbox 360 calledHalo: Combat Evolved Anniversaryon November 15, 2011, precisely 10 years after the original game, and the original Xbox, were released.
ContentsCampaignHalo's storyline is linear, presented through cut-scenes. There is only one ending. The Xbox version ofHalo: Combat Evolvedallows one player to play the campaign alone, as well as two players to play cooperatively in split screen. ThePC version ofHalo: Combat Evolvedallows only one player to play through the campaign.
TheHalo: Combat EvolvedCampaign consists of 10 levels:SummaryUNSCPillar of Autumnemerges fromSlipspaceto find a huge ring — a "Halo" floating in space. The main character,Master Chief Petty OfficerJohn-117, is aboard thePillar of Autumnwhen the ship comes under attack by theCovenant, an alliance of aliens and the mortal enemies of humanity. John-117 evacuates the doomed ship for the surface of Halo to protect theAutumn'sartificial intelligence,Cortana. She carries highly sensitive military information, which would prove disastrous if she were captured by the Covenant. With the UNSC Marines by his side, Cortana providing direction, and his assault rifle ready and loaded, John-117 sets to finding out the mysteries of Halo and defeating the Covenant.
PlotThe first few levels of the game deal with an attempt to reach Halo'sControl Roomto uncover its purpose. It is soon discovered that during an attempt to take control of a research facility, both human and Covenant forces have accidentally released something: theFlood, as a result of the battle. The Flood is a parasitic race which received their name because of the way they swarm over all resistance. Free for the first time in thousands of years, the Flood sweeps across Halo, devastating Human and Covenant forces alike. The release of theFloodprompts343 Guilty Spark, the eccentricForerunnerartificial intelligence, to activate Halo's defense systems. Most obvious among these are theSentinels, flying robots equipped with beam projectors, but Halo's actual weapon is much more subtle and far more dangerous. Halo can fire a pulse that will wipe out all sentient life in a 25,000 light year radius. As sentient life is the Flood's food, the Flood will not be able to survive, and will therefore perish. Though theInstallationonly has a maximum effective radius of 25,000 light years, the pulse will trigger other installations as well. This system is designed to stop the Flood from spreading through the universe if they escape confinement from Halo, by starving the Flood of any life source large enough to sustain them. This is the only possible solution to the destructive parasite.
Naturally, this would wipe out Humanity as well as the Covenant, and so the final levels of the game revolve around John's attempt to destroy Halo before it fires.
The game leaves the story open to further developments, with the revelation that there are several Halo ring worlds in the galaxy, due to Halo being numbered Installation 04 by 343 Guilty Spark, the Monitor of the Installation. It is revealed later in Halo 2 that there were seven Halos before Installation 04's destruction.
BackstoryThe events which transpire inHalo's gameplay must be understood in the context of its backstory, created by Bungie and elaborated in several novels written after the release of the game. Noteworthy is its use of the oft-used battle between monoculture radicalism and free culturalism. Also present, although less pronounced, is the likewise popular theme of blind religion (Covenant) versus free-thought secularism (UNSC). A summary of this back story is presented below.
Early conflicts2160-2200: This is a period of brutal unrest in Human history in whichNational governmentsand break-off factions fight for control of Earth and its colonies.
As overpopulation and unrest mounted onEarth, a number of new political movements were formed including the neo-communistKoslovics, led by Vladimir Koslov, and the neo-fascistFriedenbased on theJovian Moons, which attacked theUN Colonial Adviserson one of the moons. UN-sponsored military forces began a pattern of massive build-ups which culminated in theJovian Moons campaign, theRainforest Warsand the firstInterplanetary War. After the successfulMarine attack on Mars, recruitment drives and propaganda tactics strongly bolstered UNSC forces. They defeated the Koslovics and the Frieden on Earth and crushed their remnants throughout the Solar System. Both factions were defeated in the face of massive, unified UN military.
Human colonization of the Orion ArmIn the year 2291, theUNSCsuccessfully developed humanity's firstSlipspacedrive, theShaw-Fujikawa Translight Engine. For the first time in history, the rapid colonization of other worlds was made possible. By 2390, 210 worlds had been occupied by humans, and were being activelyterraformedto suit man's needs. These worlds were to become known as theInner colonies. By 2490, the UNSC's fledgling interstellar empire had expanded to over 800 planets throughout theOrion Armof theMilky Way galaxy. During this period, the planetReachbecame the headquarters of the UNSC military, and was destined to become the most heavily fortified world under human control.
The SPARTAN-II ProjectIn 2517, several years before contact with the Covenant, the UNSC military embarked on a secret project to create a group of super soldiers that would deal with occasional unrest in the Colonies. Codenamed SPARTANs, thesegenetically enhancedtroops were trained from the age of 6 into a life of battle, and became a great asset against the Covenant. While humans suffered defeat after defeat in space, they could almost always prevail with the help of the SPARTANs in ground engagements. The main character ofHalo's gameplay, John-117, is a veteran SPARTAN of the SPARTAN-II project after an unfortunate failure of thefirst SPARTAN program(code name Orion). All SPARTAN-IIs were given special armor designatedMjolnir, which can increase their strength and speed. They were the only ones who could wear it as those without physical augmentation would not be able to withstand the reaction times of the armor and die.
Fall of the Outer ColoniesAfterfirst contactwith the Covenant was made on the colony ofHarvestin2525, a series of brutal engagements followed.
AdmiralPreston Cole'sfleetmanaged avictory at Harvest, but at a high cost - two thirds of his ships were destroyed. Despite significant tactical brilliance on the part of Human commanders, Covenant technology guaranteed a four to one kill/loss ratio in most space battles. One by one, the Outer Colonies fell below the onslaught, and by2535, virtually all had been destroyed.
Fall of ReachBy 2552, the Covenant had destroyed many of Humanity's Inner colonies. In a move of desperation, UNSC orders a secret plan to capture a Covenant ship using a SPARTAN task force and find the coordinates of their home planet. All of the Spartans except three are chosen for this mission, and, led by John-117, board a specially outfitted ship known as thePillar of Autumn(under the command of CaptainJacob Keyes). This plan, however, is interrupted when the Covenant launch a surprise attack on the fortress world of Reach.
During this battle, Reach is overrun and the human fleet is obliterated. Worse still, John-117 thinks that all of the SPARTANs but himself are killed on the surface of the planet. The (supposedly) last remaining Spartan, John-117, escapes with thePillar of Autumn. In accordance with theCole Protocol, theAutumnmakes a blind Slipspace jump, and emerges in the vicinity of an unexplored and remarkable world.
Arrival at HaloThePillar of Autumnexits Slipspace to find a mysterious ring shaped space station orbiting agas giant. The ring, quickly named "Halo," is obviously artificial. A Covenantfleet, however, is also present, and a subsequent battle heavily damages theAutumn. Captain Keyes initiates the Cole protocol 2 - all records of Earth's location are erased, the shipboard AI Cortana is given to John-117 to protect from the Covenant, and theAutumnis crash landed onto Halo. Cortana leaves theAutumnwith John-117 in aBumblebee escape podwhich also crash lands on Halo.
Game play begins in earnest with John-117's escape from theAutumn, and continues upon landing. The player will soon discover the origins and purpose of this world - and uncover a threat that forces even the Covenant into retreat.
As a literary side note, the ring, "Halo," borrows heavily from theRingworldofLarry Nivenand theCulture OrbitalsofIain M. Banks.

SummaryHalo's gameplay was characterized by several features which set it apart from less acclaimed first-person shooter games of its time.
Movement inHalois similar to other first-person shooters, allowing the player to move forwards, backwards, and strafe left and right independently of their aim. On the Xbox, moving and aiming are normally separated between the two analogue sticks; and on thePC, between the mouse and the keyboard.
Haloalso allows the player to crouch and jump, although jumping from a high ledge will often result in death, or at least major fall damage. Damage from falling can be reduced or negated entirely with a well-timed crouch right as one lands. Additionally, if the player crouches at the peak of his jump he will be able to land on something slightly taller than if he were to jump without crouching. Also, if the player is jumping from a cliff he can make sure he is touching the wall periodically while he is falling. This will count as if he is touching floor, and every time the player touches the wall, the damage counter goes to zero. However, there is no visible damage counter during gameplay.
Levels of difficultyThere are short summaries that describe the difficulties in Halo: Combat Evolved.
EnemiesThe A.I. inHalowas superior to many other games at the time because the A.I. was sophisticated enough to attack other enemies in the vicinity, not just John-117. If there is another faction in the area, the A.I. will engage it in the same way as they would fight John-117.
Three factions of enemies are encountered on Halo:AlliesWeaponsAll usable weapons in Halo: Combat Evolved belong to either theCovenantor theUNSC. The player can carry two weapons and up to 8 grenades (Four Fragmentation Grenades and Four Plasma Grenades).
Covenant weapons are better suited for reducing shields and typically fire slower than human weapons. With the exception of the Needler, they do not require ammunition or reloading. Instead, each weapon comes with its own battery. Once the battery is depleted the weapon must be discarded. Covenant weapons can also overheat (except the Needler) if fired for too long, after which they must be given time to cool down before they can be used again. There are a total of five Covenant weapons in the Campaign, three of which are usable by the player: thePlasma Pistol,Plasma Rifle, and theNeedler. The two weapons the player can't use are theEnergy Sword, which destabilizes after you kill the Sangheili using it, and theFuel Rod Gun, which explodes after you kill the enemy using it. There are two additional weapons in the multiplayer mode of the PC version only, theFuel Rod GunandFlamethrower. A plasma based weapon of the same type but with greater charge than the player's current one will appear as a swappable weapon. If the weapon has lesser charge, it is not swappable until the player's current charge falls low enough. Needlers automatically collect any ammunition from other needlers the player moves over. Needlers can also use some very rare individual packs of projectiles.
Human weapons, on the other hand, require ammunition and constant reloading. They are better suited for reducing health and do not overheat. However, on the Easy and Normal difficulty settings the difference is often negligible. There are five human weapons (not counting Fragmentation Grenades) usable in the Campaign and six in theMultiplayerof the Halo PC.
UNSC weaponsCovenant weaponsVehiclesHalo CE Scorpion Tank on one of Halo's most celebrated Multiplayer maps, Blood GulchA Warthog battles with a Ghost.
The vehicles available to the player in this game are listed below:Several vehicles are not controllable by the player, like the UNSCPelican Dropship, the CovenantSpiritdropship, and the CovenantWraith Mortar Tank. The Wraith requires ballistic aiming, firing large Plasma Bombs in arcs towards its enemies, similar to artillery. These bombs, if they score a direct hit, will often destroy vehicles or kill a Spartan if he/she is not equipped with anOvershield. Wraiths can be destroyed with explosive weapons such as theScorpion's Main Cannon and therocket launcher.
Also, it is very easy to splatter enemies in Halo: Combat Evolved because the game's physics engine cannot discern between a fast and slow-moving vehicle, thus making it so that a slight touch, even by accident, will kill it. This is especially frustrating on the level "The Silent Cartographer"'s LZ, as Marines tend to dive underneath the level's many Warthogs, and in multiplayer, since the player can easily be killed by unoccupied vehicles.
EnvironmentsHalofeatures a wide variety of environments including human and Covenant star ships, ancient buildings onHaloitself, and expansive outdoor climates. The first level,Pillar of Autumn, is fought entirely on the human star ship of the same name. The next level,Halo, takes place in a temperate highland climate with open-air Forerunner structures scattered about. This level also contains the famous "Blue Beam Towers."Truth and Reconciliationbegins in a rocky desert, but the setting changes to the titular Covenant cruiser about one-third of the way through.
The Silent Cartographeroccurs on a tropical island, with substantial combat both outdoors and inside futuristic Forerunner installations.
Assault on the Control Roomtakes place in a snowy, icy area of towering cliffs and underground tunnels as well as high-tech suspension bridges and oft-repeated Forerunner structures built into and through cliff walls.
343 Guilty Sparkis a significant departure from these majestic environments, with combat in gloomy, exotic swamps and equally gloomy underground complexes that host the player's introduction to the Flood. The player is then teleported to the second of three entirely indoor levels,The Library, encountering repetitive, foreboding hallways and massive elevators. John-117 returns to the snowy climate of Assault on the Control Room forTwo Betrayals, visiting almost no new areas but, interestingly, traveling in the opposite direction.
Keyesoccurs in the same rocky deserts and the same Covenant ship from Truth and Reconciliation, albeit now heavily damaged, but this time the Flood are present in huge numbers. Finally,The Mawis set on the Pillar of Autumn with three major differences: the presence of the Flood, the heavy structural damage, and access to the Engineering section and service corridors of the ship, which were previously off-limits. In total, six of the ten levels feature a substantial amount of combat outdoors.
MultiplayerUp to four players can play together using the same-console split screen mode. It is also possible for up to 16 players to play together in oneHalogame over alocal area network, using Xbox and/or Xbox 360 consoles that have been connected through anEthernethub, or via Xbox Connect, which is a way of tunneling a connection via a PC. The game's seamless support for this type of play, and a few large maps that can accommodate up to 16 combatants, is a first for console games. Since the game was released before the launch of Xbox Live, mainstream online play was not available for this title. ThePCversion ofHalo: Combat Evolvedofficially adds online play, also new vehicles (BansheeandRocket Warthog), weapons (Fuel Rod GunandFlamethrower) and maps (see list below) for multiplayer. The PC version ofHalo: Combat Evolveddoes not support split screen multiplayer.
Multiplayer mapsArenaBig Team BattleDamage systemPower upsThere are three power ups available inHalo:Retail EditionsComparisonStandard EditionThe standard edition of the game includes the disk and manual, and has remained unchanged since the game's release. This edition has ceased production, along with theoriginal Xboxitself.
Classics EditionDue to its huge retail success,Halo: CEreceived a Xbox Classics edition. This version is essentially identical to the standard edition, except with a commemorative box art. It was available for a reduced price,[citation needed]but has now stopped production.
Platinum Hits EditionAgain, due to its record-breaking sale numbers, a Platinum Hits edition ofHalo: CEwas produced. This version, like the Classics Version, contains the same content as the standard edition, but with a different box art. This version is no longer in production.
Marketing promotions and releaseDemonstrationIn 2000 at E3, Bungie showed off a trailer of the upcoming game to the public. This trailer featured Marines along with John-117 scouting out a Forerunner structure and the Covenant fighting them. During this trailer there was still no active AI so all the Covenant was actually controlled by Bungie. This trailer was before the conversion to the Xbox as an FPS.
Viral campaignCortana in Halo: Combat EvolvedTheCortana Lettersare a series of cryptic emails from "cortana@bungie.com," sent to a very prominentMarathonsitebefore the release of the game. At the time, it was not known whoCortanawas, and her emails offered a small glimpse of theHaloTrilogy plot. The letters were supposedly authored by the formerBungieemployeeNathan Bitner.
It should be noted that the Cortana Letters were sent while the game was still in production, and Cortana is greatly out of character. As such, these letters may currently offer little insight into the plot. Although Cortana does reference the first letter inHalo 3, Bungie has said the material of the letters is only to be considered canon when used in currentHalomaterial.
ReceptionThe box art forHalo: Combat Evolvedon PC.
