The United States has too many low-quality, low-wage jobs. Every country has its share, but those in the United States are especially poorly paid and often without benefits. Meanwhile, overall productivity increases steadily and new technology has transformed large parts of the economy, enhancing the skills and paychecks of higher-paid knowledge workers. What's wrong with this picture? Why have so many workers benefited so little from decades of growth?The Work of the Futureshows that technology is neither the problem nor the solution. We can build better jobs if we create institutions that leverage technological innovation and also support workers though long cycles of technological transformation.
Building on findings from the multiyear MIT Task Force on the Work of the Future, the book argues that we must foster institutional innovations that complement technological change. Skills programs that emphasize work-based and hybrid learning (in person and online), for example, empower workers to become and remain productive in a continuously evolving workplace. Industries fueled by new technology that augments workers can supply good jobs, and federal investment in R&D can help make these industries worker-friendly. We must act to ensure that the labor market of the future offers benefits, opportunity, and a measure of economic security to all.

The expert authors ofThe Work of the Futureprovide tomorrow's leaders with crucial insights to develop a creative vision for the future—and ensure technology drives opportunity in the years to come.”Eric SchmidtCofounder, Schmidt Futures; former CEO and Chairman, Google“Work is changing in every industry and for every worker in some way.

Leaders from every realm—business, government, education, and social organizations—have much to learn from this book!”Ginni M. Romettyformer Chairman, President, and CEO, IBM“The Work of the Futurechallenges us to think deeply and critically about the crisis facing hard-working Americans and shows how a more secure and stable future is a matter of choice, not fate. An accessible but well-researched antidote to much of today's economic orthodoxy.”David M.
