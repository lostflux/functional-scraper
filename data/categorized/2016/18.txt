We are pleased to announce the selected PhD projects for 2016.
This year we received 40 eligible project proposals, which we assessed via a two-stage review process. During Stage 1, a panel of Microsoft Researchers determined whether the proposed project met the basic selection criteria, including relevance to topics that are being researched at Microsoft Research Cambridge.
 Those proposals that advanced to Stage 2 were then evaluated by a board of 89 researchers from Microsoft Research Laboratories, who provided detailed feedback.
MICROSOFT RESEARCH PODCAST Intern Insights: Dr. Madeleine Daepp with Jennifer Scurrell and Alejandro Cuevas In this episode, PhD students Jennifer Scurrell and Alejandro Cuevas talk to Senior Researcher Dr. Madeleine Daepp.
 They discuss the internship culture at Microsoft Research, from opportunities to connect with researchers to the teamwork they say helped make it possible for them to succeed, and the impact they hope to have with their work.

These include six proposals that relate to the Joint Initiative with University College London and the Joint Initiative in Informatics with Edinburgh University.
The seventeen projects are located in six countries across Europe (Austria, Germany, Sweden and the United Kingdom) and represent a variety of research areas, including computational biology, machine learning, health science, geo and environmental science, and computer science. Applicants, who are PhD supervisors, collaborate with an assigned Microsoft Research co-supervisor to support a PhD student for up to three years as he or she carries out the proposed research project. Supervisors are actively recruiting graduate students for these PhD projects; candidate selection should be complete by March 2017.
Below is a list of the selected projects, including the PhD supervisor and the institution: Bit-level Accurate Reasoning and Interpolation Georg Weissenbacher, TU Wien, Austria Continuous Listening Services: Leveraging Sociological Understandings of Talk for Continuous Agent Input Barry Brown, University of Stockholm, Sweden Computational Design of Nonlinear Functions using Nucleic Acids Vishwesh Kulkarni, University of Warwick, UK Data-Efficient Reinforcement Learning from Image Pixels Marc Deisenroth, Imperial College London, UK Learning to Infer in Graphical Models and Probabilistic Programmes Yee Whye The, University of Oxford Lightweight Concurrency Modelling Mike Dodds, University of York, UK Meaningful Metadata: The Things I Wish I Knew Wendy Moncur, University of Dundee, UK Medical Image Analysis in the Cloud: Application to Early Stage Cancer Detection Ben Glocker, Imperial College London, UK Modelling the Survival and Proliferation of Cancer Cells in Metastasis Benjamin Hall, University of Cambridge, UK Smart Molecular Biosensors: Design Principles and Foundational Technologies James Ajioka, University of Cambridge, UK Towards total Immersion: Accurate Reconstruction of Lights, Materials and 3D Geometry from RGB, Depth and Motion Andreas Geiger, Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems, Tübingen, Germany Joint Initiative with University College London: Conversational Search: Mathematical modelling and Applications Jun Wang Estimating the Credibility of Health Information on the Web Ingemar Cox A Highly Scalable Optical Switch Fabric for Data Centre Networks Benn Thomsen Joint Initiative with Informatics with University of Edinburgh: Dense Visual Tracking for Active Manipulation Maurice Fallon Rack-Scale Interconnect Fabrics for Disaggregated Memory Boris Grot Reducing the Annotation Tax of Programming Language Types using Machine Learning and Big Code Charles Sutton Thank you to all who applied this year.
We look forward to receiving equally stimulating project proposals for next year’s PhD scholarships. Mark your calendar for September 1, 2016, when the submission tool for the 2017 applications will open.
