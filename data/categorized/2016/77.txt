Mindfulness InterventionsAnnual Review of PsychologyVol. 68:491-516 (Volume publication date January 2017)First published online as a Review in Advance on September 28, 2016https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-psych-042716-051139J. David CreswellDepartment of Psychology, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15213; email:[email protected]AbstractMindfulness interventions aim to foster greater attention to and awareness of present moment experience. There has been a dramatic increase in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of mindfulness interventions over the past two decades. This article evaluates the growing evidence of mindfulness intervention RCTs by reviewing and discussing (a) the effects of mindfulness interventions on health, cognitive, affective, and interpersonal outcomes; (b) evidence-based applications of mindfulness interventions to new settings and populations (e.g., the workplace, military, schools); (c) psychological and neurobiological mechanisms of mindfulness interventions; (d) mindfulness intervention dosing considerations; and (e) potential risks of mindfulness interventions. Methodologically rigorous RCTs have demonstrated that mindfulness interventions improve outcomes in multiple domains (e.g., chronic pain, depression relapse, addiction). Discussion focuses on opportunities and challenges for mindfulness intervention research and on community applications.

MaccobyVol. 51, 2000AbstractThere is clear evidence that parents can and do influence children. There is equally clear evidence that children’s genetic makeup affects their own behavioral characteristics, and also influences the way they are treated by their parents. Twin and ...

KassamVol. 66, 2015AbstractA revolution in the science of emotion has emerged in recent decades, with the potential to create a paradigm shift in decision theories. The research reveals that emotions constitute potent, pervasive, predictable, sometimes harmful and sometimes ...

Executive FunctionsAdele DiamondVol. 64, 2013AbstractExecutive functions (EFs) make possible mentally playing with ideas; taking the time to think before acting; meeting novel, unanticipated challenges; resisting temptations; and staying focused. Core EFs are inhibition [response inhibition (self-control—...

Working Memory: Theories, Models, and ControversiesAlan BaddeleyVol. 63, 2012AbstractI present an account of the origins and development of the multicomponent approach to working memory, making a distinction between the overall theoretical framework, which has remained relatively stable, and the attempts to build more specific models ...

Learning from ErrorsJanet MetcalfeVol. 68, 2017AbstractAlthough error avoidance during learning appears to be the rule in American classrooms, laboratory studies suggest that it may be a counterproductive strategy, at least for neurologically typical students. Experimental investigations indicate that ...
