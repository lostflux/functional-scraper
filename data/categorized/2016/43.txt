2016 Microsoft Research PhD Scholarship Projects AnnouncedPublishedFebruary 12, 2016Research AreaByDaron Green, Director, Microsoft ResearchEvery year since 2004, theMicrosoft Research PhD Scholarship Programmehas awarded scholarships to fund PhD students’ work on selected projects in the Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) region. We are pleased to announce the selected PhD projects for 2016.
This year we received 40 eligible project proposals, which we assessed via a two-stage review process. During Stage 1, a panel of Microsoft Researchers determined whether the proposed project met the basic selection criteria, including relevance to topics that are being researched atMicrosoft Research Cambridge. Those proposals that advanced to Stage 2 were then evaluated by a board of 89 researchers from Microsoft Research Laboratories, who provided detailed feedback.

Ultimately, we selected seventeen projects to receive funding throughMicrosoft Researchstarting in the academic year 2016–2017. These include six proposals that relate to theJoint Initiative with University College Londonand theJoint Initiative in Informatics with Edinburgh University.
The seventeen projects are located in six countries across Europe (Austria, Germany, Sweden and the United Kingdom) and represent a variety of research areas, including computational biology, machine learning, health science, geo and environmental science, and computer science. Applicants, who are PhD supervisors, collaborate with an assigned Microsoft Research co-supervisor to support a PhD student for up to three years as he or she carries out the proposed research project. Supervisors are actively recruiting graduate students for these PhD projects; candidate selection should be complete by March 2017.
Below is a list of the selected projects, including the PhD supervisor and the institution:Joint Initiative with University College London:Joint Initiative with Informatics with University of Edinburgh:Thank you to all who applied this year.
We look forward to receiving equally stimulating project proposals for next year’s PhD scholarships. Mark your calendar for September 1, 2016, when the submission tool for the 2017 applications will open.
