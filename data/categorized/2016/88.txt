AdvertisementMagneto-aerotactic bacteria deliver drug-containing nanoliposomes to tumour hypoxic regionsNature Nanotechnologyvolume11,pages941–947 (2016)Cite this article23kAccesses539Citations685AltmetricMetricsdetailsSubjectsAbstractOxygen-depleted hypoxic regions in the tumour are generally resistant to therapies1. Although nanocarriers have been used to deliver drugs, the targeting ratios have been very low. Here, we show that the magneto-aerotactic migration behaviour2of magnetotactic bacteria3,Magnetococcus marinusstrain MC-1 (ref.
4), can be used to transport drug-loaded nanoliposomes into hypoxic regions of the tumour. In their natural environment, MC-1 cells, each containing a chain of magnetic iron-oxide nanocrystals5, tend to swim along local magnetic field lines and towards low oxygen concentrations6based on a two-state aerotactic sensing system2. We show that when MC-1 cells bearing covalently bound drug-containing nanoliposomes were injected near the tumour in severe combined immunodeficient beige mice and magnetically guided, up to 55% of MC-1 cells penetrated into hypoxic regions of HCT116 colorectal xenografts. Approximately 70 drug-loaded nanoliposomes were attached to each MC-1 cell. Our results suggest that harnessing swarms of microorganisms exhibiting magneto-aerotactic behaviour can significantly improve the therapeutic index of various nanocarriers in tumour hypoxic regions.

MainOxygen consumption by rapidly proliferative tumour cells results in less than∼0.7% O2-depleted tumour areas that are known as hypoxic regions7. The pharmaceutical nanocarriers currently in use, such as liposomes, micelles and polymeric nanoparticles, among others, generally fail to reach these hypoxic regions8. Combining the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect of nanocarriers with longer systemic circulation properties achieved following PEGylation has increased the targeting ratio, but still results in a very limited fraction of nanocarriers entering tumours. Because only 5% of the administered nanocarriers remain in the systemic circulation after 12 h, this ultimately results in only∼2% of the total administered dose being deposited in the tumour9.
The main targeting limitations of these nanocarriers are their reliance on the systemic circulation, the lack of a propelling force to penetrate the tumour beyond their diffusion limits10and the absence of a sensory-based displacement capability to target the hypoxic zones. Although robotic functionalities could correct for such deficiencies, scaling issues have prevented their integration into an artificial carrier. Harnessing a natural agent with the proper characteristics and functionalities has therefore been considered instead.
One example is theMagnetococcus marinusstrain MC-1. In their natural environment, MC-1 cells rely on geomagnetic-assisted aerotaxis (known as magneto-aerotaxis) to efficiently migrate to and maintain position at preferred low oxygen concentrations at the oxic–anoxic transition zone (OATZ).
Our hypothesis was that a similar OATZ present in the tumour interstitium between the angiogenic network (oxic) and the tumour necrotic (anoxic) zones could be exploited to enhance drug targeting to hypoxic regions using live MC-1 cells being guided by an external magnetic source. Indeed, unlike previous bacterial therapies11, minimizing systemic circulation of drug-loaded MC-1 cells can be achieved by initially guiding them (seeMethods, ‘Magnetotaxis directional control’) towards such OATZs where oxygen gradients can be detected by the bacteria. Magnetotaxis was prioritized over aerotaxis because, unlike hypoxic zones, the location of a tumour mass can generally be determined precisely.
Based on the Langevin function, the level of magnetotactic directional control (characterized by the alignment of the MC-1 membranous chain of Fe3O4nanoparticles known as magnetosomes12in the applied directional magnetic field) depends on the ratio of the interactive magnetic energy with the applied field to the thermal energy. Without a magnetic field, thermal forces associated with Brownian motion randomize the cell orientation unless the MC-1 detects an oxygen gradient in the tumour interstitium. We first used a three-dimensional targeting magnetic field slightly higher than the geomagnetic field to induce a stronger directional torque on the chain of magnetosomes13in order to penetrate the tumour from the peritumoral regions. This was followed by an MC-1 autonomous aerotactic directional phase when the bacteria penetrated the tumour. The physiological environments encountered by the MC-1 cells were different from those found along their natural migrating paths, so the experiments were aimed at assessing whether the MC-1 cells would effectively migrate towards the hypoxic zones following a peritumoral injection. More specifically, we questioned whether the spherical MC-1 cells (diameter of 1–2 µm) would be able to migrate through potential delivery routes such as the irregular and disorganized angiogenic network, the interstitial spaces and the intercellular openings of less than 2 µm between endothelial cells14within solid tumours.
The antibodies used for the detection of MC-1 receptors were custom made. Their specificity was demonstrated in this study using xenografts injected with either PBS or MC-1 (Fig. 1) and usingHelicobacter pylorias a negative control (Supplementary Fig. 1). To better visualize the hypoxic tumour regions and demonstrate co-localization of the bacteria, we injected a hypoxia-specific hydroxyprobe before tumour excision (seeMethods, ‘Staining of the hypoxic regions’). The results, illustrated inFig. 2a,b(and alsoSupplementary Fig. 2) clearly demonstrate co-staining of MC-1 bacteria (fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) staining,Supplementary Fig. 2a, panel c) and hypoxic regions labelled in brown (Supplementary Fig. 2apanels a and b; see also Methods: immunohistology staining). To further confirm the identity of the previously detected MC-1 cells in tumour sections (seeMethods, ‘Digitization of transverse tumour sections’), several sections were also analysed using electron microscopy (for details on sample preparation, seeMethods, ‘Transmission electron microscopy’). One representative section depicted inFig. 2d, shows magnetosomes inside an MC-1 cell.
a,b, To ascertain the specificity of MC-1 antibody, xenografts were injected with either MC-1 (a) or PBS (b).
c–f, An unrelated IgG isotype (6.6 µg ml–1) was used (c,d) together with polyclonal rabbit MC-1 antibody (e,f) on two adjacent sections of the same xenograft. In both cases, the reaction was revealed using either FITC (green) or Texas Red (red) secondary antibodies. Specific labelling could be observed only in the MC-1 injected xenografts incubated with MC-1 antibody. Control IgG was unable to identify MC-1. These results confirmed the specificity of the antibodies to detect MC-1 cells in tumours.
a,b, To determine the exact location of MC-1 with regard to the local oxygen tension in tissue, a hypoxyprobe-specific antibody labelled with biotin was used, where strands and islands of remaining hypoxic tumour tissue give a positive brownish reaction in the vicinity of necrotic areas, as illustrated inb.
c, The MC-1 antibodies specifically detect MC-1, which is visualized by staining with anti-rabbit FITC-labelled secondary antibodies (×10 and ×40). Inc, adjacent sections of the same xenografts were incubated with MC-1 antibody and a FITC-conjugated specific secondary antibody to label MC-1, thus confirming the presence of abundant bacteria in areas of lowered oxygen concentration (×10 and ×40 images of MC-1 FITC fluorescently labelled), and high-resolution images were acquired manually using a DP71 digital camera mounted on an Olympus BX61 motorized upright microscope with fluorescence (FITC/Texas Red (TXRED)/4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)).
d, Representative portion of a paraffin-embedded section reprocessed for transmission electron microscopy (TEM), which identifies the MC-1 bacteria according to their typical ultrastructural features including presence of magnetosomes. The representative pictures were selected from stained sections obtained using ten different tumours isolated from ten tumour-bearing mice collected in three independent experiments.
To investigate magnetically guided live MC-1 cells (for bacteria preparation before injection, seeMethods) in HCT116 xenografts (for details on the preparation of HCT116 tumour cells, seeMethods), 20 mice were peritumorally injected with∼5 × 107bacteria in 50 µl PBS solution. Two groups were assessed: an experimental group (group I), which was submitted to a 30 min directional magnetic field using a specially made platform (the magnetotaxis system,Fig. 3a), targeting the xenograft (Fig. 3b), and a control group (group II), which was not exposed to a magnetic field. The colour superimpositions inFig. 3show the MC-1 distributions in the xenografts of group I (Fig. 3c) or group II (Fig. 3d) mice. The results for both groups are shown in four transverse 5 × 5 mm2sections, 2, 4, 6 and 8 mm from the injection site in the magnetically targeted corridor passing through the centre of the tumour.
a, Magnetotaxis directional control system used to generate the magnetic field necessary to guide the MC-1 cells towards the xenograft.
b, MC-1 peritumoral injection into HCT116 tumour xenograft in mice and representation of the applied directional magnetic field used in this study to direct the bacteria towards the xenograft. The directional magnetic fieldBwas aligned towards the centre of the tumoral volume.
c,d, MC-1 average distribution in transverse tumour (n= 10) sections visualized by staining with anti-rabbit FITC-labelled secondary antibodies at 2, 4, 6 and 8 mm from the peritumoral injection site for group I (c) and group II (d). The results show not only a significant increase in the targeting ratios of magnetically guided MC-1 cells to non-magnetically guided MC-1 cells, but also a good distribution in the tumoral volume and more specifically in the tumour hypoxic regions. The higher populations of MC-1 cells in group I contribute in targeting all hypoxic regions in the tumour.
e, Standard deviation and average number of MC-1 cells in the transverse tumour sections in groups I and II. Statistical analysis was performed using unpaired Student'st-test. Significant difference was considered for **P< 0.01. The results clearly show a significant increase in MC-1 cells for group I in the tumoral volume where magnetotactic directional guidance was used prior to removing the magnetic field to enable aerotactic displacements of the MC-1 cells towards the hypoxic areas once inside the xenograft. Without magnetotactic directional guidance, only a smaller proportion of MC-1 cells, which randomly swam in the direction of the xenograft, could potentially be influenced by oxygen gradients in the tumoral tissues.
f, Summary of the total average numbers of injected and detected MC-1 cells for all tumours in groups I and II. Data are shown as mean + s.d. (n= 10 forc–f). Transverse tumour sections were scanned at ×40 magnification and the numbers of bacteria in the tumours were estimated using image-processing techniques (seeMethods, ‘MC-1 count’). The results show that a significant number of the peritumorally injected MC-1 cells being magnetically guided using a relatively simple static directional magnetic field were able to penetrate the xenograft, unlike the case for bacteria that were not guided into the tumour. These results probably represent a simplified case scenario, as many other more sophisticated modulated directional magnetic fields could be investigated to increase further the targeting ratios achieved in this study.
The corresponding total numbers of MC-1 cells in each section along the central longitudinal axis of the tumour are presented inFig. 3e. Many more MC-1 cells were detected in group I tumours. Independent of the distance from the injection site,Fig. 3fpresents the total number of injected or detected MC-1 cells in each group. The total number of directionally guided MC-1 cells is significantly greater than the number of cells not exposed to the magnetic field. This result demonstrates the importance of the directional magnetic field to achieve deep MC-1 penetration and distribution inside the tumour.
The targeting profile was further compared with two types of passive agent (that is, agents lacking the three functionalities previously mentioned: magnetotactic guidance, propelling force and sensory-based displacement). The first passive agent consisted of polymer microspheres and the second comprised dead MC-1 cells (seeMethods, ‘Live/dead mixture preparation’), which had previously undergone staining with a fluorescent cell penetrating peptide (CellTrace, CFSE Cell Proliferation Kit). When such passive agents are injected into the peritumoral region, they exhibit limited diffusion, probably due to the tumour interstitial fluid pressure15. Simultaneous peritumoral injection of live MC-1 cells with these passive agents was performed to compare their ability to diffuse and remain inside the tumour under the same experimental conditions. A 20 µl volume of Dragon green fluorescent polymer microspheres (maximum excitation/maximum emission = 480/520 nm, 1.9 µm, similar in size to the MC-1 spherical cells) and 20 µl of live MC-1 cells were injected, equivalent to∼2.92 × 107bacteria and∼1.35 × 107beads. This was followed by 30 min of magnetic guidance. In a separate set of experiments, 20 µl of dead MC-1cells were used instead of the polymer microspheres. Texas Red labelled secondary antibody was coupled to MC-1 staining, resulting in the live MC-1 cells being stained in red and the beads in green. Dead MC-1 cells appear yellow.
The active directional motility achieved via magnetotaxis and aerotaxis of the MC-1 cells resulted in superior penetration depths in HCT116 xenografts compared to the passive agents (in this case dead MC-1 cells and polymeric beads) (Fig. 4a–c). We observed a substantial decrease in the number of microspheres as sections were produced from deeper regions of the tumour, while the number of live MC-1 cells increased significantly (Fig. 4b). The co-localization of live MC-1–bead complexes (Fig. 4d) that occurred from the surface interaction of some beads with MC-1 cells suggests the potential for each MC-1 to carry a large payload deeply inside tumoral tissues. Similarly, live MC-1 cells located further away from the injection site and deeper in the tumour outnumbered dead MC-1 cells (Fig. 4e). The injection site exhibited a strong passive diffusion of the CellTrace, which led to the background fluorescence in which mostly dead MC-1 cells (yellow dots) and a few live MC-1 cells (red dots) were found.
a–d, Peritumoral injection of a mixture of MC-1 cells and similar sized polymer fluorescent microspheres.
e, Peritumoral injection of a mixture of dead and live MC-1 cells. For both methods, injection was followed by 30 min of magnetic guidance directed towards the centre of the tumoral volume. Ina, ×20 images are presented of MC-1 Texas Red fluorescent and FITC fluorescent microspheres at various tumoral depths in a longitudinal tumour section, showing superior penetration of MC-1 cells inside the tumour. The small wide strip marks the site where the tumour slice was cut into two parts: one larger and one smaller rectangle. The quantities of fluorescent microspheres and live MC-1 cells at various tumoral depths (b) from the experiment inadepict the superior penetration of live MC-1 cells well past the diffusion limits of the fluorescent microspheres. Inc, ×20 images are presented of MC-1 Texas Red fluorescent and FITC fluorescent beads 1, 3 and 6 mm inside the HCT116 xenograft, again showing the much higher penetration depths of the live MC-1 cells. Co-localization of MC-1 bead complexes at a tumoral depth of 4 mm (d) suggest the capability of MC-1 cells to transport large therapeutic payloads deep into tumoral tissues. Dead MC-1 cells are unable to move in the magnetic field and are located in the far left section, whereas live MC-1 cells, which typically migrate along the magnetic field, are located in the right section, confirming that they indeed move along the direction of the magnetic field. Ine, ×20 images are shown of live and dead MC-1 cells at different tumoral depths, showing the superior penetration of live cells into the tumours.
To evaluate the mean targeting ratio of MC-1 cells with covalently attached16(seeMethods, ‘Liposome attachment’) SN-38 drug-loaded liposomes (MC-1–LP) (Fig. 5a), we conducted additionalin vivoexperiments in HCT116-injected severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) beige mice. Among all potential nanocarriers, liposomes were selected as a first proof of concept because they are biocompatible, exhibit low immunogenicity and high flexibility, and protect the body from potential toxic cargo. Liposomes also shield therapeutic agents from premature degradation, control release kinetics and may encapsulate a multitude of hydrophilic and∕or hydrophobic drug cargos, pharmaceutical ingredients, imaging agents and genetic material by virtue of their aqueous interior and lipid exterior. Furthermore, cytotoxicity assays revealed that liposomal attachments to the MC-1 formulation improved the biocompatibility of the MC-1 cells and attachment did not interfere with liposomal uptake16. The diameter of each liposome was set to its optimal value of∼170 nm to maximize the quantity of drug cargo being transported per MC-1 cell.
a, Scanning electron microscopy images of unloaded MC-1 (left) and MC-1–LP (right) with∼70 SN-38 loaded liposomes (diameter,∼170 nm) attached to the surface of each cell.
b, Estimated mean ratios of MC-1–LP found in the tumour after targeting with a directional magnetic field. The total numbers of bacteria in the tumours were estimated by a direct count of the MC-1 cells obtained from homogenization of the tumours or image-processing techniques of transverse tumour sections. The data represent mean ± s.d. (n= 10 tumours). The numbers of bacteria were calculated using ten different tumours isolated from ten tumour-bearing mice collected in three independent experiments. Five tumours were homogenized to obtain the exact count and the other five were cut into numerous sections, stained and counted. The preliminary results already show a mean targeting ratio of 55%, similar to the targeting results achieved with unloaded MC-1 cells under the same experimental and physiological conditions. These results suggest that the MC-1 can be loaded without significantly affecting the targeting ratios in tumours.
c, Transverse tumour sections of MC-1–LP after targeting. Images of each section were acquired using a fluorescence optical microscope equipped with a ×40 magnification objective lens. The images show a good distribution of the loaded MC-1 cells throughout the tumour.
d, Examples of MC-1–LP distributions inside four different tumours. The differences in the locations of the hypoxic regions among the various xenografts lead to variations in the distributions of the loaded MC-1 cells between the targeted xenografts.
Similar to the results achieved with the unloaded MC-1 cells (Fig. 3), high targeting ratios of MC-1–LP (Fig. 5b) were obtained. Histological sections of the samples also revealed that the MC-1–LP liposomes were distributed throughout the xenografts (Fig. 5c,d), mainly in the neighbourhoods of hypoxic and necrotic areas and in large numbers in the centre of the tumour where necrosis and hypoxic regions predominated. The mean tumour targeting ratio (>50%) was first estimated from the samples using image-processing techniques (seeMethods, ‘MC-1 count’), allowing assessment of the distribution of the MC-1–LP complexes in the HCT116 xenografts. After excision of the tumours, HCT116 xenografts were also homogenized to evaluate and to confirm the number of MC-1 bacteria (Fig. 5b).
Our data predict that live MC-1 cells, with their therapeutically relevant potential as a drug carrier, are clinically safe (seeMethods, ‘Cytotoxicity assays in mice and rats’, andSupplementary Figs 3 and 4) and could be used as direct targeting agents (that is, agents that reach the target using the shortest physiological routes) to enhance the therapeutic index while reducing systemic exposure in currently used passive and active targeting methods17. As well as targeted chemotherapy, many other therapeutic modalities could benefit from such a delivery method, including but not limited to radiotherapeutic treatments18, which could be enhanced by radio-sensitizers being delivered into the tumour hypoxic regions19. Combining magnetotactic guidance, which relies on a weaker magnetic field independent of the MC-1 population (that is, while keeping the magnetic field strength constant, dosages can be increased using swarms that can largely exceed the∼100 million drug-loaded MC-1 cells per injection used for this study;Fig. 5b), with the self-propelling force of the MC-1 cells, would allow magnetic targeting20at any depth within a human adult, unlike magnetic nanoparticles and carriers21, which are limited by fast decays of induced forces with distance from the magnetization source. Depth-independent direct delivery methods such as magnetic resonance navigation22cannot be effectively applied to tumoral microenvironments due to the insufficient magnetic induction volume of the agents. Although microscopic artificial swimmers23could be envisioned as an alternative to the use of natural microorganisms, embedding an equivalent level of functionality in artificial agents to compete against such natural microorganisms in delivering therapeutics effectively to tumour hypoxic regions may prove to be a far-reaching concept.
Indeed, we have shown the possibility to harness sufficiently small microorganisms exhibiting magneto-aerotactic behaviours, such as the MC-1 cells. Each of these bacteria essentially function as an agent with oxygen gradient detectors connected to a low Reynolds hydrodynamic propelling system through some sort of embedded computation or intelligence, all in a <2 µm self-powered body capable of being directionally guided from an external source. When operating in a computer-controlled magnetic environment, such microorganisms can emulate artificial medical nanorobots or transporters that require characteristics and functionalities well beyond actual technological feasibility. Furthermore, such an approach could also benefit from the fact that bacteria-mediated delivery of nanoparticles and cargo into cells for various applications is already feasible24. Besides potential future efforts towards genetically modified carriers25based on known genome sequences26and the development of better magnetotactic guidance algorithms to increase the therapeutic index further, these initial findings may influence not only specific engineering concepts and medical interventional methods, but also open opportunities for the synthesis of new targeted therapeutic, imaging and diagnostic vectors while providing further opportunities to enhance the delivery and efficacy of existing nanocarriers.
MethodsMagnetotaxis directional controlEach animal was placed in the centre of a custom-made platform referred to as the ‘magnetotaxis system’. Although several configurations of the magnetotaxis system are possible, the version of the platform used for the experimentations consisted of three orthogonal pairs of electric coils positioned in a Maxwell configuration (Fig. 3a). A directional magnetic field generated by the magnetotaxis platform was applied towards the xenograft to guide the bacteria through the centre of the tumour. A focalized directional magnetic field of only∼15 G was applied for a predetermined period of 30 min (although much less than 30 min may be required for targeting) before being switched off to allow aerotaxis (aerotactic displacement of the MC-1 cells) to take effect.
Staining of the hypoxic regionsThe hydroxyprobe reaction was carried out according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, a Hypoxyprobe-1 Omni kit (Hypoxyprobe, PAb2627AP, 1/200) was applied on every sample at room temperature for 60 min. Sections were then incubated with a specific secondary anti-rabbit biotin conjugated for 32 min at room temperature. Finally, sections were counterstained with haematoxylin and bluing reagent for 4 min each (Ventana Medical Systems, Roche).
Immunohistology stainingSamples were fixed in 10% neutral buffer formalin, embedded in paraffin and sectioned at 4 µm. Labelling reactions (immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescence) were carried out in an automated immunostainer (Discovery XT, Ventana Medical Systems, Roche Group) using proprietary reagents. Polyclonal rabbit anti-MC1 receptor was applied (dilution 1/300 for 1 h at room temperature). The slides were then incubated with an FITC-labelled secondary anti-rabbit antibody to visualize the MC-1 receptor in green. A Texas Red-labelled secondary anti-rabbit antibody was used to visualize the MC-1 receptor in red. The slides were finally washed and mounted using ProLong Gold Antifade Reagent with DAPI (Invitrogen).
Digitization of transverse tumour sectionsTumours were paraffin-embedded and serially sectioned. Transverse tumour sections were scanned at ×40 magnification on a Nanozoomer 2HT (Hamamatsu) equipped for bright-field and fluorescence acquisition (triple filter cube DAPI/FITC/TxRed) or images of each section were acquired using a fluorescence optical microscope equipped with magnification objective lens.
Transmission electron microscopyRepresentative portions of the paraffin-embedded sections were reprocessed for transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Briefly, fragments of interest were dissected out of the paraffin blocks and reprocessed. Steps including dewaxing, rehydration, post-fixation in OsO4(osmium tetraoxyde) dehydration and embedding in Epon 812 were carried out. Ultrathin sections of OsO4blocks were created using a Reichert S Ultramicrotome and mounted on copper naked grids. Sections were contrasted with uranyl acetate and lead citrate before being examined using a Philips CM100 electron microscope, and digital micrographs were captured using an AMT XR80 charge-coupled device digital camera.
Bacteria preparation before injectionThe composition of the culture medium has been described previously (ref.
16). At the end of the exponential phase and before the beginning of the stationary phase, 50 ml of∼2 × 106MC-1 cells per ml were purified and washed three times in PBS by applying a two-dimensional magnetic field, before being resuspended in 100 µl PBS (pH 7.4).
Preparation of HCT116 tumour cellsThe HCT116 cell line was purchased from Horizon Discovery (www.horizondiscovery.com) and maintained in McCoy's 5A medium (Multicell) supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C in a 5% CO2incubator. The HCT116 cells are routinely tested for mycoplasma and have been confirmed to be negative forMycoplasmasp. infection. Two days before implantation, cells were divided into flasks with fresh growth medium. Cells were collected from the flasks using 0.05% trypsin–EDTA solution and collected by centrifuge at 450gfor 5 min. Cells were washed once with PBS and resuspended in PBS at a final concentration of 5 × 107cells per ml. To establish the tumour xenograft model, 100 µl of cell suspension were subcutaneously injected into the left flank of SCID beige mice (Charles River). Fewer than 5% of the animals (1 in 20 mice injected with HCT116 cells) occasionally displayed exceptionally slow growth of the tumour. These animals were excluded from the study. The two experimental groups (experimental group subjected to a magnetic field and the control group unexposed to the magnetic field) were randomized following measurement of the tumour sizes. All groups had similar (no statistically significant difference) average tumour sizes at the start of the experiment.
Live/dead mixture preparationA cell pellet of live MC-1 cells was obtained by magnetically concentrating 50 ml of a MC-1 solution. The pellet was suspended in PBS containing the probe, prepared as suggested by the manufacturer for 15 min at room temperature. The MC-1 cells were magnetically concentrated to reform the pellet and incubated for another 30 min at 42 °C, at which point the MC-1 cells became inactive, as assessed by microscopy observation. After heat treatment, the MC-1 cells did not recover motility and cell division, as also assessed by microscopy observation over the duration of the experiment.
Liposome attachmentThe attachment relies on direct chemical conjugation of liposomes functionalized with reactive groups (–COOH), which covalently bind to the primary amino groups (–NH2) intrinsic to bacteria cell membrane proteins. Carboxylated liposomes were conjugated to MC-1 by carbodiimide chemistry. Dehydrated agents such as EDC and sulfo-NHS were added to 3 ml of 0.5 mM liposomes suspension (1-ethyl-3-(3-(dimethylamino)propyl)-carbodiimide (EDC):N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide (NHS):1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-(carboxy(polyethylene glycol)) (DSPE-PEG-COOH) = 35:35:3, molar ratio) in PBS buffer (pH 6.5). The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 20 min. The free activating reagents were removed using a Sephadex G-50 column. Activated liposomes were then added to 50 ml of∼2 × 106MC-1 cells per ml and incubated for 2 h at room temperature, under gentle mixing. Liposomes attached to MC-1 cells were separated from non-attached liposomes by applying a two-dimensional magnetic field. The sample was washed three times in PBS and finally re-suspended in PBS (pH 7.4).
MC-1 countTo visualize and estimate the relative amounts of MC-1 cells present in histological sections sampled from tumours, images of each section were acquired using a fluorescence optical microscope equipped with a ×40 magnification objective lens or the transverse tumour sections were scanned at ×40 magnification. The acquired images were then processed using an automated software algorithm to evaluate the number of MC-1 cells in each histological section. This algorithm performed graphical enhancements on each image to count the number of cells. First, morphological erosion and dilation using a large disk-shaped structural element was performed to remove noise resulting from non-uniform lighting in the set-up, and the result of this operation was subtracted from the original image. Second, pixels were classified as belonging to MC-1 cells or the tumour background. Pixels classified as belonging to MC-1 cells needed to satisfy two conditions: (1) the hue of the pixel as part of the hue saturation value (HSV) colour space had to be in the range of hues that represent the bacteria in the histological image, and (2) the intensity (lightness value) of the pixel as part of the HSV colour space had to be better than a specific threshold of the bacteria appearing in the image. The total number of MC-1 cells in the tumour section was calculated by dividing the total number of MC-1 cell pixels by the average MC-1 cell size. This average MC-1 cell size was determined by summing the MC-1 cell classified pixels for 50 sample areas in which only one MC-1 cell was present. The MC-1 cell distributions shown inFig. 3c,dwere obtained by clustering the classified pixels into super-pixels. All super-pixels had dimensions of 128 × 128 pixels (844.25 µm2), and their intensities were given by the total number of MC-1 cell classified pixels forming the super-pixel.
To ensure the reliability of the counting software, five different sections in each tumour were randomly selected, and the bacteria in these sections were manually counted by microscopy observation and compared to the results obtained by the software-based image-processing techniques. The results showed negligible variations between the software-based and manual counting methods.
To study the penetration of live MC-1 cells with and without magnetic field exposure, the total number of MC-1 cells for all tumour sections located at the same distance from the injection site for each of the two groups was summed (in total, there were ten tumour xenografts per group, and each xenograft was cut at 2, 4, 6 and 8 mm from the injection site).
Figure 3c–erepresents the total number of MC-1 cells for each group at a given distance from the injection site.
Figure 3fshows the numbers of MC-1 cells in each tumour, estimated using equations from the linear interpolation between each adjacent and actual data point.
To generate plots for the MC-1–LP distribution inside the tumour (Fig. 5d), the numbers of MC-1 cells were plotted against the depth at which the sample was taken in the tumour. The number of MC-1 cells in each tumour was estimated by adding together the number of MC-1 cells corresponding to every sample taken at a certain depth inside the tumour with a step of 2 mm between each depth value from the position of the first histological section to the last. The curve data for each 2 mm step were calculated using equations from the linear interpolation between each adjacent and actual data point.
Once the animals were randomized into two different groups, the processing of samples and the analysis were performed using the animals’ unique ID numbers, which did not identify the experimental group to which they belonged. Group assignments of each animal were revealed for statistical analyses.
For each injection, a bacterial sample was counted as a reference. Because some of the peritumorally injected bacteria might not have penetrated the tumour, we estimated the percentage of bacteria found in the excised tumours. Some of the injected bacteria might have been dead and/or partly cleared from the tumour tissue, so the counts obtained represent only estimates for comparative purposes.
Code availabilityThe code used for counting the MC-1 cells is available at github.com (https://github.com/loghindo/NDPI_counting_MC1_bacteria).
Cytotoxicity assays in mice and ratsIn the systemic response to MC-1 cells, no significant differences were observed in the expression of inflammatory cytokines in the blood for PBS and MC-1 injections both in A/J and in C57BL6 mice.
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, when used as a positive control without MC-1 injection, induced inflammatory cytokines, IL-6 being induced at the highest level after 6 h. Immunogenicity and organ toxicity assessments were also conducted. Immunogenicity studies were performed using various doses of MC-1 and collecting blood as well as organs at various time points post IV infusion of MC-1 bacteria into two different strains of mice (A/J and C57BL/6). Following IV injection withP. aeruginosa, blood plasma displayed the highest levels of inflammatory cytokines compared to liver, spleen and lungs. MC-1 cells did not induce significant increases in inflammatory cytokine levels in the liver, spleen or lungs, as well as in the plasma. Rats were intravenously injected with 1×108MC-1 cells, and complete biochemical and haematological assessments were performed after 6, 24 and 72 h. Our preliminary results demonstrated that the injection of MC-1 cells did not lead to inflammation, as no changes in blood counts were detected and the biochemical parameters were within the normal range (Supplementary Figs 3 and 4).
MiceThe mice (all males) used in this study were SCID beige mice (Charles River). The mice were 8 weeks old and weighed approximately 22 g. All animals were pathogen-free, murine virus-free,Helicobacterand parasite-free. The animals were housed (one to four animals per cage) and maintained in a barrier facility unit under specific pathogen-free conditions with a 12 h light/dark cycle, at 22 ± 2 °C and at 50 ± 5% humidity. The animals were kept in polycarbonate (Lab Products) micro-isolator cages with sterile corn bedding (Harland Sprague–Dawley, catalogue no. 7097) and maintained in a ventilated rack (Lab Products) with a cycle of 50 changes of fresh HEPA filter air per hour in each cage. The mice were fed with NIH-31 modified mouse irradiated diet (Harlan Teklad). All mice hadad libidumaccess to food and sterile acidified water at pH 2.5.
The animal protocol was reviewed and approved by the university facility animal care committees of the Montréal General Hospital and Glen Institute. Our protocol is in compliance with the Canadian Council for Animal Care (CCAC).
A statistician was consulted for selecting the appropriate statistical tests. The assumptions were made based on the pilot study results, which showed a normal distribution among all animals. The animals assigned to each of the groups (experimental and control groups) were selected so that no statistical difference in the starting average tumour size was observed between groups.
