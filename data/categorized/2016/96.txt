#IASPGOLDCOAST2022 – Day 3After attending an amazing Pecha Kucha night filled with superlative presentations (not to mention wine and good company), I attended the 9AMsession on Surveillance of suicidal behaviour in the Western Pacific region. As somebody who has been personally involved in the Western Pacific Region (WPR) for the past year through IASP’s Regional Suicide Prevention Networks Programme, I was excited to hear about the experiences and issues related to surveillance of suicidal behaviour in the region. Prof. Kairi Kolves kicked off the session by talking about her collaboration with theWHOWestern Pacific regional office to explore surveillance systems for the collection of data onsuicidalbehaviour and suicidal ideation in the region.
Some of the things Kairi’s team was interested in included thefeasibilityof collecting data in a region as diverse as theWesternPacific and the availability offunding andresources.
Dr Vikas AryaResearch Fellow in Mental Health,University of MelbourneFollowing Kairi’s introduction to the session, DrSharnaMathieu gave a presentation on the current state of surveillance of suicide and self-harm in the WPR.
It was highlighted thataround a quarterof all suicides in the world occur in theWPR region, and that youth suicides might be driving most of these numbers, which was eye-opening.
More worryingly, because the qualityof surveillance is variableacross the region, these numbers are likely an underestimation of the true number of suicides.
The quality of surveillance suffers due to various issues including difficulty in accessing services,stigma, funding,and lack of multisectoral collaboration.
On a positive note, most of the countries in the WPR region have some level of surveillance system for suicide in place.
The following talk fromKairiKolves expanded on Sharna’s presentation, talking about the importance of good data.
Good data is vital to designing appropriate suicide prevention policies as without good data, we wouldn’t know where to direct our resources! The timeliness of the data is also crucial. A perfect example of that is therecent publication by Prof. Jane Pirkis and colleagueswhich looked at trends of suicide around the world during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to lack of surveillance systems and/or reliable and timely data, the publication mostly consisted of data from high-income countries where good surveillance systems exist and work in a timely manner.
Dr Katrina Witt in her presentation on the development of self-harm monitoring system in the state of Victoria in Australia,highlighted that even in a high–income country such as Australia, setting up surveillance systemscomes with aunique set of challenges, including, manually processing data before using natural language processing (e.g. automation using computersoftware). The other major hurdle is consistently applying to renew funding for the surveillance system (usually yearly but Katrina andcolleaguesaretryingto get 5-year funding). Kairi Kolves mentioned that they also tried to set up a similar self-harm surveillance system in Queensland but it was shut down in 2016 due to lack of funding. Finally, Dr Paula Valera presented on developing a data registry for self-harm in the Philippines.
The system was recently developed and piloted for 10 weeks in 3 hospitals. Data from the pilot study has already shed lightona couple of unique suicide means used in the Philippines, highlightingthe importance and usefulness of surveillance systems. However, moving forward, Paula mentioned similar issues with the sustenance of this surveillance system in the long term including funding.
As the session drewtowards its end, I couldn’t help but feel a bit frustratedbythe ugly realisation thateven an endeavour as noble as trying to save someone’s life,is held hostage to the almighty dollar!But in that moment of disappointment, Ialsofound reassuring solacein the fact thatso manypeople aredoingtheirbest to drive change and as our voices grow, we are bound to succeed!I was lucky enough to co-chair OralSession 10with the indomitable, Prof. Jane Pirkis.
Helene Nielsen spoke abouttheUrgent Mental Health Care Centre situated in Adelaide which is an alternative totheemergency department where people experiencing suicidal distress can walk in and seek support from professionals. I found it to be an extremely innovative and useful service which calls their clients ‘guests’ instead of patients and instead of having code blacks (such as in a hospital), having ‘code comfort’. I hope more centres such as these open all around the world!KazuMoriguchi’spresentation talked about Japan’s Suicide Countermeasures PromotionCenter(JSCP) which, along with conducting other activities, provides training for local government officials and private organisations involved in suicide countermeasure activities. While the initiative is still in its developmental stage, it seems poised to bring much-needed skills and knowledge to many people and organisations in Japan. Next was PetaDampney’spresentation which asked some hard questions around the feasibility of some of the existing suicide prevention goals such as ‘zero suicide’. For those of us who know Peta personally, it was a quintessential Peta presentation which made us laugh, cry, and self-reflect, all at the same time. Next was Sandersan Onie’s (aka Sandy) presentation on Indonesia’s First Suicide Prevention Strategy. Sandy talked about how Indonesia requires a multi-faceted approach to address multiple issues ranging from religion and stigma to data and reporting. Sandy’s presentation made me draw a lot of parallels with the issues plaguing suicide prevention efforts in India. It was heartening to see Sandy and his colleagues leading the noble effort to design Indonesia’s first national strategy and we wish them all the success! The next presenters, YasminParpioandSalimaFarooq talked about applying western suicide prevention approaches in Pakistan. They outlined an approach to produce training for Bachelor of Nursing students in Pakistan and other community helpers in suicide intervention skills based on theLivingWorksNetwork of Safety evidence-based model. I was especially encouragedto see such approaches being developed in Pakistan which, like many otherLAMICS, can benefit a great deal from the introduction of such programmes. Also, the two presenters were from the Agha Khan University in Karachi where our past IASP president, Prof. Murad Khan is located. I am sure he is delighted to see these developments! The last presentation fromYasuyukiShimizu, discussed Japan’s National Strategy for Suicide Countermeasures during the COVID-19 crisis.
Yasuyukihighlighted that the Japanese government launched emergency economic measures related to COVID-19, taking into account the perspective of suicide countermeasures, at a very early stage of the pandemic which could have helped with curbing suicides in the country. However, he also mentioned that Japan did experience an increase in suicides in 2020, possible due to due to reports of suicides by celebrities, and hence, there is a need for further promotion of suicide countermeasures. A fun fact aboutYasuyuki, he started his career as a television producer, and making a documentary on children who had lost a parent to suicide, ‘changed his life’.
Havingheard so much already, it washardto think we were already coming towards the end of the conference.
Keynote sessions focusing on issues around priority settings, media and refugees & displaced personsfollowed. I was tempted to try and cover all three keynotes buthappy in the knowledgethat we can access all session recordings beyond the conference,Paul Yip, Jo Robinson and S. M. Yasir Arafatprovidedvaried approaches and insights into online interventions, young people’sperspectives and the challenges around media reporting and suicide.
This was insightful, engaging andmost of all positive, with promising ways forwardsfor the role of all media forums.
As we alltook our seatsfor the closingceremony, it was great to hear such passion fromJo Robinson & Lai Fong Chanas theybrought the proceedings to a close.
Sponsored byBlackdogInstitute, the closing plenaries drew on themes covered throughout the past few days of the conference. Stephen Scott fromRoses in the Oceankicked off the plenariesbychallenging the areas of improvement formeaningful involvement ofthosewith lived/livingexperiencewithin future conferences. FollowedbyEmmanuel Nii-Boye Quarshie, whohighlightedwhere more needs to be done to prevent suicides in lower- and middle-income countries, whilst Maddison O’Grady Lee from Black Dog Institutedetailed the harsh realities of many First Nation young people who attempt to seek help.
After some slight technical difficulties, it was great to see IASP President, Rory O’Connor on screen tuning in virtually, posing the question of what elsewe could be doingto ensure that research evidence is informing policy and practice.
It’s crucial to keep asking the difficult questions in the field of suicide preventionto keeppushing for improvement to strengthenourresearch. The closing words ofLakshmi Vijayakumarperfectly reminds us how important it is to keep persevering and motivates us to keep pressing on – “Let’s go back with more commitment and compassion.
”This conference hasbeen an amazing opportunity to see and meet colleagues face to face after so long which really makes a world of difference when focusing on such difficult and complex topics. Thank you IASP, I left APAC 2022 feeling inspired and driven and can’t wait for the next one.

#SuicidePrevention🧠 Depression can affect anyone. In 2019, 37 million people in th EU were diagnosed with chronic #depression (Source: Eurostat, 2021). To combat this, better public mental health care and less stigma around mental health are needed.
