AboutMachineScienceConstructionAssemblyNews & MediaTopEquipment is arrivingNow that the civil work on the twin buildings is nearly completed, the installation of equipment can begin. Equipment is expected from China, Korea, Russia and India. Follow all installation and commissioning news on the assembly pages of the ITER website (https://www.iter.org/construction/assembly).
20 May 2019Transformer StreetOf the 32 transformers needed for First Plasma, 30 have already been delivered to ITER from China and Korea. In this photo, Chinese transformers are being installed in their dedicated bays outside of one of the twin buildings.
20 May 2019Busbar supportInside the buildings, workers are installing supports for Russian-procured busbars that will be installed to deliver DC power to the magnets. The equipment will leave the buildings over two 50-metre-long bridges.
20 May 2019Two stand outThe twin Magnet Power Conversion buildings are highlighted in this image of the ITER worksite.
20 May 2019Three plant buildings handed overThe European Domestic Agency Fusion for Energy hands over three completed buildings to the ITER Organization in March: the twin Magnet Power Conversion buildings and a smaller facility for reactive power compensation. Equipment installation can now begin.

29 March 2019Transformer WayEquipment from China and Korea is arriving for the Magnet Power Conversion buildings on site. Two 150-metre twin buildings will act as the AC/DC adapter that converts current coming out of the electrical distribution network into the DC current required by the magnets.
27 November 2018Transformers moved on siteFour transformers recently delivered to the ITER site have been moved to their final berths. In the lot, were three central solenoid converters procured by Korea and one poloidal field coil rectifier procured by China. ITER's Field Engineering Installation Division was in charge of the operation.

27 October 2016Site work begins for Magnet Power Conversion buildingsIn this vast area between the electrical switchyard and the Tokamak Pit, preparatory works have started on the site of two power conversion buildings.

24 June 2016Magnet power conversionWork will be starting soon in this area of the platform, reserved for the two Magnet Power Conversion buildings.
02 June 2016Projects mushroomingPreparatory works have begun for the buildings that will house the giant magnets power conversion units. As for all other buildings, the process kicks off with "soil investigation," where long drill bits are pushed as much as 15 metres below the surface in order to identify possible discontinuities or cavities created by water erosion (karsts). Holes are bored approximately every five metres.
