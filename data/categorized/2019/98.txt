ContentsPlot[edit]In 1986, a young girl named Adelaide—"Addy" for short—watches a commercial forHands Across America. At night, at theSanta Cruz Beach Boardwalk, she wanders away from her parents and enters afunhouse, where she encounters adoppelgängerof herself in thehouse of mirrors.
Years later, an adult Adelaide goes on vacation with her husband, Gabriel "Gabe" Wilson, and their children Zora and Jason. She is apprehensive about the trip, haunted by memories of the encounter and her recovery, during which she stopped speaking and withdrew from her family. Despite her misgivings, the family meet with their friends Josh and Kitty Tyler and their twin daughters at the beach. On the way there, they witness paramedics taking away a body of an old man, blood on his chest. Jason later sees someone strangely similar to the old man, standing still with his arms outstretched and hands bloody.
That night, Adelaide tells Gabe about her childhood accident, but she is stopped by a family of four dressed in red that appears in the driveway of the home before breaking into the house. Cornering the Wilsons in their own living room, the family is revealed as their doppelgängers. They include Pluto (Jason'sfire-loving, mouth-scarred double), Umbrae (Zora's sadistic double), and Abraham (Gabe's double), and are led by Red (Adelaide's double), the only one who can speak, albeit in a guttural, raspy voice. Red explains that they are called "the Tethered” as they share a soul with their lookalike counterparts, and they have come to "untether" themselves. She tells them the story of a girl who lives a life of comfort and joy while her "shadow" remains in the dark, suffering while living a mirrored, painful version of the girl's life and hating the girl for it. The Wilsons are separated and terrorized by their demented doppelgängers. Adelaide is handcuffed and Jason discovers that Plutomirrors his actions. After Gabriel finally kills Abraham, the family gets on their boat together to find help.
Meanwhile, the Tyler family is assaulted and murdered by their own doppelgängers at home. The Wilsons arrive and are assaulted as well, but they manage to eventually overpower and kill the Tylers' doubles. Realizing they are not the only people with doppelgängers, they turn on the news to see that the Tethered have been murdering their equivalents across the U.S., and after doing so, joining hands to form a massive human chain. The Wilsons decide to drive along the coast and escape to Mexico. While leaving, Umbrae attacks the car and Zora kills her by sending her flying into a tree where she is impaled on a tree branch.
Arriving at the boardwalk, the Wilsons find the townspeople already slaughtered. They also find the road blocked by a burning car. Jason, realizing it is a trap set by Pluto, orders everyone out of the car. Before Pluto can ignite the family's car, Jason backs away so that Pluto mirrors him and walks into the burning car. As Pluto dies, Red suddenly appears and snatches Jason. While Gabe recuperates from his wounds with Zora in an ambulance, Adelaide chases after Red to the funhouse where they first met. She finds a secret entrance that leads to an underground facility overrun by white rabbits, where she finds Red in a classroom.
Red tells Adelaide that "the Tethered" are actuallygenetic clonescreated by the government to control the originals on the surface. When the experiment failed, the Tethered were abandoned underground for generations, mindlessly mimicking the actions of their counterparts and surviving on rabbit meat. After they realized that Red was "different from the others,” she organized them to escape and take vengeance by murdering their counterparts. Red and Adelaide begin to "fight" in the form of ballet, with Red gracefully evading and countering all of Adelaide's increasingly unbalanced attacks. When Adelaide allows Red to attack, she impales Red with afireplace poker, then strangles her to death and breaks her neck, before rescuing Jason from a locker. Jason also rescues one of the rabbits.
While Adelaide drives the family away in the ambulance, she suddenly remembers the terrifying night she first met Red in the hall of mirrors. It is revealed that the clone had choked Adelaide unconscious (damaging her larynx, making her voice raspy and guttural sounding), dragged her underground, handcuffed her there, and returned above ground to take Adelaide's place in her life, eventually learning to speak and adjusting as a human being; she is thus the Tethered clone and Red (who she just killed) was the real Adelaide.
Jason looks suspiciously at his mother, who merely gives him a sly smile. A finalaerial shotshows that the Tethered have formed a human chain, replicating theHands Across Americademonstration, stretching across the United States as helicopters hover overhead.
Cast[edit]Production[edit]Development[edit]After being dismayed with the "genre confusion" over his previous film,Get Out,[5]Peele opted to make his next film a "full-on" horror film.
[6]Peele has said that an inspiration forUswasThe Twilight Zoneepisode "Mirror Image", which was centered on a young woman and her evil doppelgänger.
[5]Peele has also said that the idea of the "tethered" living underground came to him as a teenager when he would take the train home from work.
[7]"You get out of the train and you have to go down through an underpass and come out the other side. There's no one else there, just this dark, American town. I'd come up and I'd look over to the other side, and I'd picture seeing the tail end of myself going down that same tunnel, to presumably emerge right near me 30 seconds later. And I can't be seen by that other version of me...It was a very scary day as I saw my double but I instantly knew it wasn't real and the idea popped into my head."Casting[edit]On May 8, 2018, it was announced thatLupita Nyong'o,Winston DukeandElisabeth Mosswere all in negotiations to star in the film, with Nyong'o and Duke portraying a black couple, and Moss portraying one half of a white couple.
[8]Nyong'o later confirmed her casting by posting the film's promotional poster on herInstagram.
[9]The rest of the cast, includingTim Heidecker,Yahya Abdul-Mateen II,Shahadi Wright Josephand Evan Alex were all confirmed in July of that year.
[10]Peele saw the characters of the film as an "archetypal foursome," with Adelaide being the leader, Zora being the warrior, Gabe being jester/fool and Jason being the wiz/magician.
[11]For her role, Nyong'o had to use a different voice for the character of Red. She said her performance was inspired by the conditionspasmodic dysphonia, a condition that causes a person's voice to go into periods ofspasm. In order to perfect her voice, she, "...worked with an ear, nose, and throat doctor, a vocal therapist, and my dialect coach to try and make sure I could do it and do it safely. 'Cause I had two roles to play, I couldn't afford to damage my voice."[12]Filming[edit]Principal photographybegan on July 30, 2018, inSanta Cruz, California, including their famousBoardwalk. Most of the film was shot inLos Angeles, and the main house featured is located inPasadena. The house had modifications and the team spent 6 weeks there.

[14]Post-production[edit]The visual effects were provided byIndustrial Light & Magicand supervised by Grady Cofer.
[15]Michael Abels, who had previously scored Peele'sGet Out, returned to do the same forUs.
[16]Soundtrack[edit]The 1995Lunizsong "I Got 5 on It" is featured in this film, first at the beginning, when the family is driving to the beach and then later on in the film when the "tethered" family breaks into the vacation home. The once-fun song transmogrifies into an eerie "Tethered Mix", slowing everything down, and fully indulging the ominous quality of the film. Due to the track's popularity upon the trailer's release, it was edited into the final cut of the film, appearing during the climax.
[17]Waxwork Records announced in August 2019 that they would release the soundtrack to the film on vinyl, which contained Abels' popular score.
[18]TheN.W.Asong "Fuck tha Police" is also heard when Kitty Tyler tells the voice assistant Ophelia to "call the police", moments before she is killed by her Tethered counterpart, Dahlia, and the song plays throughout when the Wilsons enter the Tyler family's home.
Marketing[edit]The official trailer was released on December 25, 2018.
[19]The trailer, which was set to a darker version of the song "I Got 5 on It", featured a similar tone, editing, and shots as Peele'sGet Out, prompting speculation that the two films were set in the same universe.
[20]A second trailer was released on February 3, 2019, forSuper Bowl LIII. That trailer featured a narration by Lupita Nyong'o's character, Adelaide, speaking with her husband Gabriel about the strange coincidences happening since they arrived at their beach house, and describing it as a "black cloud" hanging over them. The new theatrical release date, March 22, was announced at the end of the trailer.
[21]Deadline Hollywoodestimated the studio spent around $77 million on promotion and advertisements for the film.
[22]Release[edit]Ushad its world premiere at theSouth by Southwestfilm festival (SXSW) on March 8, 2019.

[3]Deadline Hollywoodcalculated the net profit of the film to be $119million, when factoring together all expenses and revenues.
[28]In the United States and Canada, initial tracking hadUsgrossing $35–40million in its opening weekend.
[29]By the week of its release, estimates had risen to $45–50million, with advance ticket sales onFandangooutpacingA Quiet Place($50.2 million) andGet Out($33.7 million).
[30]The film made $29.1 million on its first day, including $7.4 million from Thursday night previews, one of the best-ever for a horror film and far higher than the $1.8 million Thursday grossed byGet Out, increasing weekend estimates forUsto $68 million.
[31]It went on to debut to $71.1 million, ranking number one at the box office and becoming the second best opening for a live-action original film afterAvatar($77 million in 2009), as well as the third-best total for a horror film afterIt($123.4 million in 2017) andHalloween($77 million in 2018) and the best ever opening for an original horror film not based on a known property.
[22][32]In its second weekend, the film made $33.6 million, dropping 52.7% (slightly above-average for a horror film but much larger than the 15% seen byGet Out) and finishing second behind newcomerDumbo.
[33]Critical response[edit]Onreview aggregatorRotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 93% based on 553 reviews, with an average rating of 7.9/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "With Jordan Peele's second inventive, ambitious horror film, we have seen how to beat the sophomore jinx, and it isUs."[34]OnMetacritic, the film has aweighted averagescore of 81 out of 100, based on 56 critics, indicating "universal acclaim".
[35]Audiences polled byCinemaScoregave the film an average grade of "B" on an A+ to F scale, while those atPostTrakgave it an overall positive score of 80%, with 60% saying they would definitely recommend it.
[22]Uswas described byRolling Stoneas "spill-your-soda scary", compared to the "existentially terrifying"Get Out.
[5]Monica Castillo ofRogerEbert.comgave the film four out of four, writing that: "Usis another thrilling exploration of the past and oppression this country is still too afraid to bring up. Peele wants us to talk, and he's given audiences the material to think, to feel our way through some of the darker sides of the human condition and the American experience."[36]David Griffin ofIGNgave the film 9.0/10, calling it "a very, very strange film. But that's OK because it wouldn't be a Jordan Peele joint if there wasn't a little risk involved. Peele has proven that he's not a one-hit wonder with this truly terrifying, poignant look at one American family that goes through hell at the hands of maniacal doppelgangers".
[37]John DeFore ofThe Hollywood ReportercalledUs"a fiercely scary movie whose meaning is up for grabs".
[1]Richard BrodyofThe New Yorkercalled the film a "colossal achievement," writing, "Usis a horror film—though saying so is like offering a reminder thatThe Godfatheris a gangster film or that2001: A Space Odysseyis science fiction. Genre is irrelevant to the merits of a film, whether its conventions are followed or defied; what matters is that Peele cites the tropes and precedents of horror in order to deeply root his film in the terrain of pop culture—and then to pull up those roots."[38]Conversely, Stephanie Zacharek ofTimethought Peele had too many ideas and not enough answers compared toGet Outand said, "Peele goes even deeper into the conflicted territory of class and race and privilege; he also ponders the traits that make us most human. But this time, he's got so many ideas he can barely corral them, let alone connect them. He overthinks himself into a corner, and we're stuck there with him."[39]Themes and interpretations[edit]Critic Jim Vejvoda related the Tethered to "urban legends" and "xenophobicparanoia about theOther", also writing they resembled theMorlocksinH. G. Wells's 1895 novel,The Time Machine.
[40]Journalist Noel Ransome viewed the film as being about "the effects ofclassismand marginalization", writing "the Tethered are effigies of this same situational classism. They're trapped—mentally and physically—and ignored".
[41]Joel Meares of Rotten Tomatoes also noted that the Tethered, referencing the "we're Americans" line, are representatives of the duality of American society, how some citizens can afford to live on top of the class system while others are stuck in poverty. He also noted the titleUscould mean "U.S.", or United States.
[42]Manohla DargisofThe New York Timesnotes that the Wilsons are "introduced with an aerial sweep of greenery" similar to the opening ofStanley Kubrick'sThe Shining, and sees that movie as the principal influence onUs. Describing Peele as a "true cinephile", she also identifies allusions to other films, includingJaws,A Nightmare on Elm Street, andThe Goonies, as well as one scene suggesting an influence by the Austrian film directorMichael Haneke's 1997 horror filmFunny Gamesand subsequentU.S. remake.
[43]The Tethered's red jump suits and single glove were an allusion toMichael Jacksonalong with the "Thriller" shirt seen on young Adelaide, and Peele has stated that Jackson was "the patron saint of duality".
[42][44]Peele referenced many other instances of 1980s culture, including allusions toThe Lost Boysand Hands Across America, stating "Everything in this movie was deliberate, that is one thing I can guarantee you. Unless you didn't like something and that was a complete accident".
[44][45]The film contains numerous references toJeremiah 11:11, which reads: "Therefore thus saith the Lord: 'I will bring on them a disaster they cannot escape. Although they cry out to me, I will not listen to them'" (NIV). Critic Rosie Fletcher commented on the context, withJeremiahwarningJerusalemwas facing destruction due tofalse idols, and expressed the opinion that the film's characters also "worshiped the wrong things", such as Ophelia, thevirtual assistant.
[46]Peele later explained in the film's digital release special features that a central theme of the film isAmerican privilege:[47]"One of the central themes inUsis that we can do a good job collectively of ignoring the ramifications ofprivilege. I think it's the idea that what we feel like we deserve comes, you know, at the expense of someone else's freedom or joy. You know, the biggest disservice we can do as a faction with a collective privilege like the United States is to presume that we deserve it, and that it isn't luck that has us born where we're born. For us to have our privilege, someone suffers. That's where the Tethered connection, I think, resonates the most, is that those who suffer and those who prosper are two sides of the same coin. You can never forget that. We need to fight for the less fortunate."Accolades[edit]Uswas nominated for oneArt Directors Guild,[48]fourCritics' Choice Movie Awards,[49]oneMake-Up Artists and Hair Stylists Guild,[50]threeMTV Movie & TV Awards,[51]eightNAACP Image Awards,[52]fourPeople's Choice Awards,[53]oneBram Stoker Award(won),[54]sevenSaturn Awards(winning one),[55]oneScreen Actors Guild Award,[56]and oneWorld Soundtrack Awards(won).
