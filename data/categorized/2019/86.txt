Since early days at IBM, we have always been led by Thomas J. Watson Jr.’s famous 1953 memo: “It is the policy of this organization to hire people who […]Continue readingShare this post:IBM Research-TokyoIBM scientists demo social simulatorReal life is taking a step closer to The Sims video game series. This week at SuperComputing 17 in Denver, Colorado, the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) is introducing series of demos, including new research from IBM scientists in Japan which can simulate social situations such as shopping at the mall or an emergency […]Continue readingShare this post:IBM Research-TokyoBio-inspired machine learning goes open sourceSince our bio-inspired machine learning technology “Dynamic Boltzmann Machine (DyBM)” debuted in the fall of 2015, we received many comments on the music demo and human evolution image that we used to show how an artificial neural network learns about different topics in different formats. Many developers expressed interest in using the code to let […]Continue readingShare this post:IBM Research-TokyoIoT neurons go macro, go global with DyBMImagine covering the globe with a sheet of artificial, internet-enabled neurons. And these Internet of Things (IoT) neurons could send their local information to other neurons just like the synapses in our brains. For example, a ground temperature neuron at one location gets collected and shared with air quality neurons, and vice versa. This spatio-temporal […]Continue readingShare this post:IBM Research-TokyoIBM Research at IJCAI: Pushing new AI frontiers from Down UnderFor the first time in 26 years, Australia is hosting the globally revered International Joint Conference for Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI). The greatest minds in artificial intelligence (AI) from across the globe will descend on Melbourne next week to present the latest advancements in training machines to learn, reason and interact in a natural, human-like way. […]Continue readingShare this post:IBM Research-TokyoIBM Research at CVPR 2017: Helping AI systems to see with computer visionThis week IBM Research will be participating at the Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) in Honolulu, Hawaii from July 21 –25. As a major computer vision event, it’s a place for researchers, academics, students, and even investors to learn about the latest advances in the field. IBM’s presence this year includes multiple […]Continue readingShare this post:IBM Research-TokyoIBM’s Spark scientists show off their latest code at SummitSince its inaugural event in 2013, thousands of developers, scientists, analysts, researchers and executives from around the globe have trekked to the Spark Summit to talk about how the open source processing engine known as Apache Spark can apply big data, machine learning and data science to deliver new insights. With more than 1,000 contributors […]Continue readingShare this post:IBM ResearchThe world is our labLearn moreConnect with us
