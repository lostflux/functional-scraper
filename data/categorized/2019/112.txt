Countries like China are already investing in programs to raise IQ scores by up to 15 points every successive generation. Capabilities like these, unthinkable for most of history, raise existential questions: What, if anything, is the essence of what makes us human? How can AI augment our intelligence? Should we even use it for that purpose? Do we have a choice? This panel will draw on the knowledge of a diverse group of science and technology experts to explore the economic, ethical, and existential implications of using AI and robotics to enhance humans of the future.
