AI2020 AI Predictions from IBM ResearchDecember 17, 2019 | Written by:Sriram RaghavanCategorized:AIShare this post:The field of artificial intelligence (AI) experienced tremendous scientific advances in the last few years, from vast improvements in processing power and computational efficiency to new insights into object identification, language, and deep learning. IBM — a leader in AI research since its inception in the 1950s — helped inform many of these advances. And 2019 in particular was a watershed moment for IBM Research AI.
Over the course of the year, IBM researchers hit a new record of 175 regular accepted papers at eight of the top AI conferences, hosted the second annualAI Research Weekin September, and launched theAI Hardware Centerto further exploration of next-generation AI hardware. TheMIT-IBM Watson AI Lab, now in its second year, flourished — welcoming Boston Scientific, Nexplore, Refinitiv and Samsung as inaugural members of its newMembership Program. In another big step toward the goal of mastering language, IBM Project Debater took on champion debater Harish Natarajan in February 2019 at IBM’s Think conference, beforeteaming upwith him and other human debaters in November at Cambridge Union, the world’s oldest debating society. IBM researchers also continued their focus on building and enabling AI solutions people can trust, furthering the ability of AI to explain its recommendations to humans with the open-sourceAI Explainability 360 toolkit. These are just some of the notable AI achievements of IBM researchers this year.
In 2020, three themes will shape the advancement of AI: automation, natural language processing (NLP), and trust. Broadly, we’ll see AI systems work more quickly and more easily for data scientists, businesses, and consumers through automation. NLP will play a key role in enabling AI systems to converse, debate, and solve problems using everyday language. And with each of these advances, we’ll see more transparent and accountable practices emerge for managing AI data, through tools ranging from explainability to bias detection.

Private and public enterprises, academia, government and technology companies, many of whom are typically rivals. “It is simply unprecedented,” said Dario Gil, Senior Vice President and Director of IBM Research, one of the founding organizations. “The outcomes we’ve achieved, the lessons we’ve learned, and the next steps we have to pursue are all the result of the collective efforts of these Consortium’s community.” The next step? Creating the National Strategic Computing Reserve to help the world be better prepared for future global emergencies.
