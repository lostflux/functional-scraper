The IBM team came up with a novel technique for synthesizing samples with multiple labels.

Each patient’s image collection can contain 250GB of data, ultimately creating collections across organizations that are petabytes in size. Within IBM Research, we see potential in […]Continue readingShare this post:IBM Research-HaifaVideo Scene Detection Using Optimal Sequential GroupingOur team at IBM Research recently developed a new approach for automated video scene detection. Videos are used today for everything from entertainment and marketing to knowledge-sharing, news, and social journaling. Automated scene detection can help consumers and enterprises utilize this video content in new ways. Video scene detection is the task of temporally dividing […]Continue readingShare this post:IBM Research-HaifaDesigning adaptive cyber-physical systems – from undersea monitoring to landing on MarsCyber-physical systems, or CPS for short, are sophisticated computer devices that work together to perform functions, control physical elements, and respond to human control. They are already being used in auto-pilot systems for aircraft, advanced robotic systems, smart grids, medical monitoring, and search and rescue. In fact, most Internet of Things (IoT) devices are CPS. […]Continue readingShare this post:IBM ResearchThe world is our labLearn moreConnect with us
