Thomas J Watson Research CenterUsing SecDevOps to design and embed security and compliance into development workflowsIBM Research has initiated focused efforts called Code Risk Analyzer to bring security and compliance analytics to DevSecOps. Code Risk Analyzer is a new feature of IBM Cloud Continuous Delivery, a cloud service that helps provision toolchains, automate builds and tests, and control quality with analytics.

At the start of our collaboration, we proposed an approach to develop AI-based models that combine and […]Continue readingShare this post:Thomas J Watson Research CenterImpact of the SQL Relational Model 50 years laterFifty years ago this month, IBM researcher and computing pioneer Edgar Frank Codd published the seminal paper “A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks,” which became the foundation of Structured Query Language (SQL), a language originally built to manage structured data with relational properties. Today SQL is one of the world’s most […]Continue readingShare this post:Thomas J Watson Research CenterIBM Research AI at ICASSP 2020The 45th International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing is taking place virtually from May 4-8. IBM Research AI is pleased to support the conference as a bronze patron and to share our latest research results, described in nine papers that will be presented at the conference.

It’s also champagne, wine, gin… and, of course, whisky. And it better be genuine. IBM researchers are working on technologies to help you make sure the whisky you buy is indeed what it says on the […]Continue readingShare this post:Thomas J Watson Research CenterIBM Research advances in end-to-end speech recognition at INTERSPEECH 2019IBM scientists presented three papers at INTERSPEECH 2019 that address the shortcomings of End-to-end automatic approaches for speech recognition - an emerging paradigm in the field of neural network-based speech recognition that offers multiple benefits.

To build this ground-breaking new system to meet these client demands, IBM Research partnered with IBM Systems to help develop a new […]Continue readingShare this post:Thomas J Watson Research CenterHelping to Untangle Cancer Drug Resistance with DataWhy do targeted cancer therapies often fail? We have acquired so much more understanding about cancer in the last fifty years than in the last five thousand years. Approaches to patient treatments have dramatically changed, and statistics show significant improvement in patient response and outcomes to therapy in the last half a century [1]. Yet […]Continue readingShare this post:Thomas J Watson Research CenterOvercoming Challenges in Building Enterprise AI AssistantsA team of researchers from IBM Research AI and AI Horizons Network-partner the University of Michigan published the papers “A Large-Scale Corpus for Conversation Disentanglement” and “Learning End-to-End Goal-Oriented Dialog with Maximal User Task Success and Minimal Human Agent Use” at ACL 2019. This work address two main challenges in building enterprise AI assistants.
