We aim to:OUR APPROACHOur workDisrupting SurveillanceAcross the world, hard won rights are being weakened and denied every day. And increasingly, much of the repression faced by human rights defenders is digital. Since 2017, Amnesty Tech’s investigations have exposed vast and well-orchestrated digital attacks against activists and journalists in countries such asMorocco,Egypt,Azerbaijan,Qatar, Mexico andPakistan.
Amnesty Tech aims to counter digital repression by:TheSecurity Lab, launched in 2019 and located in Berlin, leads technical investigations into cyber-attacks against civil society and provides critical support when individuals face such attacks. The Lab also builds tools and services to help protect human rights defenders from cyber-attacks, and conducts technical training with the wider support community to help them identify and respond to digital threats.
Our global team of technologists – including in Tunis, Dakar and Nairobi – also provide digital security training and one-on-one support to activists, as well as security audits for partner NGOs.
We also focus on the secretive surveillance tech industry, including campaigning to stop the export of tech which risks being used to target human rights activists.
In 2019, we supported a legal action againstIsraeli spyware firm NSO Group, whose intrusive products have been used in attacks on activists in Mexico, Saudi Arabia and UAE, including an attack against one of our own staff members.
In October 2019, we uncoveredtargeted digital attacksagainst two prominent Moroccan human rights defenders using NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware. We are also carrying out further investigations of abuses linked to the company.
Secure Squadis trained network of volunteers who have signed up to provide peer support on tech and security to HRDs within their own communities.
Those at the forefront of combating climate change are heavily targeted by infiltration and surveillance. We have initiated a project to provide more digital security support toenvironmental defenders, who remain underserved in terms of technical and security support.
Big data and AICompanies such as Facebook and Google have created an endless quest to drive profits through data capture, constructing a global surveillance infrastructure that goes beyond anything we have seen in history. It is clear these trends are already impacting the very core of our societies.
In the US,Cambridge Analyticamisused intimate personal Facebook data to micro-target and influence swing voters in the last presidential election. Since taking power, Donald Trump has tried toharness the power of big datato bolster his own aggressive policies targeting Muslims.
In the US and Europe, the algorithms powered by Facebook and YouTube have deepened polarization and fanned hate – contributing to the rise of the far-right. In China, a sophisticated web of “dataveillance” technologies have tightened the government’s grip on social control and aided the persecution of minority groups like the Uighurs.
In 2018, Amnesty and Access Now launched theToronto Declaration, a landmark statement on the human rights impact of machine learning systems on the right to equality and non-discrimination. It was widely endorsed by civil society, but the reception from tech companies hasbeen decidedly cold.
In November 2019, Amnesty launched aground-breaking reporton how the surveillance-based business model of companies like Facebook and Google undermines fundamental rights, including the right to privacy and free expression. Amnesty is also looking at the human rights impact of emerging technologies such as facial recognition.
In addition, we also seek to understand and expose the impacts of dis/misinformation and online abuse, such as ourToxic Twittercampaign which used cutting edge AI/ML tools to measure the extent of violence and abuse against women on Twitter.
In September 2021, Amnesty launched a campaign calling for a ban onsurveillance advertising, striking to the heart of Facebook and Google’s business model. The campaign is part of longer-term work tackling the human rights harms of Big Tech’s surveillance-based business model.
As part of these efforts, we identify opportunities for strategic litigation to secure accountability for human rights abuses arising from the dominance of the big tech firms and their misuse of big data and artificial intelligence.
CensorshipAs many countries introduce sweeping new laws to increase censorship of the internet, Amnesty Tech is at the forefront of the fightback.
For instance, when Google planned to launch a censored search app in China – codenamedProject Dragonfly– we warned it could irreparably damage internet users’ trust in the tech company while setting a dangerous precedent for tech companies enabling rights abuses by governments.
We launched aglobal petitioncalling on Google CEO Sundar Pichai to drop the app, which would blacklist search terms like “human rights” and “Tiananmen Crackdown”.
In November 2018, Google staffpublished an open letterin support of Amnesty International’s campaign for Google to #Drop Dragonfly.
In July 2019, Google said it had “terminated” plans to launch Project Dragonfly. We are continuing to monitor developments and have urged Google to commit to never aiding China’s large-scale censorship and surveillanIf you are talented and passionate about human rights then Amnesty International wants to hear from you.
