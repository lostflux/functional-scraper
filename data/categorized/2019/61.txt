AI NOW 2019 SymposiumOctober 02, 2019NYU Skirball Center, New York, NYThe Growing Pushback Against Harmful AIThe AI Now 2019 Symposium provided behind-the-scenes insights from those at the frontlines of the growing pushback against harmful AI.
Our program featured leading lawyers, organizers, scholars, and tech workers, all of whom have engaged creative strategies to combat exploitative AI systems across a wide range of contexts, from automated allocation of social services, to policing and border control, to worker surveillance and exploitation, and well beyond.
We shared the stories of those at the forefront, drawing on their insight and experience as we work together to ensure that AI is accountable to the people whose lives it most affects.
