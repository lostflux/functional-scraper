However, the adoption of such technologies into clinical pathways has been less examined, and the impacts on users and the broader health system are poorly understood. We sought to address this by studying the impacts of introducing a digitally enabled care pathway for patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) at a tertiary referral hospital in the United Kingdom. A dedicated clinical response team—comprising existing nephrology and patient-at-risk and resuscitation teams—received AKI alerts in real time via Streams, a mobile app. Here, we present a qualitative evaluation of the experiences of users and other health care professionals whose work was affected by the implementation of the care pathway.
Objective:The aim of this study was to qualitatively evaluate the impact of mobile results viewing and automated alerting as part of a digitally enabled care pathway on the working practices of users and their interprofessional relationships.
Methods:A total of 19 semistructured interviews were conducted with members of the AKI response team and clinicians with whom they interacted across the hospital. Interviews were analyzed using inductive and deductive thematic analysis.
Results:The digitally enabled care pathway improved access to patient information and expedited early specialist care. Opportunities were identified for more constructive planning of end-of-life care due to the earlier detection and alerting of deterioration. However, the shift toward early detection also highlighted resource constraints and some clinical uncertainty about the value of intervening at this stage. The real-time availability of information altered communication flows within and between clinical teams and across professional groups.
Conclusions:Digital technologies allow early detection of adverse events and of patients at risk of deterioration, with the potential to improve outcomes. They may also increase the efficiency of health care professionals’ working practices. However, when planning and implementing digital information innovations in health care, the following factors should also be considered: the provision of clinical training to effectively manage early detection, resources to cope with additional workload, support to manage perceived information overload, and the optimization of algorithms to minimize unnecessary alerts.
KeywordsIntroductionBackgroundIn many health systems, the ageing demographic of hospital patients is accompanied by worsening health and a greater need for diverse investigations and treatments. As a result, care pathways are increasingly complex and ever more reliant on access to relevant data and on communication between individuals and multidisciplinary teams [1]. In this context, although adverse events—such as acute kidney injury (AKI), cardiac arrest, or clinical decline which necessitates high-dependency care—are commonly a consequence of the natural history of the underlying disease, they may also occur because of delays in treatment pathways [2]. Evidence suggests that patient outcomes improve where such clinical decline is detected and acted upon early, and substantial effort has been made worldwide in this regard, for instance, through the use oftrack and triggerscoring systems to detect decline [3] or the provision of emergency response teams [4,5]. However, such changes have not been matched by other key components of care delivery: the manner in which health care teams communicate and the manner in which data are accessed and presented. Globally, the most widely used hospital communication system continues to be the pager [6], whereas data are accessed from paper records and a range of disparate and disconnected electronic data repositories. Care might be improved if interpersonal communication were enhanced and if it were possible to readily access data in a form that allowed rapid assessment of the patient’s status.
The introduction of digital technologies offers one potential solution, allowing ready detection of the deteriorating patient, communication among health care workers, and immediate access to patient data in a user-friendly and appropriate format, thus improving outcomes. The embedding of digital technologies into health care is now a priority in the United Kingdom [7] and internationally [8]. However, the adoption of such technologies into health care has been little studied, and the impacts on users and the broader health system are poorly understood. We sought to address these issues by studying the impacts of introducing a digitally enabled care pathway for patients with AKI.
AKI—a sudden reduction in kidney function diagnosed by changes in serum creatinine [9]—is common, appears across multiple care pathways, and is associated with significantly increased mortality, morbidity, and cost of health care [10-15]. However, substantial deficits exist in all key processes of AKI care including early recognition and therapy, appropriate escalation to specialist or critical care services, and follow-up [16]. In an effort to expedite and standardize diagnosis, the National Health Service (NHS) mandated the use of a new diagnostic algorithm in all English hospitals in 2014 [17] and provided guidance as to how the algorithm could be implemented [18]. However, simple alerting to the presence of AKI does not seem to improve outcome [19]. We therefore designed a new care pathway that encompassed AKI detection, mobile alerting of a dedicated response team comprising multiple specialists, and the provision of protocolized care [20]. Evaluation of the implementation of the digitally enabled care pathway with regard to impacts on processes of care, clinical outcome, and the cost of care delivery are described elsewhere [21,22].
ObjectivesWe present a qualitative evaluation of the experiences of users and other health care professionals whose work was affected by the implementation of the new care pathway. We sought to characterize the impacts on staff of such automated alerting, mobile results viewing, and ready communication, with particular focus on their working practices and interprofessional relationships.
MethodsSettingThe digitally enabled pathway was designed and implemented at the Royal Free Hospital (RFH)—a large, acute, tertiary referral hospital providing a range of acute services (including a 34-bed intensive treatment unit and an inpatient nephrology service) in central London, United Kingdom. The care pathway has been described in detail elsewhere [20] and is summarized in brief below.
The Preimplementation Care PathwayBefore making the changes to the care pathway described here, pathology results were viewed by ordering clinicians in batch at the end of the working day using desktop computers. A message linking to local Web-based clinical guidelines was appended to any creatinine result suggestive of AKI in the electronic patient record (EPR), and such results were also communicated to the clinical area by biochemistry staff by telephone. In its early stages, AKI was typically managed independently by general acute care and various specialty teams; specialist input was requested through hospital pagers and telephone communication at the discretion of referring clinical teams.
The Digitally Enabled Care PathwayStreams (DeepMind Technologies Ltd) is a mobile app deployed on iPhone operating system–enabled smartphones. It processes relevant routinely collected clinical and demographic data through secure integration with hospitals’ existing information systems; owing to the need for real-time event-driven data, Health Level Seven (version 2, Health Level Seven International) feeds were used for integration with the laboratory information management system and electronic medical record. It was first registered with the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency as a Class I, nonmeasuring, nonsterile medical device under the European Union Medical Device Directive (1993) on August 30, 2016. Future revisions of the device may be classified at a higher level under the new medical device regulation.
Streams analyzes serum creatinine results immediately and continuously, alerting clinicians in real time to all potential AKI cases as defined by the NHS England AKI algorithm. The app also provides clinicians with data relevant to AKI management, including a graphical trend view of serum creatinine, specific flags for the presence of life-threatening AKI complications (such as hyperkalemia), details of any previous AKI episodes, demographic information, and past medical history from coded Hospital Episode Statistics data. Videos demonstrating Streams functionality can be found on the DeepMind Health support website [23].
AKI alerts are sent in real time to a specialist clinical response team (henceforth, theAKI response team), comprising the RFH’s existingpatient-at-risk and resuscitation team(PARRT) and nephrology team. The PARRT (Clinical Nurse Specialists who review at-risk or deteriorating inpatients) receive alerts on all patients with AKI stages 2 and 3 and are on site 24 hours a day. The nephrology team comprises a renal consultant and specialty registrar, both of whom receive all AKI notifications. The registrar is on site 24 hours a day and is typically the first responder. The consultant can triage alerts through secure remote access if off site, providing clinical supervision and subsequent patient review where needed. Through Streams, the AKI response team triages alerts, communicates with other team members, and documents the outcome of clinical reviews. Relevant contacts and clinical guidance are available on Streams phones.
The AKI response team prioritizes patients for review according to the information available in Streams. Patients with life-threatening complications or deemed at high risk are reviewed immediately, whereas a case review within 2 hours is suggested for all other alerts. Upon review, a care protocol (based on existing best practice guidelines [24,25]) is annotated and entered into the patient’s paper notes alongside an advisory sticker for key nursing actions (Multimedia Appendix 1).
Although the nephrology team occasionally takes over patient care, overall responsibility for care rests with patients’ primary teams. AKI recovery is monitored remotely in-app. Realerting for AKI that has not recovered is enabled 48 hours after the first alert. However, worsening of AKI stage or the development of a new complication (eg, hyperkalemia) at any time results in a further notification. Follow-up reviews are undertaken by the AKI response team according to clinical judgement. A diagram outlining the pre- and postintervention care pathways is provided inFigure 1. Although clinical guidelines and specialist response teams existed before the new care pathway, the goals of implementation of the care pathway were to improve the reliability and speed at which AKI recognition and appropriate specialist review occurred.
ImplementationBefore deployment, Streams users attended training events and accessed a video users’ guide to both the Streams app and the clinical pathway. Feedback from the AKI response team was gathered during a 16-week pathway optimization period (January-May 2017), during which key adjustments to the Streams app and associated clinical pathway were made. The optimized care pathway has been deployed continuously at RFH since May 2017.
Data CollectionWe undertook an exploratory case study approach to understand the implementation of Streams within a single site. Data collected included in-depth semistructured interviews and brief nonparticipant observations. The interview guide (included in theMultimedia Appendix 1) was developed by the research team, which included physicians with extensive experience in clinical nephrology and intensive care medicine and experts in health services research. Interviews explored the impacts of the care pathway on staff members and the care delivered to patients, with a particular focus on working practices and interprofessional relationships. Face-to-face interviews began 1 month after the start of the pathway optimization period and were spaced throughout a 16-month period of implementation and evaluation (February 2017 to May 2018). Purposive sampling was employed following a key informant strategy [26] that identified individuals with important roles in the environment under study who had expert knowledge to share impartially. A sample size of 20 is typical for a case study such as this, in line with both international consensus guidance and common practice in qualitative research [27-29]. Furthermore, the total number of users involved in providing the care pathway was small, which necessarily restricted the number of interviews that could be conducted. A list of potential respondents was drawn up to ensure representation from both groups in the AKI response team (ie, PARRT and nephrology teams) and clinicians from the wider hospital community affected by the care pathway, as well as a diverse range of clinical experience and level of comfort with mobile technologies. A total of 20 respondents were approached and 19 consented. In total, 8 PARRT nurses (5band 7and 3band 8or above) and 8 nephrologists (4 registrars and 4 consultants) were interviewed from the AKI response team. Of the respondents, 3 (2 consultant physicians and 1 medical registrar) from the wider hospital community were selected as a result of their frequent interactions with the AKI response team. Interviews were conducted by the lead researcher (AC). Each respondent was interviewed once. Respondents were informed that the interviewer was from a university and that the research was independent of the RFH. Field observations were undertaken during the first 4 weeks of the pathway optimization period. For these, the lead researcher observed user behavior in the emergency department and in inpatient wards during day and evening shifts using extensive note-taking to document users’ interaction with the Streams app and impacts on working practices and interprofessional relationships.
Data AnalysisData were analyzed using a combination of inductive and deductive thematic analysis techniques [30]. First, quotes from each interview were arranged into a matrix (Multimedia Appendix 1) in which rows represented individual respondents and columns represented categories that aligned to the basic principles of the intervention pathway (for example, the triage of AKI alerts). The matrix was populated by 2 researchers (AC and GB) who independently analyzed the entire dataset. Researchers met regularly to critique and challenge each other’s allocations; these were in turn reviewed with the lead researcher (RR), a process that enabled us to compare different professional groups’ perspectives and identify discordant views. The group then synthesized new descriptive codes based on emergent themes in the matrix (for example, the impact of real-time information availability) and assigned the quotes to these. Discordant quotes that challenged these themes were routinely sought and discussed. Additional independent oversight was provided by the lead researcher who identified additional quotes of relevance and refined the final themes. We employed the principle ofkeynessin our analysis [31], drawing out novel issues that might be generalizable and relevant to the adoption of digital health products in clinical practice (for example, how mobile working tools impact established clinical workflows). Our results present representative quotes for each theme, the titles of which were iterated through the writing process. We therefore took both a descriptive and an interpretive approach to analysis, first understanding how the intervention was used and how it affected clinical practice, then considering the intervention in terms of cultural practices and overarchingmeta-themesabout mobile app use.
Ethical ApprovalThe digitally enabled care pathway constituted a new standard service at RFH. Plans for the evaluation of the digitally enabled care pathway were independently reviewed by the University College London Joint Research Office. They directed that this study fell under the remit of service evaluation (rather than research), as per guidance from the NHS Health Research Authority [32]. As such, the service evaluation was registered locally with the RFH audit lead and medical director, and no participant consent was required. An independent data monitoring committee (which included a patient member) reviewed all analyses before preparation for publication. A full list of committee members is provided in theMultimedia Appendix 1.
ResultsAlthough interviews focused on the deployment of a pathway for patients with AKI, they also sought to more broadly characterize the impacts of automated alerting, mobile results viewing, and ready communication on staff, with a particular focus on their working practices and interprofessional relationships. In this respect, 3 central themes emerged.
Theme 1: The Impact of Real-Time Information AvailabilityThis theme relates to respondents’ experiences of the benefits and drawbacks of real-time mobile access to patient data. The app provided automated alerts about patients’ kidney function and gave staff access to current and historical information, such as previous pathology and coded diagnoses. These functions were reported to save valuable time among participants from both teams:This in turn expedited rapid intervention for deteriorating patients, wherever they were in the hospital:Participants in both teams found alerts to be particularly valuable for patients whose lead consultant was not a physician:The provision of results and real-time clinical alerts and team communication via mobile phones introduced workload for clinicians in a new modality. Overall, experienced clinicians were able to integrate AKI alerts into their existing duties, discriminating between high- and low-priority cases and using this information to adjust their current priorities:However, some more junior clinicians in both teams felt that the pathway created additional workload and suggested that clinical review might not be deliverable to all patients by the AKI response team as configured currently:Others pointed out that the added burden of the app was related to the volume offalse positivealerts produced by the mandated NHS AKI algorithm:Some respondents from the nephrology team pointed out that although important information was now more readily available, this created additional anxiety because it was not clear who was primarily responsible for delivering timely care. Once again, the need to expand the responsive workforce was suggested as a way to mitigate the workload-associated stress:In summary, although the digitally enabled care pathway was widely valued for increasing efficient access to patient information, thus facilitating better care, some respondents reported increased workload and anxiety.
Theme 2: The Implications of Early DetectionThe digitally enabled care pathway was designed to expedite identification of AKI so as to avoid deterioration and improve outcomes, meaning that staff who normally respond to critically unwell patients would now also attend patients at lower risk. There was a divergence of opinion among members of the AKI response team about the rationale for this approach. Respondents in both teams pointed out that the AKI algorithm identified deteriorating patients at an earlier stage than was possible through other means:Others emphasized the benefits of early recognition for patient health and in terms of reducing the complexity of required interventions:However, some respondents in the nephrology team did not see the point of being alerted to low-risk patients:Some respondents in this team also pointed out that early identification could not necessarily be aligned to early intervention because of a lack of knowledge with respect to appropriate management:Thus, the shift toward earlier detection highlights the need to consider the resources required to manage both early and late disease and the training needed to enable clinicians to effectively intervene at an earlier stage.
Theme 3: Behavioral Effects of the Care PathwayThe final theme demonstrates how real-time data provision affected relationships between users of the digital intervention and the broader health system with which the users interacted, together with how these changes impacted upon beliefs, behaviors, and care delivery. These are described in 3 subcategories below.
First, the digital care pathway affected behaviorswithinclinical teams in a number of ways. An immediate benefit was the use of mobile phones for team communication, experienced by members of both teams:However, a disadvantage was also identified: junior members of the nephrology team do not currently use the Streams app. Unequal access to patient data occasionally reversed the usual direction of communication of information from junior doctor to consultant, which some consultants suggested impeded learning opportunities:In addition, the visualization of each other’s triage decisions within the app (a feature specifically requested by users) revealed the hitherto unrecognized variations that exist in professional judgements. Respondents in both teams raised the fact that knowledge of others’ decisions sometimes confused rather than clarified the clinical decision-making processes of colleagues:Second, the digital pathway had an impact on relationshipsbetweenclinical teams. Several members of the nephrology team were uncomfortable about providing a clinical opinion when not solicited by the clinicians primarily responsible for that patient’s care:However, there was an indication among several members of the PARRT team that this concern might be limited to communication between different specialty doctors:This is relevant because the type of information available also changed the professional group with whom this team directly liaised:Third, the care pathway had an impact on the relationship between clinicians and their patients. In particular, several PARRT team members described that alerts identified patients at an earlier stage of AKI than was the case through established clinical pathways (eg, monitoring of vital signs). This may have led to an unexpected and evolving role for some members of the team. Several respondents described how the care pathway enabled them to help patients make informed decisions surrounding end-of-life care. For example:DiscussionPrincipal FindingsQualitative and quantitative results from our mixed-methods service evaluation suggest that the digitally enabled care pathway has positive impacts on patient care [21,22]. Here, we demonstrated the ability to intervene in the treatment of deteriorating patients more quickly and the opportunity for earlier, more constructive end-of-life planning. The ability to integrate mobile results viewing into existing clinical workflows also appears to increase efficiency through the immediate access to specific and contextual information. However, this comes at a price, particularly for some junior staff, in terms of anxiety associated with increasing numbers ofprioritypatients and information overload, in part exacerbated by false positive alerts. We also highlight the hitherto unrecognized need to ensure that relevant clinical specialties include training in prevention if we are to optimize the value of digital innovations that promote early intervention. These findings suggest that the true cost-effectiveness of such innovations cannot be assessed until the balance between early intervention leading to better outcomes and increased workload is ascertained. Maximization of utility also requires finding the most appropriate balance between sensitivity and specificity for clinical alerts. This can be difficult to achieve: although it is recognized that the NHS England AKI algorithm produces false positives, some argue that this is a necessary trade-off for enhanced sensitivity [33].
Strengths and LimitationsThis evaluation has a number of strengths. First, it benefits from the diversity of our respondent sample, presenting multiple perspectives on the intervention based on cultural differences between different professionals and teams. Second, the robust analysis uncovered issues that are likely to be generalizable to the implementation of other digital technologies in health care. Finally, our analysis team includes researchers from medical, public health, and psychology backgrounds, creating trustworthiness by encouraging debate and multidisciplinary interpretation.
Our evaluation has a number of limitations. First, we initiated interviews during thepathway optimizationperiod to enable us to gather insights that would improve the pathway itself. However, interviews at this early stage may have been more prone to include negative feedback before users were used to the changes described. The period in which interviews were conducted did not allow us to assess whether perceptions of the care pathway changed over time. Second, interviews were conducted in a single clinical setting. Although our methods allowed us to identify theactive ingredientsof a digital intervention in an acute setting with communication systems familiar to health care teams worldwide, the magnitude of the efficiency benefits reported may vary according to the digital maturity of the health care environment studied.
Comparison With Prior WorkFew studies of AKI alerting systems have been previously described. Alavijeh et al [34] used a questionnaire to assess satisfaction with a new automated AKI warning system among physicians working in primary care. The questionnaire used was limited to questions about respondents’ knowledge of the existence of the alert system, perceptions of its utility, and impact on practice, making comparisons with our findings difficult. However, in common with our findings, many respondents found the alert systemvaluable. Kanagasundam et al [35] examined the effects of an interruptive AKI clinical decision support system (embedded within an EPR system) through a series of semistructured interviews with stakeholders. Themes revealed were similar to those encountered in the generic clinical decision support literature, namely, alert fatigue and user dissatisfaction with mandatory interactions. Although respondents in Kanagasundam’s evaluation believed that the alerts led to earlier patient assessment, some clinicians found them to be aninsult to their knowledge. A major reason for dismissing alerts was users’ need to review a comprehensive dataset (including historical creatinine) at the point of alert. We overcame this limitation by including a curated summary of relevant clinical data in-app at the point of alert. Kanagasundam et al also reported that the impression that the alert system prioritized sensitivity over specificity limited perceived credibility for some users. Our evaluation also demonstrated the presence of both uncertainties and variations in professional judgement among specialists, as to what changes in serum creatinine were clinically significant. In addition, respondents in our evaluation were occasionally unsure as to whether clinical intervention was warranted, even for cases where the AKI alert was perceived to be genuine. Bevan’s [36] exploration of the impact of a clinical decision support system for AKI embedded within a single hospital’s EPR found that alerts were unpopular because of their interruption to the established workflows. We were able to avoid this problem through the separation of alerts from the hospital’s EPR so that mobile working allowed users to integrate alert reviews into their routine working practice. Our finding that mobile working tools are integrated into clinicians’ workflow is pertinent given that junior medical staff currently spend almost half their working day using desktop computers [37]. Finally, the survey by Oh et al [38] of provider acceptance of automated electronic alerts for AKI demonstrated that approval of alerts was positively correlated with the belief that such alerts improved patient care and negatively correlated with the belief that alerts did not provide any novel information. The overall odds of approval decreased over time. Thus, the success of deploying clinical alerts is dependent on clinicians’ perceptions of their relevance. This tallies with our finding of diverse opinions about the value of low risk alerts. A number of mixed-methods analyses of electronic alerting systems for AKI are still underway; results from the qualitative segments of theAcute Kidney Outreach to Reduce Deterioration and Death[39] andTackling AKI[40] studies are awaited.
ConclusionsOur results are relevant to the design and evaluation of care pathways that involve automated alerts, mobile working, or the early deployment of specialist care. Such innovations will increasingly emerge with the application of machine learning [41,42] to early diagnosis and disease prediction. Our findings suggest that alerting systems aiming to encourage early or preventive action will achieve buy-in from health care professionals if they believe in the clinical and cost-effectiveness of the intervention, feel equipped to respond, understand clearly what their responsibilities are, and feel empowered to act. Training in prioritization of information is needed to balance the planned benefits of real-time access to mobile data with the cognitive load this will produce; digitally enabled pathways should be designed so that the most appropriate clinician is able to access the right data at the right time. E-alerting or the early deployment of a specialist resource may also have an impact on other clinical teams affected by implementation; future evaluations should seek to further explore this. Finally, the inevitable introduction of digital technology to health care is more likely to improve both patient outcomes and working practices if aligned with a commitment to proactively identify and address concomitant, and sometimes unexpected, sequelae.
