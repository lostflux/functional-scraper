Terra Nova: Timing of partial melting and granulite formation during the genesis of high to ultra-high temperature terranes: Insight from numerical experimentsLong-lived high to ultra-high temperature (HT-UHT) granulitic terranes formed throughout Earth’s history. Yet, the detailed processes involved in their formation re- main unresolved and notably the sequence of appearance and duration of migmatisa- tion and granulites conditions in the orogenic cycle. These processes can be evaluated by analytical and numerical models. First, solving the steady-state …Read more…Ben Mather wins People’s Choice Award at #AuScope2021 Conference for volcano videoBen Mather won the People’s Choice Award at the recent #AuScope2021 Conference for his fantastic presentation explaining the evolution of seafloor volcanoes off the eastern Australian coast. Watch it here.
Continental arcs dominate global chemical weatheringEarth’s plate-tectonic activity regulates the carbon cycle and, hence, climate, via volcanic outgassing and silicate-rock weather- ing. Mountain building, arc–continent collisions and clustering of continents in the tropics have all been invoked as controlling the weathering flux, with arcs also acting as a major contributor of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. However, these processes have …Read more…Geodynamic models link enigmatic intraplate volcanism in Eastern Asia to subduction history and upper mantle upwellingsIn Eastern Asia, Jurassic and Cretaceous intraplate volcanism and magmatism differ in their spatial distribution and composition. A combination of plate kinematic and geodynamic models provides clues for their causes.
Chatting about reconstructing 1 billion years of Earth evolution in Geology Bites podcastIn the latest Geology Bites podcast series, Dietmar Muller talks about the challenges and benefits of reconstructing Earth evolution over a billion years with Oliver Strimpel, former astrophysicist and museum director, and Visiting Professor at the Department of Earth Sciences at Oxford University. https://www.geologybites.com/A global dataset of present-day oceanic crustal age and seafloor spreading parametersAbstract: We present an updated oceanic crustal age grid and a set of complementary grids including spreading rate, asymmetry, direction and obliquity. Our dataset is based on a selected set of magnetic anomaly identifications and the plate tectonic model of Müller et al. (2019). We find the mean age of oceanic crust is 64.2 Myrs, …Read more…Kinematic and geodynamic evolution of the Isthmus of Panama region: Implications for Central American Seaway closureAbstract: A major topic of debate in Earth and climate science surrounds the timing of closure of the Central American Seaway. While it is clear that the gateway was closed by ~2.8 Ma, recent studies based on geological and marine molecular evidence have suggested an earlier closing time of early to mid-Miocene. Here, we examine …Read more…Sea level fluctuations driven by changes in global ocean basin volume following supercontinent break-upAbstract: Long-term variations in eustatic sea level in an ice-free world, which existed through most of the Mesozoic and early Cenozoic eras, are partly driven by changes in the volume of ocean basins. Previous studies have determined ocean basin volume changes from plate tectonic reconstructions since the Mesozoic; however, these studies have not considered a …Read more…A Quantitative Tomotectonic Plate Reconstruction of Western North America and the Eastern Pacific BasinAbstract: Plate reconstructions since the breakup of Pangaea are mostly based on the preserved spreading history of ocean basins, within absolute reference frames that are constrained by a combination of age-progressive hotspot tracks and palaeomagnetic data. The evolution of destructive plate margins is difficult to constrain from surface observations as much of the evidence has …Read more…Muller et al.

The question is: what triggered these long-term climate cycles?
