Videos Machine Learning Is Everywhere, But What Is It Exactly? August 28, 2017 25919 From Google’s language translation app to autonomous cars, machine learning has become a key ingredient in multiple areas of our lives—but what exactly is it? In the simplest sense, machine learning is a method of computer data analysis that learns from its own experience. Once a machine learning algorithm learns what specific patterns look like, it can apply the knowledge on a vast scale. For example, a fraud detection machine learning algorithm may miss a few false charges initially, but once it identifies the pattern, it can protect against millions of future attacks.
Check out this week’s episode of Tech-x-planations to learn more about the basics of machine learning.
