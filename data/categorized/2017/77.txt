The control scheme inHalo Wars.
In theHalo Warscampaign, players command armies ofUNSCunits during its first encounters against the Covenant, a collection of alien races that threatens to wipe out all of humanity. With the guidance of theAISerinaof the CFV-88UNSCSpirit of Fire, the player leads UNSC soldiers and vehicles against classic Covenant foes such asUnggoy,Sangheili,Ghosts, andBanshees. Each faction has its own strengths and abilities in battle.
Thecampaignconsists of fifteen levels which tell the story ofHalo Wars.
PlotHarvest, just after theUNSCSpirit of Firearrived in the system.
The game is set in 2531[4]and focuses around theMarineforces of theUNSCSpirit of Fireas they engage Covenant ground forces after the discovery of an ancient artifact during a journey to the partiallyglassedHarvest.
The story begins withCaptain Cutterrecounting the UNSC's early battles on Harvest through pre-rendered CGI scenes. Cutter then deploys UNSC forces to the planet's surface to reinforceSergeant ForgeatAlpha Base. While Sergeant Forge is patrolling the northern regions, Alpha Base is attacked and destroyed by the Covenant, with survivors fleeing to the surrounding the areas. Rounding up these survivors, Forge then leads them in an assault to remove the Covenant presence and return Alpha Base to operational status.
[5]During a patrol, Forge discovers aForerunner relicoccupied by Covenant forces. He then leads an assault to remove the Covenant so thatProfessor Andersmay examine it. Upon contact from Anders, the relic points to anotherUEGcolony world,Arcadia, which holds "something of great interest to the Covenant." The examination is cut short when a Covenant counter-attack cuts them off from Alpha Base and pins them at the site.
[6]The Spirit of Fire deploys Grizzly tanks to cut through the Covenant and link up with Forge and his Marines, escorting them back out through the relic while forces from Alpha Base held off the Covenant. Professor Anders then convinces Captain Cutter to travel to Arcadia using information gathered from the Harvest relic.
[7]Following the Covenant to Arcadia, they find that the most of the orbital defense ships have been either destroyed or damaged in battle with the Covenant (one of the many ships is theUNSC Pillar of Autumnwhich would be involved in the "Halo incident" twenty years later). Sergeant Forge and his forces deploy to the surface in order to assist the Spartans fromRed Teamin the effort to evacuate civilians fromArcadia Cityvia cargo transports.
[8]Afterward, UNSC forces withdraw to a defensible area on the city outskirts, holding off Covenant attacks long enough forSpartan Group Omegato arrive and assist in the destruction of local Covenant forces.
[9]Meanwhile, the Covenant have erected a large energy shield generator around a site of importance containing severalForerunner ruins, forcing the UNSC to deploy prototypeRhinoplasma artillery to penetrate it.
[10]Moving in to examine what was of such interest to the Covenant, they come under attack from a Super Scarab, only partially complete that annihilates any UNSC forces in its line of sight. Eventually managing to destroy it, Anders and Forge begin documenting the area, only for theArbiter Ripa 'Morameeto arrive, taking Anders prisoner and wounding Sergeant Forge, with Red Team arriving too late to assist.
[11]As the Covenant and captured Anders rapidly head out of the system the Spirit of Fire is forced to pursue, eventually emerging in orbit over amysterious planetin an unknown location.
Deploying ground forces to search for Anders, the UNSC and Covenant forces come under attack from a previously undiscovered alien organism - the Flood.
[12]Managing to regroup and hold a defensible location, UNSC forces follow Anders' signal and manage to locate the source - an apparent body of water.
[13]The water suddenly splits to reveal an entrance andSentinelsemerge to deal with the Flood.
[14]The Spirit of Fire is then locked in a field and pulled into the opening. At the same time UNSC forces withdraw back to the Spirit of Fire from a concentrated Flood force, narrowly escaping annihilation. As the Spirit of Fire enters the planet's interior it is guided through a docking system that removes Flood growths from the ship's hull. This occurs as the ship moves through a system of concentric rings that filter out Flood biomass.
[15]The Spirit of Fire then emerges inside a massiveShield World, immediately engaging aCovenant Destroyerand fending off attacks while conducting repairs.
[16]Meanwhile, The Arbiter uses Anders to activateThe Apex site, revealing a fleet of Forerunner warships which the Covenant plans to incorporate into their existing naval forces to crush the humans quickly and with ease. With the Covenant forces distracted by their new fleet, Anders manages to escape, using what had been her stasis prison as a translocation device. She teleports to the surface of the Shield World's interior, linking up with Forge and his Marines, who clear the area of Covenant forces and establish a base of operations.
[17]Learning of the Forerunner ships, the crew remove the Spirit of Fire'sFTL Reactorplanning to detonate it - the chain-reaction sending the Shield World's sun into a supernova. Though risky, the plan would destroy both the installation and the fleet, denying it to the Covenant and saving humanity from near total defeat and extinction. The Arbiter attempts to stop them, but hisHonor Guardsare killed by Red Team, and Forge himself manages to kill the Arbiter with one of his own Energy Swords.
[18]Arbiter Ripa 'Moramee meets his demise in the Shield World.
With the reactor damaged, Forge stays behind to detonate it manually, while the rest of the UNSC forces activate a portal to escape the Shield World and retreat to the Spirit of Fire. Once evacuations are complete, Cutter maneuvers the ship to slingshot around the sun to build up enough speed to escape the supernova's blast radius and the range of the Shield World's debris.
[19]Now unable to return to UNSC space with the speed an FTL drive would have afforded them, the Spirit of Fire's crew enter cryonics storage. The ship begins its long journey home, likely to take many years or decades. In a final cutscene, Sgt. Forge's cryo tube is closed by Captain Cutter, who briefly nods, upon which the camera pans down to find the words "Sgt. J. Forge," acknowledging his sacrifice for all of humanity.
In the final moments of the credits, Serina speaks the final words of the game, saying "Captain. Wake up. Something has happened," As the logo appears on the screen.
The ultimate fate of theSpirit of Fireis unknown. Investigations by the UNSC and ONI are officially closed a few years after it is officially designated MIA, but there is some evidence that the ship does at some point return to UNSC space, with the strongest argument being the number of Spartans present during theFall of Reach; At the time, 25 of the remaining 28 are present on the planet, with the three missing identified asGray Teamand the remaining dead or missing all previously identified, leading credence to the idea that Red Team, do eventually reunite with the UNSC. However it is noted that sinceSpirit of Fire's crew were the first humans to encounter the Flood, information should have been reported to ONI, but the first recorded Human-Flood encounter was in 2552, 21 years later, on Halo Installation 04, meaning that either theSpirit of Firedid not come back or ONI kept the 2531 Human-Flood encounter a closely guarded secret.
CharactersTheSpirit of Fireis "full of new characters," such as the AI Serina,Professor Ellen Anders,SergeantJohn Forge, and theSpirit of Fire's commander,Captain James Cutter.
[20]Some of these characters go planetside to aid the player. Aside from CGI cut scenes and on-the-battlefield appearances, characters inHalo Warsoften appear in talking head animations where a small view screen appears in the upper left corner showing the face of the character speaking at the moment.
UNSCCovenantOtherThroughout the game several other characters are either mentioned or seen.

The Flood gain units by taking overHumanand Covenant troops.
FloodInfection Forms,Combat Forms, andCarrier Formsare the Flood's main attack force. In the February issue ofGamePro, it was confirmed that there would be new Flood forms inHalo Wars. These include the Bomber, Swarm, and Thrasher Forms. Though they cannot be controlled, in the multiplayer mapRelease, they can be released at opposite ends of the map to menace enemy unitsIn respect to keeping the appearance of the Flood in canon with the rest of the series, the game has theSpirit of Firetraveling back to Earth at speeds slower than light after its mission had ended, making it impossible for them to report the existence of the Flood. However, this raises further controversy over the presence of the Spartans on board theSpirit of Fire.
Ground FormsAir FormsBuildingsGameplayTechnology AdvancementThroughout the campaign and in Skirmishes, the player must advance their technology in order to increase their army's power. When technology is increased, more units, upgrades, and buildings become available. For instance, infantry units can receive additional members or stronger weaponry. Field Armories or Temples (and the upgrades within them) can become available with increased technology as well.
The tech tree is different for the two playable factions. When playing as the UNSC, the player advances by building and upgradingreactors. The Covenant moves through the tech-tree inAgesby purchasing upgrades at the leader temple; players can advance to theAges of Doubtand theAges of Reclamationrespectively. Players can also advance by capturingForerunner Bonus Reactors.
When a Reactor is built or an Age is researched, OR a Bonus Reactor is claimed, the tech number on the top right of the screen goes up. If, say, a reactor is destroyed, the number goes down. Different buildings, units, and upgrades require different tech levels to use.
Veterancy PointsVeterancy points increases a unit's statistics, such as attack, attack speed, defense, etc. This number can be calculated by counting how many stars a unit has above their health bar. This is the number of veterancy points said unit has. The stars, orVeterancy Points. are acquired only after a unit or a group of units have defeated enemy structures, units, vehicles, or other combat related situations. They are also gained by upgrading the unit. A unit has a maximum of 3 stars, except a Spartan-Commandeered vehicle, which has a maximum of 14 "Veterancy Points" for Tanks/Grizzlies and Hornets/Hawks. All other Spartan-Commandeered vehicles have a maximum of 13 "Veterancy Points." Some special player units in campaign mode (example:ODSTsin the levelAnders' Signal) that have a maximum of 5Veterancy Points. A mist effect appears briefly over a unit when it gains a veterancy point, though this is hard to see unless closely watching the unit. When a unit gains more veterancy it grows stronger; for example it can take over 4 MAC rounds to destroy a 14 veterancy scorpion. However under special conditions the maximum number of veterancy stars is 17.
Leader AbilitiesCertain characters belonging to both the Covenant and the UNSC have been confirmed to be "leader factions," which are sub-factions with unique units and bonuses. All of the Covenant leaders appear on the battlefield and have unique in-game abilities. The UNSC leaders on the other hand do not appear on the battlefield but instead have economic bonuses and "super units" (upgrades of normal units). Currently known leaders areCaptain James Cutter,Sergeant John Forge, ProfessorEllen Anders,Ripa 'Moramee,Thrallslayerand theProphet of Regret. Each leader has a number of unique features, for the UNSC it's "super units," economic bonuses, unique units (Cutter's Elephant, Forge's Cyclops and Anders' Gremlin.) and leader powers (ODSTDrop/MAC Blast, Carpet bomb and Cryo bomb, respectively to leaders stated previously) that can be called from theSpirit of Fire. The Covenant on the other hand have a unique unit (two for Thrallslayer) and a "hero unit" (their leader) with their leader power attached to the "hero unit." The Prophet of Regret's ability is to glass enemy forces (known as the "Cleansing Beam" inHalo Wars), which causes significant damage to both structures and units, however it also drains resources while active. His unique units areSangheili Honor Guardsmen. Ripa Moramee's leader power is "Rage Mode," which can empower nearby friendly units, but at the cost of draining resources for every second this mode is active. He can also upgrade to infinitely cloak himself.
[35]Ripa Moramee will also have the ability to train suicide Unggoys. Thrallslayer can use hisGravity Hammerto create a vortex which sucks in infantry, then the player can press the A button to create a massive explosion. Thrallslayer's unique units are a pair of Jiralhanae wielding Brute shots (which can be upgraded to have jet packs) and theChopper.
Although Covenant leaders are limited to one unit at a time, they are some of the strongest units in the entire game and are immune to stun effects.
UNSC Leader PowersBlack BoxesBlack boxes are a new feature in the game. Black Boxes are collectibles in theHalo Warscampaign that when collected, they add new events in theHalo Wars Timeline. They look like black boxes with yellow stripes on them and can be picked up by any unit. When you collect one you can just resign straight away and you will still have it. The timeline covers many of the important events from the games and the novels. There is only one black box on each level in the game.
Cut ContentA concept of a Covenant mining facility cut from the final game.
Six units, the UNSCCougar, UNSCFox Cannon,Covenant Air Artillery, CovenantGorgon, the UNSCFalcon, and the UNSCLeviathanwere under development early in the game along with the ability to actually construct individual buildings. The developers later announced that these units been cut, as they had decided to focus on more recognizableHalounits and simpler gameplay.
Before Ensemble conceived the idea forThe Apex, the storyline was supposed to feature a Covenant mining asteroid that was located at aForerunnerore refining mechanism. This concept tries to show the scale of the large Forerunner machinery in place with machines that are still operational, although now controlled by the Covenant. In the end the mining aspect of the story was removed from the game.
[38]Ambient life forms were planned to be encountered during gameplay.
[39]Examples include theSpace Owl, theHarvest Whale, theArctic Beast,Ice Houndand some sort ofeel-snake creaturethat has yet to be named.
MultiplayerCovenantforces engage humans on the levelChasms.
Halo Warssupports voice communication, online leaderboards, and up to six players. Vehicle and unit armor will change to the color of the player. Players are able to achieve the ranks of Recruit, Lieutenant, Major, Commander, Colonel, Brigadier, and General.
MapsEach multiplayer map takes place on a different "world," each with its own musical theme and playlist.
[40]The Halo Rings won't be in the story, but may be included in future maps for multiplayer.

When you lose a base, the population limit goes down by 10.
Strategic Options Add-on PackThe Strategic Options Add-on pack was released on the Xbox Live Market place for 800 Microsoft points. It contains 3 newgametypesSoundtrackEnsemble Studios began recording the music for the game in March 2008, with Ensemble's Music and Sound Director, Stephen Rippy, flying to Prague for the orchestral and choral parts and to Seattle for the piano and mixing.
[45][46][47]Additional music was composed by his long-time collaborator and game Audio Lead Kevin McMullan. It was recorded inPrague, Czech Republicby 45 members of the FILMHarmonic Orchestra and a 21 voice choir at CNSO Studio No. 1.
[48][49]The score was released as a single CD package with a bonus DVD containing additional tracks, 5.1 surround sound mixes of some cues and a behind the scenes video showing the recording sessions of the Halo Warsmain themeand various trailers for the game.
[50]It was also put up for retail as a digital download over iTunes and Sumthing Digital.
[51][52]The response to the score was almost universally enthusiastic, with most critics praisingStephen Rippy's taking the series into new stylistic territory while still paying homage to and reworking classic themes and ideas.
[53][54][55]Marketing Promotions and ReleaseThe game was featured at the 2008 E3 event, held in July. It was shown on G4's E3 08 LIVE, showing a hands-on demo.
[56]Some newer off-screen demos were released, showing how the controls work and how battles proceed.
[57]Alpha TestA screenshot taken of an Alpha playtester.
An Alpha test was done forHalo Wars,[47]concluding during May 2008. The test was open only to several thousand Microsoft employees, includingBungie Studios, in order to locate any bugs or glitches, and to test its performance over Xbox Live. It consisted of a brief "tutorial" and multiplayer, and was "limited to a specific set of units.
" It is unknown how long the Alpha test was conducted, or when it began.
[58]During the Alpha test, anti-air units were glitching so that their effectiveness was lessened, andScorpion tanksand aircraft were extremely powerful. Aircraft strength was lessened to prevent players from sending in air-strikes against the enemyCommand Centerand crippling them too easily, ruining many a protocol player's chances of victory.
[40]This actually isn't an element of the game, but in fact a "balance issue."DemoOn February 5, a demo forHalo Warswas released on Xbox Live for Xbox Live Gold Subscribers. The demo was made available to non-Gold subscribers on February 12. The demo also set a record for the most downloaded demo in one day.
TrailersE3 2008 TrailerFive Long Yearsis aHalo Warscinematic preview released on the July 14th of 2008 depicting the five year long struggle to reclaim Harvest from the Covenant, as well as being the first cutscene for the game.

Field Trip To HarvestField Trip To Harvestis a cinematic preview that was released to the public on October 3, 2008 showing the UNSC's retaking of the planet Harvest and the Covenant's finding of a Forerunner structure. Also, in the conversation between a Zealot and the Arbiter, there is mention of "the Infection." This was speculated to be an introduction to theFloodinHalo Warsbefore the release of the game, but because no Flood were encountered on Harvest, it is almost certainly just a name for the Humans on Harvest.
The Call To BattleThe Call to Battle is a collection of already known cinematics, but it also shows some campaign maps. You can also see that you can make a lot more units than in the demo.
Unknown Trailer VideoOn February 8, 2009, the Taiwanese Xbox Live website released a four-minute-long trailer which contained spoilers detailing the later story ofHalo Wars.
