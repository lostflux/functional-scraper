12 May 2011Tower cranes in placeTower cranes at each of the four corners of the Seismic Isolation Pit will be used to lower the tons of steel rebar needed for the reinforced foundations of the Tokamak Complex.
05 May 2011A last bit of blastingFinal "profile" blasting is carried out in May on the contours of the Tokamak Complex Seismic Isolation Pit.
05 May 2011Dealing with geological particularitiesKarsts, or small cracks in the geological surface of the Seismic Pit, are cleaned, inspected, enlarged, and filled with concrete.
29 April 2011The Seismic Pit in April 2011Work continues on the floor of the Seismic Pit to explore and widen karsts - or fissures - in the first five metres of rock.
29 April 2011Green banks belowThe green banks of the ITER platform, planted last year with over 3.5 tonnes of seeds, stand out against a grey April sky. A lone digger works to create a staircase to lead from the contractors' area below to the worksites on the platform.
28 April 2011Blasting for the Hot Cell FacilityLess profound than the main work site, the square area that abuts the Tokamak Complex Seismic Isolation Pit to the north is reserved for the foundations of the ITER Hot Cell Facility. Final trim blasting will be carried out in May 2011 to finalize the perimeters of this area.

Photo: Altivue/Spie Batignolles17 April 2011Concrete produced on siteTo produce the estimated 250,000 m³ of concrete necessary for the construction of the ITER facilities, a specially dedicated concrete batching plant was built on site. Here: the two mixing machines, each with four tanks. Photo: AIF13 April 2011As heavy as the Empire State BuildingSome 360,000 tonnes of foundation and building will rest on the bottom of the Seismic Isolation Pit; 360,000 tonnes is the weight of New York's Empire State Building. Photo: F4E10 March 2011Steel mesh for safetyWorkers secure steel mesh for the stabilization of rock faces. Photo: F4E10 March 2011Checking the geometry of the excavationLaser and land surveyor rods are used to measure the surface levelling before foundation work begins. The technique of microgravity is used to measure gravity variations in order to determine rock properties. Photo: F4E10 March 2011Making sure the level surface is perfectOn the clean-swept floor of the Seismic Pit, land surveyors' instruments are used to verify the exactness of the levelling operations. Photo: F4E10 March 2011Safety mesh installed along the rock faceWorkers rappel down the walls of the Seismic Isolation Pit to install wire mesh along the rock face as a protective measure for those working below. The horizontal rock surface of the 90 x 130 metre Tokamak Complex Seismic Isolation Pit is as smooth as a billiard table. Photo: F4E10 March 2011ITER will be a busy placeAt the peak of ITER construction in 2014-2015, 5,000 people are expected on the ITER site, up from 1,400 in 2011. The projected rise is due to a sharp increase in the number of construction workers on the platform.
03 March 2011Seventeen metres below the surface of the platformThe final excavation phase now involves "milling" the rock in order to achieve a perfectly flat surface, on which to commence the construction of the lower basemat. Photo: F4E24 February 2011The last sweeping operationsMesh is installed in the background as the last gravel is swept from the floor of the Tokamak Complex Seismic Isolation Pit. Photo: F4E24 February 2011Next step: the blinding layer of concretePrecise measuring instruments are used to create the level surface required for the anti-seismic installation of the Tokamak Complex. Next step: the pouring of a thin, "blinding" layer of concrete to have a perfectly smooth work surface. Photo: F4E24 February 2011Mesh protectionThe rock face is draped with protective steel mesh as the last diggers, scrapers and dumpers prepare the Seismic Pit for the concrete pourers to move in. Photo: F4E24 February 2011The future home of the ITER TokamakThe heavy excavation works for the future Tokamak Complex were completed in four months. Photo: F4E24 February 2011Next come the ground surveysThe floor of the Seismic Pit is 17 metres below the level of the platform. Ground surveys will provide information about the underlying bedrock in order to verify the assumptions used for the design of the Tokamak Complex. Photo: F4E24 February 2011Milling the surfaceThe Tokamak Excavation area is readied for the pouring of a thin layer of "blinding concrete" that will create the clean and flat work surface upon which to create the 1.5 metre-thick basemat.

Photo: F4E24 February 2011Investigating the rock substrataBy way of radar mapping and the boring of more than 500 holes, geological surveys provided a detailed map of the substratum. Some voids were detected, the largest being a few cubic meters in volume; these small voids, or "karsts" must now be filled with concrete. Photo: F4E24 February 2011The rocky slope ...

Storing the material on site limits the amount of construction traffic on the roads closest to ITER.

In the area of the Tokamak Building, the soil bearing capacity will be at least 100 tonnes per square metre. Photo: F4E07 February 2011Boring and drilling activities continueDrilling is carried out every 4 to 5 metres and up to 5 metres deep in order to explore the rock surface of the Seismic Pit.

Some 360,000 tonnes will rest on the bottom of this Pit, including the foundations, the ITER Tokamak, and Complex edifice.
