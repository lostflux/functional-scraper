This "cineepopea eroica" fusesBeowulfwith Arthurian romance. Magoun (cited by Fry 1299) offers a parodic description and discussion of the Brazilian copy and translation of this work (see Anon 1955 below), without, however, appreciating the original author's combination of wild fantasy with evidence of some learning. To offer just two intriguing examples, the illustrations in Basari's Italian text include readable runes, and the storyteller borrows from the story of Galahad the divinely assisted assumption to Heaven of the hero at his death.

The Legacy of Heorot(New York: Simon and Schuster).
Beowulfretold as science fiction. The "grendels" appear as a natural response to humans disturbing ecological balance on the planet Tau Ceti Four. Fortunately security chief Cadmann Weyland (Beowulf) comes to the rescue. Lots of blood. Niven has a previous hero, Beowulf Shaeffer, first appearing in 1966 and then in the science fiction magazineOmnifor May 1993, and the team has written sequels to their "Beowulf" novel (Beowulf's Children1995, etc.).

*Holt, Tom.
1988.
Who's Afraid of Beowulf?(London: Macmillan). Novel, parodying the mainly comic sagas inSeven Viking Romances, translated by Hermann Pálsson and Paul Edwards (London: Penguin, 1985). Characters from these and other sagas, such as Arvarodd (Arrow-Odd) and Hrolf Kraki, wake up in the modern world. Beowulf appears but is marginal in this very funny book. Republished asExpecting Beowulf, 2002.
†Lehmann, Ruth P. M.
1988.
Beowulf: An Imitative Translation(Austin: University of Texas Press). The cover copy of this translation advertises it misleadingly as "the only one available that preserves both the story line of the poem and the alliterative versification of the Anglo-Saxon original" (back cover). Imitative meter is an important element in Lehmann's presentation and the only aspect of translation she discusses ( pp. 16-18). (Also see Rebsamen, 1991.) Though occasionally obscure or sloppy, often her terse, clear diction works well. The book abounds, however, in misprints and errors of fact surprising from this noted scholar.

†Hudson, Marc.
1990.
Beowulf: A Translation and Commentary(Lewisburg: Bucknell University Press). "Liberal paraphrase might describe the path I took" (p. 17). Hudson's commentary chapter title, "The Syntax of Contemplation," tells us much about the effect he strives for in this fine verse translation, which may appeal more to the sophisticated reader of modern poetry than to the average "Beowulfian." His deeply thoughtful and well-informed commentary on the process of translatingBeowulfmust be read by anyone now writing on the subject.

*†Oliver, Raymond.
1990.
Beowulf: A Likeness, with Randolph Swearer and Marijane Osborn, with an introduction by Fred C. Robinson (New Haven: Yale University Press). "This volume is a rendition of the Old English heroic poemBeowulfwith an accompaniment" (1); the story is told by Oliver as "a re-creation…using modern verse forms" (1). "To convey the plot, setting, characters, and so forth, I have tried to adapt the (realistic) techniques of the historical novel…" (Author's Prologue, 8). Naturally, additional commentary on this (exceptionally beautiful) volume would not be unbiased.
†Oshitari, Kinshiro.
1990.
Beowulf(Tokyo: Kenkyusha). In Japanese.
†Tharaud, Barry.
1990.
Beowulf(Niwot: The University Press of Colorado). Revised 1996. Tharaud's dedication indicates his inspiration and purpose: "For my English 201 students at Gazi University, Ankara, Turkey (1984-86)"; he offers the text in the simplest, most readable English prose compatible with the nature of the poem. "In an attempt to make the poem more accessible and enjoyable to the nonspecialist, nonacademic reader, there are no footnotes, and pertinent historical, literary, or linguistic information is contained in the text or in the brief introduction" (11). I have seen two reviews expressing widely different responses, though the negative one did not seem to take fair account of the translator's purpose. The text is accompanied by the Rockwell Kent lithographs made in 1931.

†Rebsamen, Frederick.
1991.
Beowulf: A Verse Translation(New York: Harper-Collins). "The only translation I am aware of that attempts throughout to imitate the Old English poetic form as closely as is practical in Modern English" (author's introduction, vii). My quick reading finds this alliterative verse translation as good as any other striving for faithfulness.

The Tower of Beowulf(New York: Morrow). Fantasy novel in which Grendel's mother is Loki's ugly daughter by a giantess, whom he turns into a loathly lady-a magical female capable of appearing beautiful. In her lovely aspect she seduces "Shild" and gives birth to his son Grendel. Another grotesque but sensitive monster (like Gardner's Grendel), he comes in later years to prey upon his kinsmen, the Scyldings.

Although the idea bears some relationship to that of Crichton 1976, the execution is quite different. One of the better "Beowulf" novels.

1997.
Be a Wolf (The Adventures of Wishbone #1(Lyrick Studios). Amazon.com's synopsis: This new series of novels is structured like the Wishbone public television episodes, reproducing the major elements and charm of the show while keeping the story focused on Wishbone, the dog. The series is a mixture of novelizations of existing episodes as well as original Wishbone stories. This book is inspired by the classic work, Beowulf.

1999.
