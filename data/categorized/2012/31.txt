ContentsAnnouncementE3 Expo 2011Halo 4was first revealed on Microsoft's homepage hours before the start of their E3 press conference,[12]alongsideHalo: Combat Evolved Anniversarydue to a mistake by the editing department. The game was then officially announced at the end of Microsoft's E3 2011 press conference[13][14]with a short teaser trailer entitled "Awakening."E3 Expo 2012Details onHalo 4were further expanded on in the 2012 E3 Expo, where Microsoft's E3 press conference revealed more aboutHalo 4's game-play. It was here where the new enemies were revealed to bePrometheanAIs, and the return of the former Covenant's member species as foes was officially confirmed. Several minutes of game-play and multiple preview clips of the campaign were shown before the trailer ended with a cryptic message from an "unknown evil."CampaignPlotFour years, seven months, and ten days after the events ofHalo 3, a mysterious energy passes through the aft section ofUNSCForward Unto Dawn. Cortana activates John-117's cryopod as an unknown assailant boards the ship. After progressing through part of the ship the assailant turns out to be theJul 'Mdama's Covenant, to which John-117 expresses concern as he believed that humanity had a cease fire with theSangheili. As John-117 fights his way through the Covenant boarders, it is revealed that it isn't one rogue Covenant ship on a salvage operation, but an entire fleet orbiting a Forerunner world. Cortana notices the nearest cruiser has its shields down and suggests firing a tactical nuke at it. Immediately after the cruiser is destroyed, a passage into the planet opens and activates a gravity well that begins to pull in every ship. The already weakenedForward Unto Dawnstarts to disintegrate as it passes into the planet. While making their way to the escape pods, Cortana starts acting erratically. However, upon reaching the pods, a Covenant cruiser collides with theDawn, tearing through the escape pods. The hull breach blows the Spartan outside just as the wreckage passes through.
John-117 awakens to find himself inside the planet.
Cortanareveals her behavioral problem is due to her going into the first stages ofRampancy. John-117 suggests trying to find a ship back toEarthto see if Dr.
Halsey, Cortana's creator, can fix her condition. Eventually they fight their way through Covenant forces to a localized Cartographer. Cortana says that the only intel she can get is that their location is a shield world calledRequiem. She also receives a signal from an unknown source that is definitely "not Covenant" in origin, and suggests looking for the signal. They find that the mysterious signal is being bounced off of a tower near the planet's core, Cortana opens a portal as close as possible to the core just as a large number of a new type of foe appears.
After being teleported closer to the signal it is revealed the signal is fromUNSCInfinityasking for help. A satellite near the center of the planet is blocking the signal, where two jamming towers are boosting the signal blocking device's power. Cortana suggests taking these jamming towers down to receive the whole signal. After defeating several groups of the unknown enemy, the only intelligence Cortana is able to get on them is the word "Promethean," and that they appear to be more advanced combat AIs than Sentinels. After taking down the first tower it is revealed the Covenant is very interested in finding something inside the core. After the second tower is downed the full signal of theInfinityis received. After discovering the ship is going to enter the planet, Cortana attempts to warn them away but is still unable to get through. Fighting their way to the center of the Satellite the pair discover a giant spherical object - the source of the signal. After attempting to stop the signal the sphere comes close to John's location where part of the sphere comes out of the bottom. A sole figure is seen on a pedestal. The unknown figure reveals himself to beThe Didact, and handily defeats John-117 before declaring that his people, The Forerunners themselves, are returning to the Galaxy after thousands of years, and he remarks on how Humanity must still be weak, as the Covenant do not answer to Humanity and therefore are still unworthy of theMantle.
John manages to escape the Didact and makes his way toInfinity, which had entered the planet. The Didact also heads forInfinity. After fighting off many Prometheans and Covenant, who have joined forces, he finds Commander Thomas Lasky, Spartan Commander Palmer and scattered groups of Marines. Chief clears an LZ for a Pelican to pick them up, and is transported toInfinity, where he fights off waves of Covenant. Then, he is introduced to Captain Andrew Del Rio and Commander Palmer. Palmer, Lasky, and John are sent on a mission to allowInfinityto escape Requiem, and are given aMammoth. After destroying many Covenant vehicles, including aLich, the mission brings John inside what is assumed to be a trap. It turns out not to be when John and Cortana are separately taken by the Librarian, who explains that the Prometheans were once Humans, and how the Didact is looking to escape Requiem and find the Composer, which he plans to turn on humanity. She helps to accelerate Chief's 'evolution' so that he can survive the Composer. Once John and Cortana are reunited, they proceed outside of the Forerunner structures, where they attempt (and fail) to destroy the Didact. They are returned toInfinity, where Del Rio gives the command to leave Requiem; stating that they should return to Earth and inform FLEETCOM about what had occurred. Cortana and John attempt to convince him otherwise, but the Captain orders that Cortana be decommissioned due to rampancy. Upon Chief's refusal to hand her over, he orders both Palmer and Lasky to arrest him, but neither of them move. With Lasky's assistance, John escapesInfinitybefore it leaves and attempts to destroy the Didact once and for all. However, he is unsuccessful, and boards a Lich to follow the Didact into slipspace.
He, along withThe Didactand a Covenant fleet, arrive at HaloInstallation 03, where the Covenant under the Didact's control immediately attack the UNSC science facility orbiting the Halo, that housed the Composer. After fighting his way inside, John argues with some professors there and grabs a HAVOK bomb to attempt to destroy the Composer. Unfortunately, he is too late, and the Composer is fired and kills all on the base aside from him. He takes a Broadsword to follow the Didact to Earth, where he is assisted byInfinity, which is now controlled by Commander Lasky, in getting inside. There, the Didact fires the Composer, and extermination of Humanity begins in New Phoenix. In order to bring down the Didact's shields, Cortana clones her rampant personalities to overload the system. John places her chip in a holo-pedestal, but it is destroyed, and she is brought into the Composer's system. She manages to weakly communicate with John before assisting him in defeating the Didact and destroying the Composer. She uses the last of her energy to form herself into a visible form and touches John for the first and last time. She dies right before the Composer collapses around them. John is found amongst the space debris by a Pelican. Talking with John, Commander Lasky echoes a statement Cortana once made to John regarding the humanity of soldiers. John is seen onInfinity's Spartan deck, having his armor removed.

In the August 22, 2012 Halo Bulletin on Halo Waypoint, it was confirmed that the game would feature about eight campaign missions.
[17]MultiplayerHalo 4's multiplayer capabilities were explored extensively in the gradual buildup to its release on November 6. UnlikeHalo: Reach, multiplayer maps featured in Halo 4 are not based upon campaign levels, but instead were designed from the ground-up, like the other games, with competitive gameplay in mind. Gameplay features a customizable load-out and the return of Armor Abilities[18]To link online competitive multiplayer matchmaking to in-game fiction, it has been coinedWar Gamesby 343 Industries. War Games are held on vast simulated training grounds forSpartan-IVsas part of their preparation forSpartan Opsmissions, which take place 6 months after the conclusion of the campaign.
[18]These simulations are hosted insideUNSCInfinityand allow players to take control of virtualSpartan-IVcharacters and battle in a realistic environment.
Ordnance DropsTo encourage dynamic movement of games and prevent players camping at weapon respawn points,Halo 4features ordnance drops in matches.

[30]A major addition to the customization of characters inHalo 4is the new custom loadouts, allowing players to edit their loadout before games to a much greater degree than that inHalo: Reach. As a player progresses through the ranks, they will unlock additional loadout slots.
Customizable loadout options:Spartan OpsWith the announcement thatFirefightwill not be included inHalo 4's gameplay, 343 Industries announced that they have replaced it with a new episodic co-op series called"Spartan Ops". Spartan Ops features weekly releases of missions on Halo Waypoint that are free to download and will follow the story of Spartan-IVs as they complete vital missions on Requiem six months after the conclusion of the campaign.
[18]Season 1 includes ten episodes with five missions each for a total of fifty missions.
ForgeForge returns inHalo 4with vast improvements to that ofHalo: Reach's Forge mode. These improvements include dynamic lighting (to create more realistic forged environments), more forge items, magnetic linking of objects (to ease attachment), and three Forge-centric maps, each with a different terrain and forge pallets.
[31]A new Forge map was announced at PAX 2013 named "Forge Island" which will have a series of flat spaces.

Forward Unto DawnHalo 4: Forward Unto Dawnis a live-action webseries that debuted on Machinima Prime from October 5, 2012 until the release ofHalo 4onNovember 6th, 2012. Aside from marketingHalo 4, the goal of the webseries is to introduce the franchise to people unfamiliar with the games. 343 Industries franchise business management director, Matt McCloskey, said to Variety: "makeHaloaccessible for people who haven't played the games."ReceptionHalo 4received generally positive reviews upon its release. On aggregate review GameRankings and Metacritic, the game holds scores of 87.42% and 87 out of 100 respectively. Ryan McCaffrey of IGN gave a score of 9.8, callingHalo 4"a bar-raising triumph for the entire first-person shooter genre." The lighting, movements, and animations were well-praised, as well as Neil Davidge's work as the composer forHalo 4, noting it as a "bold shift," but stating that the music is "complementary rather than additive." McCaffrey lauded the campaign for its pacing, as well as "deftly mixing on-foot combat, vehicle sequences, quiet story moments, and key Chief-and-Cortana interactions."Forbeswriter Erik Kain gave high praise to the story, writing thatHalo 4had the "most stunning cutscenes I’ve seen in a video game" contributing to a "beautiful, tragic love story" between Cortana and Master Chief. Mike Mahardy ofGame Informercomplimented the characterization improvements of Chief and Cortana, calling their evolved love story more "focused" and "relatable" to the player, in comparison to the "cloudy and impersonal" stories from the prior games of the franchise. Despite high sales and good reviews Halo 4's multiplayer population has been declining rapidly since its release date all the way through 2013 with daily peaks barely reaching over 30,000.
