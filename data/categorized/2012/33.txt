Threads1 Transcription factor motifsENCODE discovers many new transcription-factor-binding-site motifs and explores their properties2 Chromatin patterns at transcription factor binding sitesBoth chromatin accessibility and histone modifications have different patterns around different transcription factor binding sites3 Characterization of intergenic regions and gene definitionThe prevalence and analysis of ENCODE data are changing the definition and characterization of intergenic and genic regions4 RNA and chromatin modification patterns around promotersPatterns of gene expression can be modelled using histone modifications and transcription factor binding at promoters5 Epigenetic regulation of RNA processingMany novel and previously known non-coding RNA species are characterized in ENCODE6 Non-coding RNA characterizationMany novel and previously known non-coding RNA species are characterized in ENCODE7 DNA methylationENCODE analysis identifies dynamic DNA methylation patterns and relationships to regulatory elements8 Enhancer discovery and characterizationENCODE has developed methods to discover enhancers, and characterized them using comparisons with other data sets and by molecular biology experiments9 Three-dimensional connections across the genomeENCODE mapped long-range looping interactions between functional elements and genes, placing them in a three-dimensional context to reveal their functional relationships10 Characterization of network topologyENCODE data analysis helps to describe the various types of regulatory "wiring" implicit in the genome11 Machine learning approaches to genomicsENCODE has applied machine learning approaches to enable integration and exploration of large and diverse data12 Impact of functional information on understanding variationENCODE provides an initial interpretation of many human variants and plausible leads for the role of many variants identified in genome-wide association studies13 Impact of evolutionary selection on functional regionsThe imprint of evolutionary selection on ENCODE regulatory elements is manifested between species and within human populations.
News and CommentENCODE: The human encyclopaediaFirst they sequenced it. Now they have surveyed its hinterlands. But no one knows how much more information the human genome holds, or when to stop looking for it.
Lessons for big-data projectsTo be successful, consortia need clear management, codes of conduct and participants who are committed to working for the common good, says ENCODE lead analysis coordinator Ewan Birney.
ENCODE explainedThe Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project dishes up a hearty banquet of data that illuminate the roles of the functional elements of the human genome. Here, six scientists describe the project and discuss how the data are influencing research directions across many fields.
See Articlesp.57,p.75,p.83,p.91,p.101&Letterp.109Collaborations: A single cog in a complex machineIf they remain vigilant, early-career researchers can reap benefits from taking part in big international projects.
Research papers in NatureAn integrated encyclopedia of DNA elements in the human genomeThis overview of the ENCODE project outlines the data accumulated so far, revealing that 80% of the human genome now has at least one biochemical function assigned to it; the newly identified functional elements should aid the interpretation of results of genome-wide association studies, as many correspond to sites of association with human disease.
Landscape of transcription in human cellsA description is given of the ENCODE effort to provide a complete catalogue of primary and processed RNAs found either in specific subcellular compartments or throughout the cell, revealing that three-quarters of the human genome can be transcribed, and providing a wealth of information on the range and levels of expression, localization, processing fates and modifications of known and previously unannotated RNAs.
The accessible chromatin landscape of the human genomeAn extensive map of human DNase I hypersensitive sites, markers of regulatory DNA, in 125 diverse cell and tissue types is described; integration of this information with other ENCODE-generated data sets identifies new relationships between chromatin accessibility, transcription, DNA methylation and regulatory factor occupancy patterns.
An expansive human regulatory lexicon encoded in transcription factor footprintsDNase I footprinting in 41 cell and tissue types reveals millions of short sequence elements encoding an expansive repertoire of conserved recognition sequences for DNA-binding proteins.
Architecture of the human regulatory network derived from ENCODE dataA description is given of the ENCODE consortium’s efforts to examine the principles of human transcriptional regulatory networks; the results are integrated with other genomic information to form a hierarchical meta-network where different levels have distinct properties.
The long-range interaction landscape of gene promotersChromosome conformation capture carbon copy (5C) is used to look at the relationships between functional elements and distal target genes in 1% of the human genome in three dimensions; the study describes numerous long-range interactions between promoters and distal sites that include elements resembling enhancers, promoters and CTCF-bound sites, their genomic distribution and complex interactions.
