ScanWatch• Free deliveryFeaturesScanwatch |Clinically ValidatedIt’s time to watch your healthCompatible with iOS and AndroidClinically ValidatedOur most advanced health wearableScanWatch is a hybrid smartwatch designed to monitor health parameters, detect AFib, and help improve overall fitness.
Developed with professionals from world-renowned institutions, ScanWatch boasts clinically validated ECG capabilities, an oximeter for SpO2 measures, and an exceptional battery life of up to 30 days.
The first Withings watch to be FDA-cleared.
ScanWatch is thefirst Withings watch to be FDA-clearedfor its oximetry and ECG features.
Developed with cardiologists and sleep experts, ScanWatch has been validated in two clinical studies for AFib detection. It has already touched countless lives in Europe where it has also been used in German hospitals, as part of a study to monitor patients remotely.
UCSF Hypoxia Research Laboratory, San FranciscoPulse oximetry measurements from ScanWatch have been evaluated and validated, against the gold standard which involved blood oxygen samples analysis.
Hopital Georges Pompidou, AP-HP ParisA study was conducted to validate ScanWatch ECG measurements and AFib detection against the gold standard 12 lead ECG read and interpreted by cardiologists.
Centre Cardiologique du Nord, Paris areaA study was conducted to validate ScanWatch ECG measurements and AFib detection against the gold standard 12 lead ECG read and interpreted by cardiologists.
Ludwig Maximilien University of MunichTo help identify complications, LMU is using ScanWatch in a study consisting of patients who are being remotely monitored from home with measurements of ECG, heart rate, and oxygen saturation.
30 days battery lifeTo help keep an eye on your vital parameters, ScanWatch helps anyone enjoy freedom from the charger as the battery lasts up to 30 days between charges.

ScanwatchNot many true smartwatches or fitness trackers contain quite as many health-monitoring features, from general activity to comprehensive sleep tracking.
ScanwatchWithings has got a lot right with the ScanWatch. It is an attractive hybrid watch that blends traditional aesthetics with some of the smartest technology available on any wearable today (smartwatches included).
ScanWatchMore than ever, we need to take responsibility for our own health and the technology ScanWatch provides allows us to do that.
ScanwatchThe ScanWatch’s traditional clock face hides some of the most advanced tech we’ve seen in a smartwatch yet.
ScanwatchHeart health monitoringProactive heart tracking.
Invaluable peace of mind.
ECGNormalScanWatch automatically records your heart rate, day and night. And at any time, in 30 seconds, an ECG reading is ready whenever you want. A report can be easily shared with a doctor via the Health Mate app.
Proactive heart rhythm monitoringScanWatch tracks heart rate every second during workouts to optimize training, and monitors daily and overnight heart rate to help improve health over time.
On-demand electrocardiogramScanWatch can record a clinically validated electrocardiogram and detect signs of atrial fibrillation—a form of arrhythmia that can be damaging to your health if left undiagnosed. ECG readings can be easily shared with your doctor via the Health Mate app, providing valuable information to help them track your heart health.
Note: ECG must be used under the care of a physician. ECG requires a free in-app activation process. ECG is not intended for use by people under 22 years old. Prescription Use Only.
How to record an ECGTo record an ECG, sit and rest, press the digital crown, scroll in the menu to find the ECG option, press again, then place your fingers on the front electrode for 30 seconds.
Your smartphone can display the live signal during the record, and will keep all measurements to view and share at any time.
How it worksScanWatch is equipped with three electrodes: two are on the back of the case and the other is the metal ring around the watchface.
When you place your finger on the ring, it closes a loop that allows the watch to measure your heart's electrical activity. This method is called a one-lead electrocardiogram.
Why it mattersAn ECG is a way to detect atrial fibrillation (AFib), a prevalent heart arrhythmia. It can be a serious condition that can go undiagnosed because it can show no symptoms and/or not be present during doctor’s visits because the episodes can be intermittent.
Wellness Respiratory monitoringA clinically validated oximeter on your wrist.
ScanWatch uses a clinically validated SpO2 sensor featuring exclusive multi-wavelength technology, so you can record blood oxygen levels from your wrist in only 30 seconds. Also, track breathing disturbances during sleep to monitor sleep quality for overall wellness.
Clinically validated Oxygen Saturation (SPO2)SpO2 provides a measurement of the hemoglobin, red blood cells carrying oxygen, in a person’s blood. Known as blood oxygen saturation, it is used for rapid assessment and monitoring of a person’s respiratory function.
Respiratory Wellness ScanThe Respiratory Wellness Scan feature tracks oxygen saturation, heart rate, breathing frequency and movement all night long.
Our exclusive algorithm, developed with experts, computes the data to track breathing disturbances to manage sleep quality.
How ScanWatch measures SpO2ScanWatch uses a multi-wavelength sensor called PPG (photoplethysmography) sensor that emits and measures red and infrared reflections on the blood vessels in the wrist. An SpO2 value is represented by a percentage. Normal SpO2 values vary between 90 and 100%.
Each SpO2 measurement can easily be found in the Health Mate app and can be shared via the Health Report PDF.
Oxygen saturationNormalBreathing disturbancesLowSleep analysisLie down, breathe, dream.
ScanWatch computes numerous data points to measure Sleep cycles, track breathing disturbances and then calculates your overall Sleep Score—automatically.
Sleep tracking helps you understand your night and make choices that can improve them, such as changing daily activity. Our proprietary AI has been calibrated with a sleep laboratory in Manheim, Germany and with Beclere Hospital in France, using polysomnography, considered to be the gold standard for sleep analysis.
Sleep CyclesScanWatch tracks your sleep cycles (light and deep), duration of sleep, time to be asleep and wake up as well as interruptions, and logs it in the Health Mate app so you can view your trends to help manage your sleep quality.
Healthmate app view11:49PM7:45AM7h54AwakeLightDeepSleep ScoreOur exclusive algorithm automatically scores your night based on sleep cycles, duration, regularity and interruptions.
Healthmate app view75Duration7h54RecoveryGoodInterruptions1 timeRegularityPoorOvernight breathing disturbancesIn addition to analyzing sleep, activating the Respiratory Wellness Scan can track breathing disturbances via the PPG sensor, and the accelerometer based on an analysis of continuous blood oxygen levels (SpO2), heart rate, motion and breathing rate.
Sleep heart ratePeriodic measurements of your heart rate at night will help you understand your Sleep Heart Rate, the average heart rate during sleep. It differs from Resting Heart Rate which is a single measurement, usually taken just after waking up.
Smart Wake-upBecause ScanWatch knows if you are in a light or deep stage, it can choose the best time to wake you up according to your schedule. You simply set a wake-up time in the app, and ScanWatch will wake you with a light vibration.

Workout ModeEasily activate workout mode right on your wrist by choosing from over 30 sports. This shows your workout duration, and logs heart rate and movement continuously.
Fitness levelScanWatch assesses your Fitness Level when you run or walk based on the maximal oxygen consumption (VO2 Max) estimation.
VO2 max is defined as the maximum amount of oxygen an individual consumes over one minute during intense physical effort. The more oxygen consumed, the harder muscles can work, and therefore the higher the VO2 max level.

Robyn FoysterJanuary 23, 2021BITWe’re devilishly impressed. The looks, the functionality, the operation and the battery life are all top-drawer and when you add the price of just $499 RRP ($479 for 38mm version) it makes for astonishing value. Added to the intuitive, mature and well-polished Withings digital health ecosystem, it’s hands down, the best smartwatch on the market.

dcb568October 25, 2020UserVery happy with my ScanWatchPaul WarfieldOctober 23, 2020UserWithings has really hit the target with the ScanWatch. I consider it the best wearable product yet. For me a clear focus on health, quality materials and manufacture, value for money and simplicity in use put it ahead of “do everything” devices. It does everything I want it to do health-wise, and it’s great as a watch too. The optional metal bracelet works really well with it; this and other accessory straps are also well made and way better value than others...

alexOctober 21, 2020UserI upgraded my Steer HR to the ScanWatch because of the additional features. I already loved Health Mate which preferred to the Apple watch and Garmin watch apps. I particularly like the styling of the small model and the crown control is much, much less liable to unwanted selection than a touch screen. Brilliant overall. Previously I have worn a normal watch rather than a smart watch except when I wanted to measure something. The ScanWatch is so good looking and easy to use I haven't worn any of my fancy mechanical watches since I got it!Frank DernieOctober 26, 2020UserExcelent design, and easy of everyday use.
RobertOctober 22, 2020UserAbsolutely fantastic watch. Looks like traditional watch but include inside modern technology. No compromise!

ApostolosOctober 22, 2020UserI have been waiting for the ScanWatch for some time, in particular for the heart monitoring features. I have not been disappointed since receiving mine, I find the features and usage excellent and use it everyday for the full range of functionality that it provides.

The battery life is excellent and so is the accompanying Health Mate app.
Nord-Jan VermeerOctober 25, 2020UserExcellent device hardware-wise, with loads of potential to surpass its competition on the software side as well. The only device worth of consideration for those who do not like fully-fledged smartwatches.
KonstantinosOctober 23, 2020UserThe Withings ScanWatch is definitely a game changer for tracking your overall health. The watch itself houses clinically validated sensors in a beautiful steel case. The battery life is superb and the biggest reason to leave behind the smart watches that dominate our life. Well done, Withings!MikeOctober 22, 2020UserBeautifully crafted hybrid watch.

The only thing Withings can go further is workout tracking. The hardware is there, only the software needs to be polished to fulfill the needs of sporting people.

October 26, 2020UserI like the Scanwatch. The battery life is great. It should have more training features, though.
Staffan SandblomOctober 25, 2020UserI think most smart/sport watches are too ugly and too expensive. Withings is both affordable and classy looking watch with features i can’t find from others.

powmajorOctober 24, 2020UserThe watch looks awesome, like a real classic watch, but it’s smart enough not to need a standard all screen smart watch. It can display most of the info one would need (notifications, quick status info, etc). The rest, is in the app. Battery is awesome - compared with most smart watches out there: couple of weeks vs. couple of days. Built quality is as expected.

Welcome back to the sapphire glass and a nice solid casing lets you know this is a quality watch. All tracking features have been great and with new things being added all the time this is a great all round watch with a class leading battery life.
AbandonedTrolleyFebruary 26, 2021UserWhat I love about this watch is the excellent functionality and range of features whilst looking like a regular, stylish watch. As well as the data readings themselves, the information on how to interpret this data is invaluable, helping to set and reach achievable and realistic targets.
AbbyJanuary 27, 2021UserGreat hybrid watch. Does everything I need and has good battery life. A lot better than the Fitbit Sense I used to own (although step counts and sleep monitoring scores are quite different between the two)!With a wider notification window on the watch and a few tweaks to the software and it would be perfect.
AdamFebruary 20, 2021UserThe watch has a very elegant understated appearance which I like. The quality of the product is also apparent evidenced by the clever one button solid button that allows you to access the functionalities. The watch bristles with features which many users will not need but will find interesting. The battery life does not last the 30 days stated but is still excellent compared to the Garmin watch I had. The watch is super easy and superfast to charge. I get 2 weeks with each charge and would get more but use the GPS 4 times a week for my 20 minute runs. My Garmin forerunner 235 lasted 5 days. The ECG feature is very handy for me as well. The only critiques I have is that the transmission of running info to Strava is not satisfactory at all and the display dial is too small. Overall a classy good looking watch and I am satisfied with the product.
AdamFebruary 6, 2021UserGreat looking time piece, with fantastic technology hidden discreetly.
AdrianMay 17, 2021UserOverall great watch - battery is amazing. Would like the confidence that the measurements are accurateAkMarch 1, 2021UserI'm getting older and my steel armour isn't as solid as before. I bought a ScanWatch to get advanced notice of any irregularity with my body.I love what it tracks and how unintrusive it performs. I only need to charge the watch, with everything activated, once every two weeks. That was a big purchase feature and an absolute most for sleep tracking.It's expensive but it looks great and feels great - I NEVER take it off.

AlybabaJanuary 9, 2021UserOverall a good looking, solid and smart watch. It does what it promises and the phone app is very user friendly just as the watch. Battery life is really impressive. I recommend it to anyone interested in monitoring his her health stats. As a workout watch is inferior to competitors just a little due to lack of GPS integrated and small issues with strava connectivity.

Andrea LeandriMay 22, 2021UserI am really impressed with the ScanWatch. I have been using the Steel HR for many years (pre-Nokia) and been very happy with it. But it felt that it was time for an upgrade. So I went with the ScanWatch. The long battery life is a huge plus for me! I wasn't looking for a watch to interact with my phone - like an Apple Watch. I like the basics of notifications and stuff though. The ECG and oxygen measurements are super easy to use, and the data seem reliable. I prefer the "old school" look of it, and I get compliments for it that both my Steel HR and the new ScanWatch looks like regular watches. I can highly recommend this watch for anyone wanting a hybrid between a smart watch and a "dumb" watch - that helps you keep track of your well being.
Andreas SFebruary 16, 2021UserNotwithstanding the features of the ScanWatch I’m impressed with the look of the watch. I don’t want to look like an athlete. It looks good.
Andrew grovesNovember 5, 2020UserThe watch and app are excellent. Delivery times are longAndy JenNovember 22, 2020UserScanWatch is one the watches in the Smartwatch sector.

I can only recommend it!AngelaJanuary 11, 2021UserLove everything about my Withings but it would be great if it was easier to scroll through the menu while wearing the watch. Button on the side is a fit fiddly to access and turn and it would be great if this could be improved.
AnnMay 13, 2021UserThe ScanWatch is my second Withings watch, I fell in love with the brand after the first one and now again. The look is so elegant, I can really wear it every day. Having a Withings watch has really motivated me to excercise more, walk more and overall live healthier. It has helped me regulate my sleep schedules better and even realize when my heart rate is out of place when I’m stressed and helps me calm down.
AnnaApril 20, 2021UserVery good looking watch with excellent functionalities, helps me significantly to monitor my healthAriTFebruary 22, 2021UserTop Marks for Scanwatch.
ArriMarch 20, 2021UserScanwatch doing that job what was advertised. I am satisfied with it.
AttilaNovember 25, 2020UserThis is a very nice watch, looks formal but gets all the smartwatch features. could use a little luminescence on the hands, and a thermometer feature would be neat, and a second hand, but otherwise for a smartwatch, I highly recommend it if you like to have regular looking watches that are formal looking with good featuresaverage guyNovember 17, 2020UserGreat intuitive and informative. Glad I waited until now to get a smart watch !BeanyBearNovember 3, 2020UserThe ScanWatch is a beautiful piece with fantastic features. I went from being an Apple Watch fan for many years and have never looked back.

BobMay 1, 2021UserHaving tried four health watches, I am delighted with my ScanWatch because it does give me confidence as to accuracy of readings plus the terrific battery life between charges. Happily recommend this watch to anyone concerned with their heart.

Bob WicksMay 18, 2021UserThe ScanWatch is as easy to use as all the other Withings products. No overengineering, no complexities, a product for normal human being with a lot of useful functionalities. I'm using the BPM Core for blood pressure measurement since it came on the market and I'm promoting to cardiologists as well because it is easy to use and no-nonsense. The same applies to the smart scale, to the smart thermometer, ...
BobFJanuary 8, 2021UserThe ScanWatch is an excellent smart watch for tracking normal health data. I have not bought it to track my exercise so I haven't even bothered looking at how well it does this, but for everything else it does well with one exception. Sleep tracking is not very accurate. It seems to think that when I'm in bed reading that I'm also which completely ruins sleep scores and sleep tracking. It also does not pick up when I'm reading on my phone even when in using the connected Healthmate app! This is just daft and should be fixed. Otherwise I really enjoy this watch. It is comfortable though quite heavy, easily readable, unobtrusive, useful, beautifully simple to use. It's just s shame about the sleep tracking. Unfortunately the Healthmate app the watch connects to really needs a lot more work. It gathers data quite well (though that inability to work out in not sleeping when using the phone it's loaded on is pretty dumb) but data display choices are poor, data analysis is limited, user interface is poor, sometimes counter intuitive and therefore frustrating.
BrantaFebruary 13, 2021UserGreat watch to monitor and help improve your healthBrendanApril 4, 2021UserScanwatch is my best purchase in some time. i provides all the information i require while not being large or cumbersome.
Brendan JRMarch 8, 2021UserExcellent ECG smart watch with great battery life and the time display is easily readable 24 hours a day without having to press a button or flick the wrist.
Captain KayosMay 2, 2021UserAn awesome watch which is looking awesome beside health monitoring you need.
CarstenJanuary 6, 2021UserSuper watch love itCbohynJanuary 8, 2021UserFantastic watch great features and useful to have all health data in one place. Intuitive to use and great that it links to other apps such as Strava.
cebeeJanuary 28, 2021UserThe ScanWatch further improves on the health side, will remaining a classic watch in look. The battery life of a good month is more than adequate and charging is easy. That's the most important for me.The small display showing all sorts of notifications, also during workouts or walks, is well thought out and a great addition compared to my previous Withing watch.I must admit I love buying wristbands: I've now more than 10 of them and like to change from bright yellow to classy black leather when I fancy it. It make me wear another watch every few days.
CeSingeDecember 2, 2020UserLove it! Awesome quality and useful for monitoring heart. Looks distinctive but understated.
ChrisNovember 1, 2020UserAn excellent watch. YOu will not be disappointedChrisApril 26, 2021UserExcellent smart watch - can't recommend enough.
ChrisApril 25, 2021UserBeautiful hardware, comfortable, light, simple, discreet. Great activity tracking and ECG/SPO2 on demand monitoring. Sleep tracking is awful, struggles to determine if/when you are awake and out of bed despite having and utilising an alarm on the watch itself. Worse than Microsoft Band 1/2, Fitbit Ionic and Sleepon Go2sleep. Connected GPS works fine, shame it is not included but understandable with other sensors etc. App is not polished or professional enough, it's clunky and not slick. I do really like the ScanWatch and it's so close to being amazing; if they can fix sleep tracking it will be very, very good.
Chris TyasJanuary 7, 2021UserI have had this watch for a few weeks now and love it. It does everything I need, is easy to set up and understand and looks beautiful. You can change the straps to change the look and as yet I am very impressed with it.

DaltonJanuary 28, 2021UserI was looking for a smartwatch with classic styling but without sacrificing features. ScanWatch has everything and more. It fits with all looks while bringing fitness tracking and notifications easily into view. And the addition of being able to change straps so easily makes it the perfect smartwatch purchase.
DanFebruary 1, 2021UserA good-looking smartwatch for all-round health monitoring, with a great battery lifeDanielJanuary 1, 2021UserI moved to the ScanWatch from the Steel HR, the ScanWatch feels like a much more polished product, though functionally it shares many features. When you activate the display, the hands move so as not to obstruct you view. The display is bright and slightly larger than my previous watch. The watch measures all the usual stats Steps/pace/calories used/distance travelled/Heart Rate etc.. but now adds detection of Atrial Fibrillation, SPO2 and sleep apnoea. For all of this, one of the best features is something mundane, the battery life, I find it can last 3-4 weeks between charges, which is awesome when compared to other brands. It may not have the big colour screens of some of it's competitors, but it's functionality, battery life and day to day usability make this an obvious choice for me.
DarylApril 12, 2021UserQuality product that does what it says . Reliable functions and links in great with the partner apps I use. Riding 5 days a week MTB off road it stands up to the job and thus far never let me down. It connects well with my Apple se phone for gps tracking and shares data reliably with my strava app. The medical functions are brilliant and as a 65 yr old make for interesting reading. Can’t recommend this product highly enoughDaveApril 28, 2021UserIt’s an easy watch to use, looks nice and the battery lasts for ages. It’s a good upgrade from the Steel HR. I just wish the Bluetooth connection to IOS was more stable.
DaveApril 19, 2021UserAn exceptional means of enabling me to live healthilyDave from CanberraMay 21, 2021UserThe scan-watch has surpassed my expectations, extremely well made and robust with its toughened glassDavidNovember 22, 2020UserThe ScanWatch is an attractive smart watch that focuses on health and sleep tracking with amazing battery life. The first thing I do every morning is check the sleep stats to see what portion of my sleep was deep and how my blood oxygen levels were during the night. Sleep interruptions are tracked and always accurately displayed. The rare times when I have to take the watch off to charge it I feel anxious that I'm missing notifications and steps are not being counted! All in all it's a great bit of tech.
DavidJanuary 31, 2021UserThe most satisfying product purchase I have ever made. Quality construction, beautiful design, attention to detail and does what it claims, unlike many other products of its ilk.

I am wearing them all day and night which gives me great insights into my health and routine and I absolutely love ~20 days of battery life. With the phone notifications and vibrations, I don't even remember when was the last time I turned on ringing on my smartphone :) The same for the smart unobtrusive alarm which won't wake up my family.

Long battery life makes it easy maintenance. Simple to use, classic and understated design. Highly recommended!DianaApril 27, 2021UserI bought this watch over others because it looks better. I hate watches for fashion purposes and because I have really small wrists. The watch face is still a bit too big for me. The exercise but is the most disappointing aspect. It’s sub par at best with uploading, tracking , and recognising.
DianaJanuary 14, 2021UserExcellent watch, probably the best device Withings made.
DmitriApril 21, 2021UserThe ScanWatch in combination with the HealthMate app is the best wearable I know.Its classic and timeless design combines beautifully with the modern functionality expected from a smartwatch to give a seamless experience day and night. The screen is way less noticeable than the product pictures suggest - With the black dial it is near invisible. Using all features regularly, I still get more than two weeks of battery life and then only need to charge it for a few hours while I’m on the computer, missing neither sleep nor exercise data.The recordings are displayed in a compact, modern, and easy to access fashion in the HealthMate app, which also allows tweaking of most watch settings and menus. The ease of use and elegance of the App was a major factor for my purchase decision, having owned another Withings watch before.While there are still some minor problems within the app, Withings are (and have always been) quick to respond to any questions and issues and are constantly working on improving their products further - Not just their future products, but their current ones at least just as much!Dominik UherJanuary 9, 2021UserExcellent watch and app. Use it all the time.

Evan M. HartJanuary 3, 2021UserMy ScanWatch has made me more aware of my health and what I can do to improve it. It's continual feedback works like 'bio feedback' and is really helpful in keeping up motivation.
Evelyn DalianApril 15, 2021UserThis is my 3rd watch from Withings, and I am absolutely in love with ScanWatch, as it brings the latest features and tech to my wrist with a classic look and feels. The best smartwatch which you can find on the market right now.

Florin LasloMay 16, 2021UserWatch is great, just be aware that some features may not be available where you live. Like the ECG feature in Canada.
Foxeh_BlueDecember 10, 2020UserI really like the ScanWatch watch, it’s elegant and beautifulFrancasMarch 31, 2021UserGreat product giving me a lot of insight with a minimalist style of a classic watch! Love it!FredJanuary 27, 2021UserGood and useful product! Must be updated batteryGAMarch 2, 2021UserFirstly I have atrial fibrillation which is a common condition and is well controlled by talking a daily beta blocker. When I heard that this watch was being released and was medically certified I had to have one as it would and it has monitored my AF. The watch itself looks so classic and the features built in although many and really good at what they do are hidden in the background and activated via the crown which is very responsive and gives you access to a range of metrics and monitors in a very subtle way that is just the right amount of information that anyone would require. Of course if you want to deep dive into stats the app expands massively and is as good as any other I’ve used and I have tried them all. I have found the monitors and the stats to be very accurate and the battery is a refreshing change not having to charge it often. I reckon I’m getting about 20 days easily and could probably get the stated 28 days if I tweaked the settings. My research before buying has payed off. I usually change my tech on a whim and always seem to have the latest. Well I will definitely be keeping this for a long time... love everything about it especially the look.
GavJanuary 27, 2021UserSimple, elegant, practical.
GeoffJanuary 8, 2021UserQuality watch which looks and feels good to wear. Health and activity monitoring works well and is quite motivational as it gives reasonable assessments and goals that are realistic.

GeorgeRDecember 26, 2020UserI like this watch because it measures importent things about my health. Together with other products from Withings and the app it has become my favourite smartwatch.
GolfbossJanuary 9, 2021UserExcellent watch. Love the classy looks that disguise excellent health tracking features. The standout feature is the battery life - no more daily ( or even weekly) charging!GraemeApril 27, 2021UserIdeal for AF surveillance.My AF comes and goes, some days my heartbeat is normal - other days it goes irregular. This watch is perfect to alert you when this occurs. Well worth the money 👍GrahamNovember 6, 2020UserFantastic watch does what it is meant to do and elegant looking and great value for moneyGraham. CJanuary 19, 2021UserI’ve owned Withings watches pretty much since they first came out. They’ve always been great but in it’s latest generation - the ScanWatch - Withing’s has produced a product that has no equal in the marketplace. I’ve always thought the Apple watch to be absurd - a watch that runs out of battery power in less than a day. The ScanWatch always lasts at least a month between charges, it’s highly competent, classy, well made and inexpensive. You simply can’t go wrong owning one.
GrahamCNovember 24, 2020UserA fantastic watch that has all the features I need for heart health and exercise, and the battery life is good. It looks great as well! I am only a little concerned about the durability of the proprietary charger.
GrazFebruary 25, 2021UserReally lovely watch: it’s an elegant traditional watch with a cleverly thought out digital aspect that is superb.Extensive battery life makes it far more practical than an Apple Watch. Any of the features the Apple Watch has the Withings watch does not are better on a phone and as you need a phone anyway to get the best out of an Apple Watch, why bother?FitBit is, by comparison, hideous and less battery life too.Delighted to have found out about Withings, will be buying for family members and advocating widely.
GregMay 3, 2021UserVery happy with my ScanWatch purchase, my experience is spot on with my research and my needs.

It is visually a beautiful watch design, with classic looks with the smarts to monitor your heath. Having heart related issues, it assists with providing both me and my doctors with the heath data collected with no additional ongoing costs. The Health mate app is well designed and very user friendly. I would easily recommend Withings to others seeking a smart / heath watch.

John ByrneApril 14, 2021UserI have been using Samsung Galaxy watches and I was pondering a change and then I saw a review that stated this person was a lot happier with his classic scan now watch and I was very intrigued. I loved it straight away, the family has a history of heart disease and I have been having a few heart flutters and I thought this could be my new watch and I purchased it as soon got paid. I have worn it constantly for 3 months now and have only charged it "twice" I was blown away with the battery life and that great daily report which I have shown a medical professional in a consultation.

I got COVID-19 in mid March 2020, and got all kind of symptoms. Most of the year I was on sick leave part time, and I felt like if I would never get well again. Thank's to ScanWatch I could actually measure that my long term physical data improved slowly, even though I could not feel it yet. This was really encouraging! Thank you Withings!Jonas MNFebruary 3, 2021UserThe ScanWatch does everything I need it to and looks good while doing it! I love the professional look and feel of the watch.

The ECG works well but I would like to check it for accuracy which is impossible without a visit to the doctors. It is expensive and should include a premium band. One real plus is the battery life which on the 1st charge lasted 26 days.
KBABBDecember 4, 2020UserI've been really impressed with the ScanWatch in both its appearance and functionality and with the Health Mate app provides so much current health and fitness information and it's presented really clearly and concisely.
Keith CastleFebruary 22, 2021UserThis is a watch that gives the competition a run for their money. All manner of body monitoring including heart, ECG, AFib, SP02, sleep and so much more. To add to this the battery life is fantastic, I exercise and cycle several times a week and the battery is now in its third week without charging, very impressive. Last but not least the watch is light and very stylish. An unobtrusive device that hides a lot of health capabilities beneath its veneer. The Withings ScanWatch is definitely to be considered as your healthy companion.

MaciejApril 6, 2021UserLove my ScanWatch I feel I have peace of mind with my health now.
MaddyMay 4, 2021UserI am using ScanWatch the last month after passing from many other Brands and smartwatches such as Samsung, Huawei, fitbit, etc. All of them had their pros and cons but the ScanWatch is covering 90% of my needs as a normal user who exercises regularly (walking, Pilates...) and wants to have an idea of his health picture. Battery last for around 20 days, the notification part is very good. What ti would like to see in the future in order to co er also the rest 10% is a bigger version of the watch (46cm) a better split of deep sleep at the app and also some addition features such as blood pressure and Body temperature.
ManoloApril 12, 2021UserI love my watch. I love how it doesn’t look like a smart watch. It gives me all the information I need without being complicated or too much.
ManuelaFebruary 14, 2021UserLove my watch, really impressed with app. One happy customer 😀MariaMarch 9, 2021UserLove my watch, really impressed with app. One happy customer 😀MariaMarch 9, 2021UserThe perfect elegant watch with all the smart features you need. But nothing else. Add a nice band and it will look like any nice traditional watch. Tracking your heart and counting your steps without anyone knowing.
MariusJanuary 15, 2021UserI am finding my ScanWatch with black face a great blend of style and functionality. Battery life is so much better than many smart watches too. Functions are easy to set up and use with the app and the summary reviews give good data to monitor progress, sleep patterns etc. Would definitely recommend for anyone that need more data for their heart, oxygen saturation, sleep levels etc. Keeps perfect time synchronised to the phone, loved that I didn’t need to faff about when BST started, the watch did it itself.
MarkApril 22, 2021UserExcellent watch, the app needs updatingMarkApril 25, 2021UserI’m very happy with my new Scanwatch. I bought the 42mm black version, which has a solid, well built and weighty feel to it, as well as looking good.Setup is super easy and finding how to use all the functions is very intuitive.I took some months to decide to purchase the ScanWatch but the quality and ease of use have surpassed my expectations.I would definitely buy another one as a gift for someone!MarkMay 15, 2021UserAll good, love this deviceMark HJanuary 3, 2021UserExcellent, but could use some small imporvementsMark3796December 25, 2020UserGood productsMartinDecember 14, 2020UserMuch better than an apple watch for health tracking would highly recommend the withingsMartin UrquhartApril 23, 2021UserLike the watch and cardiac related features however workings really need to work on customer serviceMartyFebruary 28, 2021UserGreat product! But hard core runner will probably choose other…MatsMay 1, 2021UserFirst found Withings for the Steel HR but after looking in store didn't like the size/shape of the watch. When I heard the ScanWatch was being released in January I continually checked for updates on the release and purchased it immediately. Incredibly happy with the ScanWatch and the way it looks, I have received multiple compliments and friends have since purchased it. Exactly what I was after, a smart looking, smart watch for general day to day use. I have since purchased one for my girlfriend as a Christmas present.
MattNovember 17, 2020UserGreat build quality and easy to set up and navigate. Looks like a classic watch but with a test.
Matt BowmanJanuary 27, 2021UserI try few tracking devices, ScanWatch is the best. I like battery life and easy setup with iPhone! My recommendation!MaxxyMay 2, 2021UserA quality, beautiful hybrid smartwatch. Great tracker backed up by the best fitness app by far,worth every pennyMichael ballFebruary 14, 2021UserGreat product that provides an insight into how your body is doing at any given moment. Ability to share data with health care professionals is invaluable. Battery life very good.
Michael MApril 16, 2021UserAbsolutely the best smart watch on the market for features and design and certainly the price, withings has created a great product that fits everything I need to look after my health and with accuracy. I have now retired my Apple Watch 😊Michael VGFebruary 17, 2021UserGood product. Perfect appMicheleApril 22, 2021UserExtremely happy with my Scanwatch. Does everything I need in watch with health supportMick SlaterApril 5, 2021UserIt's a nice looking watch with a lot of features. Deciding factor for me was that is one of the rare watches that recognise cycling automatically.
MihaelNovember 29, 2020UserLoving the design and the functionality of the watch - a smart watch that really does look good and on which I can change the strap for particular looks or occasions. The watch is really helping me in two areas of interest - monitoring my activity level and monitoring my sleep cycles. All in all, I am very happy with the purchase.
MikeJanuary 10, 2021UserThe ScanWatch looks and feels beautiful. The measurements suit my needs, the app is very easy to use, and the battery life is good (though 30 days is optimistic. Working out five times a week and taking an ecg every other day means I'm lucky to get 18 days out of it, and that's with Quicklook off). I wish the health reports the app generates were more varied. Regardless of the specialist you wish to send it to, they're all identical. I'd like to see more heart rate data for the cardiologist, for example. Apart from that, I love the watch.
MikeMarch 21, 2021UserA good alternative to Apple. Looks like an attractive watch and some nice additions straps are availableMike ENovember 17, 2020UserAbsolute the favorite!MogensMay 22, 2021UserA near perfect hybrid watch. I love to be able to see notifications and decide not to pick up my phone all the time, track exercise and track my sleep. What I don't want is a small phone on my wrist that need constant charging, is bulky and need to be angled a certain way to see what time it is. ScanWatch is a great looking watch and with the sapphire glass and a leather strap I can see myself using it all day for many years to come.
Mr. UtterApril 11, 2021UserMy ScanWatch was a gift given as a way to monitor some questionable health concerns. It has proven itself to be accurate and true where having an immediate testing tool has given me peace of mind. The app then provides more health information and motivation to help you improve your lifestyle. And the watch looks great!Ms AnserApril 20, 2021UserThis watch doesn't look like a weirdo watch. It does what I need: notifications, sport tracking, heart rate, steps count.

The Withings ScanWatch is definitely a step up in terms of look and functionality. I like the fact that it's not trying to be a computer on your wrist. I want, and have, with the Withing ScanWatch) something that accurately tells the time, records activity, monitors key health indicators and is stylish and rugged. 100% solid device - great work and recommended :)OggyApril 29, 2021UserCould be the perfect watch, needs to be more accurate with the sleep app and workouts.

PawelNovember 3, 2020UserI have had my ScanWatch for a couple of months now and I have to say I'm really enjoying it. It is a little bulkier than my previous steel hr which I love and the features work great. It looks like a great timepiece while allowing you to keep an eye on your sleep, cardiovascular health and fitness. The bezel works great, I find I have to turn the watch towards me on my wrist on certain workouts because I keep accidentally pausing it, it still tracks my heart rate without issue. Great watch.
PeterDecember 13, 2020UserLove the watchPeterApril 19, 2021UserWith the additional new features (SPO2 level, ECG, breathing disturbances measurements, etc), the Withings ScanWatch is the best health monitor and smart watch out there with a month of battery power, hands down. The long lasting battery alone makes this device unique and outstanding on the wearables market. I love the perfect blend of a classic watch face and smart watch functions.
Peter CsorbaApril 9, 2021UserGreat value for money.Looks like an expensive watch.Great to have the data it measures at your fingertips.Motivates you to make improvements and measure the changes.Glad I bought one :-)Peter FrankishApril 6, 2021UserI am very pleased with the ScanWatch, both its smart analog/digital face and its technical features.

RAYMONGFebruary 22, 2021UserThe ScanWatch is my first smart-watch. I didn't buy one before that as I felt they were too gimicky. However, Youtube reviews presuaded me that I should try the Withings Scanwatch. I like the data that I get on my activity levels, heart rates and health.
RehmanDecember 22, 2020UserFantastic watch, I absolutely love it. Excellent quality at a really good price.
Richard MMay 29, 2021Userthe Withings ScanWatch is made for go, not for show. Nonetheless, it's a subtle but stylish addition to any wrist and an essential addition to anyone interested in their health, day and night. Activity monitoring is scarily accurate and connective convenience is part of the appeal - it'll let you know what your phone is doing if you like - but the main aim of this dark little genius is to keep an eye on your health in as many ways as legally possible in Australia. In short, no other smartwatch can match its health-related features or scientific/medical accreditation. I'll be watching as this classy entry into the overcrowded and hyper-coloured smartwatch market continues to evolve.
RobFebruary 9, 2021UserFantastic build quality. Battery life is exceptional, even with daily exercise tracking. Very well thought out digital display with intuitive interaction using the crown. Can't fault this at allRob CatchMay 16, 2021UserScanWatch is the ultimate smart watch and health monitor with a battery and clinical grade health monitoring that leaves the others behind.

Can't wait to go surfing with it!RomainJanuary 27, 2021UserThe Withings ScanWatch has potential to be excellent, once the issues with sleep tracking accuracy have been resolved. Optional heart rate monitoring would allow me to dump my Fitbit. It’s annoying having to wear two watches...
RoseJanuary 4, 2021UserThe ScanWatch does everything it says it does the downside is the wristband provided which is uncomfortable and unsightly. The watch should be supplied with a choice of wristbabdsRoy KeasleyMarch 12, 2021UserAn excellent all-round watch with excellent battery life.
RTJNovember 3, 2020UserUnlike a lot of other health watches out there, this watch is definitely a class act. From the stainless steel case to the sapphire dome, the build quality is superb. The battery life is excellent, I get around two weeks of use out of it even when tracking at least one exercise session a day. This is understated device that still collects a ton of useful data.
RvanS80March 22, 2021UserWanted a smart watch with a traditional feeling. Found this make and researched everything about it. All sounded perfect and so purchased this for a big birthday present for myself. Works every time. Battery life amazing. And looks as smart as any traditional watch does. Love it.
Ryan MFebruary 16, 2021UserI have the black dial, 40mm watch. It is very comfortable to wear with the black rubber strap. It is a very classical looking watch with a nice sapphire crystal and simple hour & minute dial markings, not lumed. Some very weak lume applied on the minute & hour hands. The watch has a nice feature that when you bring your wrist up to look at the time, the watch will display the time & date on the dial face. Battery life is excellent; very easy to recharge.

The features are great and comprehensive, and the battery life is phenomenal! The watch provides all the information I needed for monitoring my daily health and it looks great too! The one drawback (and this is a big one for me) is the very weak notification vibration! There should be the ability to control both the strength and the length of the vibrations through the app. They are often missed because they are so weak! If the ScanWatch solved that, and I believe it could with a firmware update, it would be the perfect device for me!ScottMarch 1, 2021UserGreat product for AFib monitoring ... great to have dependable reassuranceScotty TFebruary 5, 2021UserJust add the clinically-validated blood pressure monitor feature.
Shailen PothenMarch 26, 2021UserA wonderful smartwatch, better than Fitbit. Good battery life and full of useful features. Recommend it!Silviu BerbinschiFebruary 6, 2021UserA reliable watch that does all the things you need to monitor your health, and is properly certified. For a long time Withings ScanWatch has been the only watch with a certified ECG feature in Australia. Now the Apple Watch is there too, but you should still buy a Scanwatch. Why? There’s no point having a device that’s not on your wrist to take an ECG. The great thing about the ScanWatch is the time between charges is measured in weeks not days or hours, so you can almost always have it on your wrist. Having it on at night also means you can take advantage of the advanced oxygen saturation measurements that it also takes overnight. A great thing if your on the border of sleep apnea. There’s also one more thing that as someone a bit older you might appreciate an actual watch face that you can just glance at and read. Only criticism would be that the glow in dark hands on mine should probably be matched by a glow in the dark mark at 12 too.
SimonMay 8, 2021UserAn excellent watch that monitors my heart beats, but also sleeping and breathing patterns. Would highly recommend for anyone who is on the lookout for a decent heart rate monitor, that has an incredible battery life!SimonMay 7, 2021UserAn excellent product which is easy to use and the information is clear and accurate.

The ability to measure ECG and SPO2 and the ability to give you an overall fitness level coupled with the ability to last nearly 30 days on a single charge is probably unique in the market.

Simplicity with technology, very well combined. Look forward to withings next project. Can you better the Scanwatch? Who Knows!Stephen BennettDecember 28, 2020UserThe new ScanWatch is pretty much everything I had hoped it would be. It looks extremely classy. It shows enough information on the inbuilt screen, with any more detailed information at hand on the health mate app, which I have already been using for some time, along with some other withings products. Overall very happy with this watch, and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to my friends.
Stephen DMarch 2, 2021UserThere are so many things to love about the ScanWatch! The build quality is amazing, it looks beautiful, the interface is super simple, the notifications are subtle, the battery life is impressive, and so much more. But if I had to pick one, it's that it just gets out of the way and lets you get on with life. It's a watch, not a distraction, always there to tell you the time, but ready to do so much more when you're ready. I don't have to worry about charging it or damaging the touchscreen, it just lives on my wrist.
Stephen Rees-CarterFebruary 5, 2021UserPrimarily a sensible watch with health tracker functions. More comfortable to wear (less sweaty) than the silicone band versions.
Steve AshtonApril 25, 2021UserLove the look of the watch, love the battery life, so easy to operate beats tapping on the watch. ECG brilliant. Bought another one for my wife.
Steve LintonNovember 7, 2020UserLove the look of the watch, classy, with underlying intelligence. The controls are easy to use and the screen is clear and responsive. Battery life is excellent. I would like to see REM sleep detected and recorded.
Steve MJanuary 11, 2021UserHonestly couldn't promote this watch enough. The Withings ScanWatch is amazing. It covers all the essential health requirements and more! The fitness tracking is extensive and accurate and the sleep tracking gives more than enough information. The fact you can also programme in weight tracking and connect with third party apps like Google Fit is also a win. Have recommended this watch to others and will definitely be sticking with Withings as a brand.
StevenMarch 27, 2021UserI have been using the ScanWatch for a couple of months now and I'm really happy with it so far.All the features work well. The watch is comfortable and I've only taken it off twice to charge it. The only glitch I've had is some cutting of music when listening to music through a Bluetooth speaker. The ECG works well but does not read heart beats much faster than about 130 bpm. The workout mode has been spot on every time and again the watch is comfortable to wear. All in all a nice looking watch with all the usual features and soon to come more I hear.
StulliFebruary 23, 2021UserAll in all a great productStureGJanuary 12, 2021UserIf you want a very smart elegant looking watch, without all the features that probably never get used on any chunky Smartwatch, but gives you the most important health information and extremely useful health app you will find, then ScanWatch is what you should be looking at. It is the smartest smartwatch you will find.

TFALMarch 9, 2021UserThe ScanWatch is a great piece of hardware. There is still some glitches to be fixed on the firmware regarding automatic exercise detection but I am certain that the Withings team is working on it!ThiagoFebruary 27, 2021UserFantastic, fully featured smart watch with a classic look.
ThomasFebruary 26, 2021UserThe ScanWatch hardware is simply the best in any health/fitness tracker available to date. It looks super premium and feels great on the wrist. Battery life is simply outstanding. I do not reach the claimed 21 days battery life, but I easily get 14 days out of a single charge including daily 1 hour workout. Unfortunately, it is let down by a few key features that it is lacking in the software department, especially for athletes. There is no ability to use an external chest strap for more accurate heart rate during workouts. Moreover, calories burned do not take heart rate data into account, making the “burned calories”virtually useless. Lastly, I wish we could use any metric to be displayed on the little second hand on the watch, not only steps (for instance intensity minutes). But all in all it is a great looking watch that is both fitting for a gala dinner and on the running track.
ThomasMarch 18, 2021UserAn excellent watchThomas welshNovember 30, 2020UserA great looking, fully functional sports watch providing all the information required to get to your personal health goals. Its viewable dynamically on-screen and via a full featured app. This also integrates fantastically with MyFitnesspal app too.
TimMarch 8, 2021UserFantastic product. I was blown away by the features packed into this watch. Wearing it everyday with the features activated to their highest amounts still nets me a battery of almost 2 weeks! The easy to use magnetic fast charging (mine charges in about 30 minutes from 25% to full) no batteries to change or cables to plug in or places for debris/water to damage, I really couldn't be happier.Sleep tracking, cardio tracking, and activity tracking seems very close, if not completely accurate. The SPO2 and Heart Rate features match the finger meter I have every time I have checked.If you're not wanting the trouble of the short battery bulky "screen watches" this is a watch you will really love. Analog display that auto syncs your time (if you travel and change localities, your watch will adjust with you) it provides a quick easy to read digital display that shows the time brightly if the room is too dark to read the hands.
Timothy RoxxFebruary 11, 2021UserGreat watch it does what it says on the tinTiziMay 29, 2021UserFabulous watch, a step up again from the Steel HR. The app is really well organised and easy to use too.

Helps me monitor my heart condition I have recently been diagnosed with, and since purchased my ScanWatch has detected 2 episodes of my condition, so I have been able to deal with them accordingly..Recommend to anyone...
TomoApril 18, 2021UserI found the Withings ScanWatch to be comfortable, easy to use, aesthetically pleasing to look at and functional. My main reason for going with the Withings watch is for health functionality as opposed to social or business reasons.The notifications works well enough for what I need, although the round screen cold be better if the made it a rectangular shape to get more of a message in, but this is not a major thing for me.The health aspect is better than what I have used before but the SPO2 function seems to report slightly higher in oxygen saturation when compared to my Pulse Oximeter.The breathing disturbances data seems to have locked out when I activated the sleep oxygen saturation function, but this could be me not understanding enough whether these two functions can work in parallel or only one at a time.If they add a blood pressure function and maybe make the notifications screen slightly bigger (I could handle a slightly larger watch face to do this), then I think the Withings Watch is a real winnerTony FMay 29, 2021UserThe watch overall is a vast improvement on previous models. The menu system is more intuitive and gets a little getting used too. The features match those of another famous brand and in my opinion are better, especially the battery life. They auto recognition that you are doing an activity is great and very useful if one forgets to start an exercise.
TonyGraysonNovember 3, 2020UserGreat watch, very positive upgrade from HR Sport watch. The rotating crown and improved screen, notifications and health capabilities make this s fabulous watch, and the hands glow at last!TorApril 26, 2021UserOverall an excellent smartwatch that provides me with unbeatable health tracking, superb battery life and looks great with formal/office wear. Highly recommended.
TreamerApril 29, 2021UserA great smart watch for anyone that wants to monitor vital signs for heart disturbances, sleep disturbances, health levels e.t.c. Very stylish as well, keeping the look very traditional which I really like. Great value for the price.
Troy JennerJanuary 3, 2021UserI am well pleased with my purchase, it is easy to set up and navigate the workings both of the watch and the app, and it gives me all the information i require to improve my health and fitness, the only negatives i found were the instructions to reset the watch if required need to be improved and the watch does not scan my sleep every night which is disappointing.
TwMarch 16, 2021UserThis is a stylish and functional watch. It looks innocent on the surface but hides a wild beauty underneath. Like a girl you can take to meet the parents who is a secret party animalUrnowsmokingJanuary 8, 2021UserFully integrated end to end health tracking system that delivers only the critical details. All of the products work well together, including long battery life, and minimal fuss. Great looking, classy, not geeky.
Anonymized userNovember 18, 2020UserThis is the third Withings watch I have purchased. I continue to come back for the quality, style and look of the watch, combined with all the health tracking capabilities that one could need.
Anonymized userApril 25, 2021UserScanwatch + Healthmate are very user-friendly and reliable. Especially bluetooth interface seems to have improved. Signal ECG-measurement too weak and too noisy.
Anonymized userApril 27, 2021UserScanWatch offers the best balance of features, appearance, and battery life. It tracks my activity, displays time, and pulls notifications from my phone (those that I want to see!). All that without the need to charge the watch every night. Wonderful!VictorMay 5, 2021UserI love this watch. It has really helped me to take some control over my sleep and is very helpful to see exactly how much walking I do during the day. It is an amazing product and I am delighted with it.
VirginiaNovember 29, 2020UserFantastic smart watch great looking worth every penny.
WayneApril 13, 2021UserVery happy with my Withings Scanwatch. The health features are amazing, the watch is extremely comfortable and I love that it looks elegant and not like the usual chunky smart watches.
WendyFebruary 5, 2021UserThe ScanWatch is simple, clever and unobtrusive. It does what I need it to do with vibration notifications, health, sleep and activity monitoring in a stylish and easy to manage package. I love the traditional watch face. Battery life is amazing and the Health app is comprehensive. It has made a difference to my health already.
Wendy WFebruary 21, 2021UserGreat watch, I love it. It looks nice, is great to use.
Willy SilbersteinJanuary 11, 2021UserNot bad, finding it useful and will visit my cardiologist today after automatic records of my heart function. Recommended as a health monitor.
WojciechFebruary 23, 2021UserReally good thing. I recommend this watch.
WojtekApril 28, 2021UserThis is a very advanced device and I love that it integrates many products onto one app, like Whitings scale which I love and other tools as well.
WTPMay 3, 2021UserScanWatch is my second watch from Withings and its a really good watch. The build quality feels much better than their previous watches and screen is much better too.The watch works great with the app and the information is easy to find. I bought the watch to track my fitness activities and its okay at that. The heart rate jumps around a bit if you do something where you move your arms erratically, like boxing and possibly tennis. It's perfect for regular activities like walking, running and hiking.I wouldn't mind if the watch also had the ability to check temperature :)YunkiMarch 1, 2021UserThe best function in a smartwatch that looks like a normal one (could be weared in meetings and gala events as it looks good) and be used like a normal one (as it won't need daily charging).
Zeno AmtmannJanuary 9, 2021UserGreat way to track health with amazing battery lifeAnonymized userMarch 16, 2021UserThis device is simply smart and easy to use. Moreover it is classically elegant..!!MohanAugust 11, 2021UserBig improvement making it re-chargeable, comparing my previous ECG Move watch. Step counting accuracy can be further improved. Watch face is very elegant but could be better having every minutes marked.
Karoly LugosiAugust 9, 2021UserOverall very happy with the product. Only disappointment is the data from workouts varies considerably from the iFit program I use and doesn't record distance for eliptical machine. Really like the features such as afib detection and oxygen monitoring.
SteverAugust 27, 2021UserWatch is very goodBrettSeptember 2, 2021UserGreat combination of a classic luxurious watch and a smartwatch. Nice looking with great health features, could be better after time with the necessary updates. A Real watch unlike the "toy" watches the competition offers at the moment.
George PlakiasSeptember 8, 2021UserWithings ScanWatch provides all the digital integration whilst still providing a watch that looks great at a dinner partyMikeSeptember 12, 2021UserThe ScanWatch is a very interesting concept, with some features that are highly useful such as the oxygen saturation level in EKG feature. However, you cannot entirely trust the EKG feature as I think it is still unproven. Additionally, it's results can be inconsistent from one test to the next. It is very accurate as to exercise and this is a good feature. It gives you sleep data but I'm not sure how useful the information is. There's no way to analyze the sleek data once you have it. Particularly, it doesn't tell you whether you're in REM sleep or not. However, in summary, any data that helps you toward better health is useful information.

August 6, 2021UserIt's a nice package, with good battery. Could benefit a for from refining the notifications implementation, and sleep analysis feature.
Tiago CarrolaAugust 7, 2021UserScanwatch is the best offering Withings yet. Battery life is easy 25 days even activating tilt display on. More accurate step tracks than Steel HR. Afib and Sp02 are the best assuring features but this watch has flawless connectivity and the HealthMate App. This is important because my other smartwatch (famous brand) has connectivity issues. Finally the watch is simply beautiful and elegant to wear and see. It is also comfortable. WithingsPay and Independent GPS will make it perfect!AlexAugust 8, 2021UserThe ScanWatch is a great update to the Steel HR. Larger face, more functions, and an easier to navigate push crown make it an easy choice to buy.
Withings userAugust 15, 2021UserThis is my third Withings upgrade. Love that it looks like a regular watch but is secretly monitoring my every move.
SarahAugust 6, 2021UserThe watch is beautiful and extremely functional. I love the classic look of it -- I'm really impressed with its feature set. I've been using the watch for a few months now, and I've really gotten used to its subtle appeal.
EntreeAugust 16, 2021UserBeautiful watch with all the necessary health features. Easily connected to the app and long battery life. You need to bring along your phone for gps though.
AnnaAugust 18, 2021UserHaving had a smartwatch for over a year, I needed to up my game and go for one that had superior battery life and functionality. The Withings ScanWatch is exactly that. It looks like a sophisticated analogue watch but has all the smart features you need. It's classy, understated, good loooking and intelligent. A bit like me!David FernandoAugust 21, 2021UserThis watch gave me he right mix of features, look and battery.
eslideitSeptember 1, 2021UserThank youTriSeptember 1, 2021UserGreat fitness watch, the larger model is perfect for my big wrist, the battery life is outstanding.
