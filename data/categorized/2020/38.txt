Dec 4, 2020Standing with Dr. Timnit Gebru — #ISupportTimnit #BelieveBlackWomenWe, the undersigned, stand in solidarity with Dr. Timnit Gebru, who wasterminatedfrom her position as Staff Research Scientist and Co-Lead of Ethical Artificial Intelligence (AI) team at Google, following unprecedented research censorship. We call on Google Research to strengthen its commitment to research integrity and to unequivocally commit to supporting research that honors the commitments made in Google’sAI Principles.
Until December 2, 2020, Dr. Gebru was one of very few Black women Research Scientists at the company, which boasts a dismal1.6% Black women employees overall. Her researchaccomplishmentsare extensive, and have profoundly impacted academic scholarship and public policy. Dr. Gebru is a pathbreaking scientist doing some of the most important work to ensure just and accountable AI and to create a welcoming and diverse AI research field.
Instead of being embraced by Google as an exceptionally talented and prolific contributor, Dr. Gebru has faced defensiveness, racism, gaslighting, research censorship, and now a retaliatory firing. In anemailto Dr. Gebru’s team on the evening of December 2, 2020, Google executives claimed that she had chosen to resign. This is false. In their direct correspondence with Dr. Gebru, these executivesinformedher that her termination was immediate, and pointed to anemailshe sent to a Google Brain diversity and inclusion mailing list as pretext.
The contents of this email are important. In it, Dr. Gebru pushed back against Google’s censorship of her (and her colleagues’) research, which focused on examining the environmental and ethical implications of large-scale AI language models (LLMs), which are used in many Google products. Dr. Gebru and her colleagues worked for months on a paper that was under review at an academic conference. In late November, five weeks after the piece had been internally reviewed and approved for publication through standard processes, Google leadership made the decision to censor it, without warning or cause. Dr. Gebru asked them to explain this decision and to take accountability for it, and for their lackluster stand on discriminatory and harassing workplace conditions. The termination is an act of retaliation against Dr. Gebru, and it heralds danger for people working for ethical and just AI — especially Black people and People of Color — across Google.
Research integrity can no longer be taken for granted in Google’s corporate research environment, and Dr. Gebru’s firing has overthrown a working understanding of what kind of research Google will permit. This is also a moment of reckoning beyond Google. As we know, Dr. Gebru is one of the few people exerting pressure from the inside against the unethical and undemocratic incursion of powerful and biased technologies into our daily lives. This is a public service, and its importance cannot be overstated. Google’s retaliation against Dr. Gebru, and its move to silence this work, concerns us all.
We have the following demands of Google Research leadership:To add your name to the list of academic, civil society, and industry supporters (Googlers, see go/stand-with-timnit):Signed,2695 Googlers and 4302 academic, industry, and civil society supportersGooglers include:@zigdon, Senior SREA.
