GalleryITER achieves major liftOn 11 May 2022, the ITER Organization team achieves a major assembly milestone: lifting the first sub-section of the ITER plasma chamber out of tooling and lowering it into the machine well.
11 May 2022Months of practice and preparationFrom one of the "command centres," looking through a port cell window out into the Tokamak pit, where the first section of the ITER plasma chamber is slowly descending toward waiting supports. The DYNAMIC consortium (Ansaldo Nucleare; Endel Engie; Orys Group ORTEC; SIMIC; Ansaldo Energia; and Leading Metal Mechanic Solutions SL) is ITER's TAC2 assembly contractor (for Tokamak Assembly Contractor 2), in charge of sector sub-assembly, and assembly of the main vessel and ports including welding.
11 May 2022Most complex lift to dateThe 1,380-tonne assembly (component plus rigging) is six storeys high and weighs the equivalent of four fully loaded Boeing 747s. The lift operation achieved today was the most complex of ITER machine assembly to date.
11 May 2022Over the wall, with only 20 cm to spareThe massive component—representing one-ninth of the ITER plasma chamber—was extracted from its assembly tool, rotated, transferred over the bioshield wall (with only 20 cm to spare), and lowered into the Tokamak pit.
11 May 2022The first of nine similar "sub-assemblies"The "piece" of the ITER machine installed today is a modular assembly, formed from one 40° vacuum vessel sector fitted with silver-coated thermal shields, and two D-shaped vertical superconducting electromagnets called toroidal field coils. Eight other similar assemblies will form the complete chamber and surrounding toroidal field coil superstructure.
11 May 2022There they areOn 5 May, in a pre-lift test, the sector module is lifted 50 centimetres above its supports. This small distance is visible below the rectangular structure illuminated by the green pointer's beam at the centre of the image.
05 May 2022WowEach of the bridge crane's four hooks can be seen to support loads of approximately 345 tonnes (two totals are visible in this image). The total weight of the sector module plus its rigging apparatus is in the range of 1,380 tonnes—the equivalent of four fully loaded Boeing 747s.
05 May 2022Pre-lift: a successThe pre-lift operation on Thursday 5 May was a partial rehearsal for the big lift to come, testing the tools, sequences, and coordination. For the ITER Organization and DYNAMIC teams that participated, it was a success.
05 May 2022Only 50 cm, but ...
Lifting the 1,380-tonne load (module + rigging) a mere 50 centimetres required the participation of dozens of specialists from the ITER Organization and the DYNAMIC SNC consortium (in charge of the TAC2 machine assembly contract covering the main vessel and ports, sector sub-assembly with toroidal field coils and vacuum vessel thermal shielding, and welding: more information at https://www.iter.org/construction/TokamakAssembly).
05 May 2022Watching the instrumentsAlthough it represented only a fraction of what the actual operation will require, the "pre-lifting" of the sector assembly on Thursday 5 May permitted the thorough testing of every instrument that will be involved in the major move to come.

03 May 2022The golden hourEvening is upon us and the teams working to prepare sector module #6 for transfer have turned on some extra lighting ...
02 May 2022A second sub-assembly underwayToroidal field coil #9 (TF9) from Europe has been mounted on one of the standing tools. Through the rotary motion of the wing, the coil will be brought toward the vacuum vessel sector at the centre and attached.
29 April 2022Sector assembly lineThermal shield panels have been pivoted to the vacuum vessel sector in the foreground and attached. A toroidal field coil from Europe is already held vertically in tooling, ready to be transferred across and installed on one of the tool's wings.
25 April 2022A, B then CThe purpose-built central solenoid module lift tool (bottom left) is ready to exert a radial force on the first 110-tonne magnet module (top left) in order to lift it to the central solenoid assembly platform (top right). This operation is planned before the end of April 2022.
25 April 2022"The beam" is in placeA new scaffolding element called "the beam" has been installed above the Tokamak pit (to the right). This 28-metre-long structure will allow for the installation of the cable trays and ventilation ducts. More on the challenge of scaffolding at ITER here: https://www.iter.org/newsline/-/3745.
25 April 2022BustlingThe busy ITER Assembly Hall. Only 97 metres long and 60 metres wide ... and a lot of pre-assembly activities to house.
25 April 2022Toroidal field coil #9 goes verticalIn the ITER Assembly Hall, the overhead bridge cranes are used to raise a 330-tonne toroidal field coil, tightly lashed inside the upending frame, to vertical. The coil will be moved across the Hall to join vacuum vessel sector #1(7).
25 April 2022At the centre of it allTwo workers stand in the central Tokamak pit, a 30-metre-tall x 30-metre-wide space where the assembly of the ITER machine is proceeding from bottom up.
22 April 2022All it takesA vacuum vessel sector, two toroidal field coils, thermal shield segments... that's all it takes to assemble a 1,250-tonne "sector module." In the Assembly Hall, barely visible in the background, sector module #6 is ready to be installed in the Tokamak pit; in the foreground, sector module #1(7) has entered the pre-assembly process.
08 April 2022Sector #8 uncoveredSector #8, recently delivered by the Korean Domestic Agency, has been removed from its transport housing and placed on temporary supports.
08 April 2022From the upper galleriesAt 55 metres above the floor, the gangway offers a spectacular view of the Assembly Hall's ever-changing landscape. In this 6,000-square-metre building, components are unloaded, received, equipped, and handled prior to being lifted into the Tokamak assembly pit.
08 April 2022Central solenoid "corner"Delivered in September 2021, the first of the six modules required for the central solenoid magnet sits between the lifting fixture (holding an orange mockup) and the assembly platform (grey). The six modules will be stacked one atop the other in order to form the 18-metre tall, 1,000-tonne magnet.
08 April 2022Third time aroundLike sectors #6 and #1(7), this vacuum vessel sector (#8) will be first be inspected, then equipped with fasteners, instrumentation and diagnostics before moving on to a vertical position in sub-assembly tooling. With repetition, these operations are carried out with ever more efficiency.
07 April 2022Start of shiftIt is a bit after 1:00 p.m. in the vast ITER Cleaning Facility and second-shift workers from the CNPE consortium are assembled for their daily briefing. As they stand to attention, a foreman in a green helmet, bullhorn in hand, communicates the objectives of the day, describes the co-activity they will encounter, and emphasizes the importance of strictly observing safety rules. The CNPE consortium is one of two ITER machine assembly contractors (more at: https://www.iter.org/construction/TokamakAssembly).
01 April 2022Sector #8 enters the stageVacuum vessel sector #8, recently arrived from Korea, is the third sector to enter the ITER assembly buildings (pictured: the Cleaning Facility). The project is expecting six more sectors (one from Korea and five from Europe).
01 April 2022Before the double doors openBefore the double doors into the Assembly Hall open to admit vacuum vessel sector #8, from Korea, the transport container is cleaned with high-power washers.
01 April 2022Central columnInside of the Tokamak pit, where the central column tool is ready to receive the first 1,200-tonne section of the vacuum vessel. The beam connected to the top of the section will brace between the central column and the surrounding wall.
15 March 2022Taking care of scaffoldingA dedicated team on site takes care of the assembly and disassembly of all scaffolding. For scaffolding operations in the Tokamak pit, such as this assembly around the central column of the in-pit column tool, a carbon-free kit is necessary. The team now has almost 100 tonnes of carbon-free material on hand after developing and procuring it especially for ITER's needs.
15 March 2022Demand for scaffolding is increasingAs construction and assembly accelerate at ITER, the demand for scaffolding is increasing. There are currently about 800 scaffolds in use on the site and every month there are more than 300 new scaffolding jobs that need to be done, without considering the modification and dismantling tasks.
15 March 2022"The beam"This 28-metre-long scaffolding structure known as ''the beam'' will be installed above the Tokamak pit to allow for the completion of cable trays and ventilation ducts.
15 March 2022Scaffolding: always changingScaffolding. Imagine you have a massive Lego kit with 1,600 different types of references and you need to build hundreds of one-of-a-kind structures while facing challenging deadlines ...
15 March 2022Custom designed for the SSAT1 toolThis scaffolding was specifically designed to give contractors access to all parts of the sector sub-assembly tool SSAT1 in the Assembly Hall. The ITER construction team works with Construction Management-as-Agent contractor MOMENTUM and scaffolding contractor Entrepose Echafaudages to design and build these specialized projects.
15 March 2022300 specialized jointsApproximately 300 superconducting feeder joints need to be created as part of assembling the magnet feeders on site at ITER. These highly critical joints require special qualification and training to carry out. See more at https://www.iter.org/newsline/-/3726.
01 March 2022In one corner of the Assembly HallThis is the first ITER central solenoid module to enter the assembly process. As the yellow lifting tools and devices are progressively removed from the module on the left, the platform to the right is being equipped for the first assembly steps.
28 February 2022Another bottom coilA small superconducting magnet, a bottom correction coil, is inserted into the space at the bottom of the Tokamak pit between ring coil PF6 (hidden under staging at left) and PF5 (right).
15 February 2022A simple tableEquipment and tests will be performed on this simple ''table'' before the module is moved over to the assembly platform, visible on the right side of the image.
10 February 2022Powerful ductsAgainst the backdrop of the travelling module are ducts belonging to the Assembly Hall's powerful HVAC system. The Assembly Building will be operated as a clean space for the duration of machine assembly.
10 February 2022TravellingOnce six modules are stacked and assembled, the ITER central solenoid will be placed at the very centre of the Tokamak pit where the central column (a temporary assembly tool) presently stands.
10 February 2022First central solenoid module aloftA 110-tonne central solenoid module is moved to the far end of the Assembly Hall for tests on its instrumentation, sensors and superconducting joints.
10 February 2022Careful preparationThe team spent more than one hour preparing the load for the lift. It was essential to avoid any contact between the rigging and the electrical connections on the central solenoid module.
10 February 2022Sector alleyAgainst the backdrop of vacuum vessel sector assembly, CNPE* consortium members are preparing to move a 100-tonne central solenoid module. (China Nuclear Power Engineering = China Nuclear Industry 23 Construction Company Ltd.; Southwestern Institute of Physics; Institute of Plasma Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences ASIPP; and Framatome). More on assembly contractors here: https://www.iter.org/construction/TokamakAssembly10 February 2022Careful adjustmentThe workers in the cherry picker will adjust strap lengths, millimetre by millimetre, so that the 110-tonne central solenoid module will be perfectly balanced and the lift perfectly vertical.
10 February 2022Tasks in the Assembly HallThe two main machine assembly contractors (CNPE and DYNAMIC) have learned to share tooling and common services in an efficient manner as they execute work packages under the oversight of ITER Organization and MOMENTUM (Construction Management-as-Agent) teams.
10 February 2022Calling downWork is underway on the second vacuum vessel sub-assembly, with technicians at every level.
03 February 2022Working on a 2nd sub-assemblyThe teams are working on the second vacuum vessel sub-assembly. In this tool we see sector #1(which will be placed next to sector #6 in the pit in position 7) and an outboard thermal shield panel on the left. The thermal shield will be rotated toward the vacuum vessel sector and attached in place.
19 January 2022Pieces all alignedLike Erector set or Meccano parts, components and tools for ITER machine assembly cover the floor of the vast hall that serves as an antechamber to the Tokamak pit.
17 January 2022Second sector assembly underwayA second 440-tonne vacuum vessel sector, #1(7), is positioned vertically in the tooling for sub-assembly with other major components (a pair of vertical coils and thermal shield panels). Far to the right, the first completed sub-assembly (around sector #6) waits for transfer this month into the Tokamak pit.
03 January 20222 sectors of 9One sub-assembly is ready (far end), another is in the early stages. A third vacuum vessel sector sub-assembly will be built around Korean sector #8, which will leave Hyundai Heavy Industries later this month. Nine sectors in all will form the ITER machine torus (4 from Korea and 5 from Europe).
03 January 2022Assembly rowTWO vacuum vessels sectors are docked in Assembly Hall tooling. One has completed the pre-assembly sequence (far end); the other is at the start. Two identical sub-assembly tools were planned to keep this critical stage of machine assembly moving.
21 December 2021Pit is readyThe 30-metre-deep Tokamak pit is ready to receive its first 40-degree vacuum vessel section. As the sections begin to fill up the space the hollow central column, equipped with ladders and access ports, will be used to reach different levels of the emerging torus.
20 December 2021Second sector dockedSector #1(7) has been docked in the sub-assembly tool SSAT1. Work begins now to pair the sector with approximately 880 tonnes of additional components (two magnet coils and thermal shielding), creating a perfect 40-degree section of the ITER torus.
20 December 2021Strong backThe standing sub-assembly tool will support the weight of the 440-tonne component for several months, as thermal shielding and two toroidal field coils are attached.
20 December 2021Transfer dayOn 20 December 2021, the second vacuum vessel sector to arrive from Korea (called #1(7)) is lifted out of the upending tool and into the standing assembly tooling.
20 December 2021Next?Next up: the sector will be lifted out of the tool, rotated, and installed on the assembly tool we see at left.
08 December 2021Lower slowlyOnce vertical, the upending tool and its load are returned to the shop floor. The tool has been specifically designed to upend 9 vacuum vessel sectors and 18 toroidal field coils, or 27 lifts in all. This is number four.
08 December 2021Up closeThe sector is 11 metres tall ; the tool is even taller.
08 December 2021Hold tightThe component is lashed tightly so that it doesn't budge an inch during the upending operation.
08 December 2021Mid-air balletIt's an industrial ballet in mid-air.
08 December 2021HeftyThe tool weighs 250 tonnes itself. Adding the vacuum vessel sector and rigging, that's nearly 700 tonnes under the cranes.
08 December 2021One week laterOne week later, the crane rigging is altered to bring the upending tool to vertical.
08 December 2021A busy hallOn the far end, sector #1(7) is inserted into the upending tool, right across from the tall sector sub-assembly tool that is its next destination. In the middle, two bottom correction coils are prepped for installation in the Tokamak pit. In the foreground, the central solenoid assembly platform is ready for the first module.
02 December 2021Fine tuningThe vacuum vessel sector is now inside the upending tool. Fine-tuning of the lifting system was performed by four hydraulic ''sync hoists'' attached to a pair of load-balancing beams suspended to the crane hooks.
02 December 2021Into its cradleThe 440-tonne sector, securely strapped to its staging platform, is lowered into the upending tool. Next week, it will be raised to vertical.
02 December 2021Second sector on the moveVacuum vessel sector #1(7) is on the move. On Thursday 2 December it was lifted into the upending tool. See the full story in the ITER Newsline on 6 December.
02 December 2021Second sector in the wingsAnother imminent operation at ITER: the lifting of the second Korean sector, #1(7), into the assembly tooling. The teams were able to prep this sector for lifting in half the time as the first.
19 November 2021Sector #1(7): prep work underwayIn order to support the instrumentation that monitors the main electromagnetic parameters of the plasma, several hundred welded attachments (i.e., bosses or clips) need to be precisely fitted to every vacuum vessel sector. (Pictured: Korean sector #1(7))19 November 2021Faster the second time aroundExperience and lessons learned brought the total duration of preparation works on the second vacuum vessel sector down from 36 weeks to an expected 15 to 17 weeks.
19 November 2021Only six more "steps"The path to lowering the first vacuum vessel sub-assembly into the Tokamak pit was set out in 27 distinct construction work packages, and 21 of these have now been achieved. (Read more about the 27 "steps" in this article: https://www.iter.org/newsline/-/3642.) The transfer of the sub-assembly into the Tokamak pit will be a major project milestone.
18 November 2021Next lift into pit: 1,250 tonnesITER's first vacuum vessel sub-assembly is nearly ready for transfer into the Tokamak pit. Together, the sub-assembly components weigh 1,250 tonnes.
15 November 2021AwesomeWorkers look small when they stand at the foot of this unique and spectacular D-shaped structure.

This view of the lower machine will be impossible in a few weeks, when the first vacuum vessel sub-assembly is inserted. © Les Nouveaux Médias/SNC ENGAGE29 October 2021Central solenoid assembly to begin in January 2022Delivered to ITER in September, the first central solenoid module is undergoing a battery of tests and verifications—metrology, sensors, electrical insulation inspection, etc. Assembly of the 18-metre tall, 1,000-tonne central solenoid is set to begin in January 2022.
21 October 2021SuccessThe lowering of the BCC/4 coil onto its temporary supports goes smoothly, thanks to detailed preparation that included metrology, reverse engineering and accurate positioning. In the final machine geometry, the correction coils will be attached to the toroidal field coil superstructure.
21 October 2021Just a sliver of spaceFinal touch down is the most critical part of the lift. The "sliver" of space between poloidal field coil #5, poloidal field coil #6, lower magnet feeders, and staging platforms does not exceed 25 mm for BCC/4 (pictured) and 15 mm for BCC/5.
21 October 2021Kidney-shapedCorrection coils are manufactured in unusual shapes to fit into the space between the poloidal and toroidal field magnets. At the bottom and the top of the machine, the coils are rectangles that curve inward to espouse the torus shape of the vacuum vessel.
21 October 2021TeamworkITER Organization teams are working with the Tokamak Assembly Contract (TAC1) consortium CNPE for the correction coil lift operations.

The total load under the crane is 5.3 tonnes including lift accessories.
21 October 2021Second tool enters actionOn the sector sub-assembly tool #2 (SSAT2), we are counting down the days until the first sub-assembly (built around vacuum vessel sector #6) is transferred to the Tokamak pit. Meanwhile, on SSAT1, assembly contractors have mounted the inboard segment of the thermal shield. On this tall tool, a sub-assembly unit will be built around vacuum vessel sector #7.
20 October 2021First correction coilsTwo out of six bottom correction coils have completed site acceptance tests are are in line for pit insertion. The Chinese Domestic Agency is supplying 18 correction coils in all (six bottom, six side and six top).
07 October 2021Assembly precisionThe elements of the first vacuum vessel sub-assembly are positioned precisely relative to one another. To the right, the bottom of one of the toroidal field coils (TF13); in the centre, the much thinner silver-plated thermal shield; and to the left, the opening of the vacuum vessel sector lower port stub extension.
05 October 2021Sub-assembly #1: final alignment achievedFinal alignment has been achieved for the first building block of the ITER plasma chamber—four major components, totalling 1,250 tonnes, have been aligned to within 1 mm of tolerance in the radial, toroidal and vertical directions. (Picture taken inside of the sub-assembly group.)05 October 2021New thermal shield setContractors have unpacked the three thermal shield panels that will be mounted onto vacuum vessel sector #1(7)—the second sector to be equipped. (Pictured: the inboard sector.) All nine sets of vacuum vessel thermal shielding are on site. © Christian Luenig (www.arbeitsblende.de)01 October 2021Hidden corridorTo exit the ground floor of the Tokamak pit, you have to pass under poloidal field coil #5. © Christian Luenig (www.arbeitsblende.de)29 September 2021Ring coil PF5 is in placeThe coil has now reached its "parking position," where it will remain for a few years. When all vacuum vessel sectors are in place, it will be raised approximately 1.5 metres to its permanent position.
16 September 2021A pause for metrologyPart of the way down, the load is paused in order for metrologists to take measurements. It must be positionned at the bottom within a few millimetres of tolerance.
15 September 2021Altitude 35 metresThe coil is now approximately 35 metres above its final position. Its diameter is just a few centimetres smaller than the lower cryostat thermal shield that is visible (wrapped in protective pink plastic) at the bottom of the pit.
15 September 2021Another major magnet installedRight on time, the assembly teams lower poloidal field coil #5 into the Tokamak pit. This magnet, which is captive under the machine, needed to be in place before the first vacuum vessel sub-assembly is lowered late next month.
15 September 2021Created on site by EuropePoloidal field coil #5 is the first magnet to exit the Poloidal Field Coils Winding Facility, a production facility created on site by the European Domestic Agency for the realization of four of the five ring-shaped magnets under its responsibility. (The fifth, poloidal field coil #6) was produced at the Chinese institute ASIPP under an agreement with Europe.)15 September 2021Planarity checkPoloidal field coil #5: Lifting and positioning a 17-metre-in-diameter steel coil demands a perfect balancing of the lifting hooks and a constant check for planarity.
15 September 2021Early morning briefingApproximately 20 workers from the machine assembly consortium CNPE, two crane operators and four ITER Organization supervisors were involved in the operation.
15 September 2021Home at lastThe first central solenoid module to arrive on site enters the antechamber of the Assembly Hall, where it will be stored until the second module arrives.
09 September 2021Using the column for accessAt the base of the central column tool, the first work platform has been installed. Platforms will be installed at three other levels, with access possible through the hollow interior of the column (equipped with ladders).
08 September 2021UnpackedThe latest vacuum vessel sector to arrive at ITER—sector #1(7)—has been positioned in the Assembly Hall and unwrapped.
07 September 2021Good fitThe test operation demonstrated that the docking and bolting of the test beam fell within the required tolerances.
07 September 2021Preparing for a big lift next monthThe first vacuum vessel sector should be ready for transfer to the pit late October, fully assembled with its thermal shielding and two toroidal field coils. It will travel into place under a radial beam that will brace its its weight between the column and the wall. In early September, this docking operation was tested without load.
07 September 2021A spaceship?The shape of an in-pit radial beam is strongly evocative of slim spaceship—the bow turned toward its destination, an upper deck gangway, and openings in its hull like rocket exhausts.
07 September 2021First sub-assembly underwayThe assembly teams are creating the first vacuum vessel sub-assembly in one of the tall tools in the Assembly Hall. Vacuum vessel sector #6, seen from below covered by its shiny thermal shield, will be paired with toroidal field coils TF11 (left) and TF12 (right). The completely integrated unit, weighing 1,200 tonnes, will be lowered into the Tokamak pit in late October.
07 September 2021The antechamber of the tokamakBefore being assembled in the Tokamak pit, all large components are brought through this space: the ITER Assembly Hall. Their sojourn in this space can be long or short, depending on the number of pre-assembly activities required to prepare the components for lifting.
07 September 2021Central columnA central column is being erected in the centre of the Tokamak pit. It will help support the vacuum vessel sector sub-assemblies as they are welded together.
01 September 2021Rotation is next stepFor now, this D-shaped magnet coil (left) is supported from below. Once it is rotated to the vacuum vessel sector (right) and attached, the load can be transferred.
30 August 2021RevealedThe metal housing is lifted and ... voilà! ... the 440-tonne sector is revealed.
30 August 2021Inspection underwayDelivered on Friday 27 August, sector #1(7) was unpacked the next day. In this image, members of the vacuum vessel team are carrying out a first visual inspection prior to removing the component's protective plastic wrapping.
30 August 2021Second vacuum vessel sector receivedVacuum vessel sector #1(7) from Korea enters the Cleaning Facility. It is just a few hundred metres from its final destination.
27 August 2021Assembling a puzzleA vacuum vessel sector sub-assembly tool is photographed from an overhead crane. All the pieces are in place to assemble the first section of the ITER vacuum vessel.
24 August 2021Shiny surfacesIf you look closely into this V-shaped tool, you'll see the components that must be associated: the triangular form of the vacuum vessel sector (centre, shiny) already covered in panels of thermal shielding, and toroidal field coils on wings to either side. At the top of the image, poloidal field coil #5 stands ready for installation in the pit.
24 August 2021Second vertical coil delivered to toolTo the right of the image, the newly installed toroidal field coil. To the left, vacuum vessel sector #6. (A second vertical coil is out of sight to the left.)12 August 2021Ready for coil number 2Two days after the transfer of coil TF12 to the standing tool, its twin—TF13—was raised to vertical and delivered to the opposite wing. Vacuum vessel sector #6 now has a toroidal field coil on each side.
12 August 2021From one tool to the otherSince 15 June, this toroidal field coil had been stored vertically on one of the wings of SSAT1 (the first vacuum vessel sector sub-assembly tool to be erected in the Assembly Hall). On 10 August, it was moved by overhead crane to the SSAT2 tool, where teams are preparing to create the first vacuum vessel sub-assembly.
10 August 2021Vertical balletToroidal field coil #12 (TF12) is rotated in mid-air to approach its final destination on the wind of the standing tool in the proper position.
10 August 2021Horizontal coil PF5 ready for positioningA major lift operation will take place in mid-September, as the second poloidal field coil (PF5, pictured) is installed in the Tokamak pit.
10 August 2021Vertical coil moved into placeToroidal field coil #12 (supplied by Japan) is moved out of temporary storage on one standing assembly tool and into the other, where all the action is ready to begin. To form a sub-assembly ready for installation in the machine pit, a vacuum vessel sector must be pre-assembled with two toroidal field coils and panels of thermal shielding.
10 August 2021Second ring coil in line for installationManufactured on site by Europe, poloidal field coil #5 left the production line in April. The component was three and a half years in the making. On 26 July 2021, it was brought into the Assembly Hall, to be prepped for installation in the Tokamak pit.
26 July 2021Next major component to be installedA lead actor enters the stage: poloidal field coil #5, 17 metres in diameter, is one the six ring-shaped coils required for the machine.
26 July 2021A quick swapThe overhead cranes of the Assembly Hall were required to move this toroidal field coil (TF3, from Europe) from its transport frame to a storage frame.
12 July 2021First pre-compression rings installedA set of three spare pre-compression rings made of glass fibre/epoxy composite are installed in the Tokamak pit on Thursday 8 July. Two other sets of three rings will tightly hold the toroidal field coils at top and bottom with a radial force of 7,000 tonnes per coil to push back against expansion forces during operation.
08 July 2021Tight spaceThe set of three spare pre-compression rings was installed in the tight space between the bottom cylinder of the central column tool and the recently installed poloidal field coil #6.
08 July 2021The pit, early JulySixteen of the eighteen toroidal field coil gravity supports are in place in a circle on the cryostat base. Next to be installed? A set of three pre-compression rings around the central column.
02 July 2021Sub-assembly progressingIn the Assembly Hall, the first vacuum vessel sector sub-assembly operation is underway. On the left tool, a vacuum vessel sector has been paired with thermal shielding. On the right, one D-shaped toroidal field coil waits to be transferred over. (Another is ready for vertical upending and installation.) A sub-assembly marries one sector, inboard and outboard thermal shield panels, and two toroidal field coils.
02 July 2021Creating a "sub-assembly"This coil, TF13, will join TF12 on the sector sub-assembly tooling to be matched with vacuum vessel sector #6 and thermal shielding. Both coils were supplied by Japan.
02 July 2021Musical chairsA toroidal field coil (TF13) lays horizontal on a frame in the Assembly Hall. Soon, it will be moved to the upending tool to be raised to vertical.
02 July 2021Preserving all installed componentsPreservation activities are defined for each component that needs to be maintained in good condition prior to entering service. In this photo, a worker performs a "white cloth test" to check for moisture on a cryostat support bearing during a preservation inspection. (Find out more at: https://www.iter.org/newsline/-/3630)28 June 2021Rotated inwardThe outboard thermal shield sections have been rotated in by the tooling, and they match perfectly. (Photo courtesy of Chang Hyun Noh.)26 June 2021Seen from the backA 40-degree sector of the ITER vacuum vessel is photographed in the sub-assembly tool from behind. Two outboard panels of thermal shielding are ready to be rotated inward and affixed, perfectly matching the shape and openings of the sector. (Courtesy of Chang Hyun Noh.)23 June 2021From belowSeen from under the sector. The right and left outboard sectors are already attached on the wings of the tool; they will be rotated inward to meet and match perfectly, leaving no part of the vacuum vessel visible.
21 June 2021Thermal shield installedYou have to look twice to see it: the inboard thermal shield section has been clamped to vacuum vessel sector #6. Only its colour, shiny silver, permits us to distinguish it from the background grey of the vacuum vessel.
21 June 2021Specialized tool requiredThe thermal shield is designed to fit like a glove. Little by little, the tool introduces the inboard panel behind the vacuum vessel.
21 June 2021SmoothThe operation went smoothly, with no show-stopper, no physical mismatching, and no major adjustments required. It was an important rehearsal for the identical sequences to follow. In only two weeks, TF13 (also from Japan) will follow the same path.
15 June 2021First toroidal field coil in toolingIn a series of operations that started on Wednesday 9 June and concluded six days later, TF12 was successfully attached to the left wing of one the twin sector sub-assembly tools (SSAT-1). The 320-tonne coil will be moved to SSAT-2 in about a month for the start of pre-assembly operations with vacuum vessel sector #6 (visible to the far right).
15 June 2021Crossing the HallToroidal field coil #12 (supplied by Japan) crosses the Hall to be installed on the left wing of the first sector sub-assembly tool (SSAT-1). The component will remain in this temporary location for about a month, before it is moved to the other sector sub-assembly tool (SSAT-2) for the actual pre-assembly operations.
15 June 2021Ready to removeTime to lift the 320-tonne vertical coil from its upending frame and transfer it over to one of the sector sub-assembly tools on the opposite side of the Hall.
15 June 2021The team in chargeResponsible for the operation today is the DYNAMIC SNC consortium (Ansaldo Nucleare; Endel Engie; Orys Group ORTEC; SIMIC; Ansaldo Energia; and Leading Metal Mechanic Solutions SL). As TAC-2 contractor (for Tokamak Assembly Contract 2) for the ITER Organization, DYNAMIC is in charge of the assembly of the main vessel and ports, sector sub-assembly with toroidal field coils and vacuum vessel thermal shielding, and welding.
15 June 2021Next in lineA second toroidal field is ready to enter the Assembly Hall: TF11 from Japan. © Les Nouveaux Médias/SNC ENGAGE15 June 2021SatisfactionThe team can be satisfied with work well done. The next step is to "detach" toroidal field coil #12 from the upending tool and perform the balancing of the load under the cranes, before it is moved to the sector sub-assembly tooling.
09 June 2021First of 18Eighteen "D"-shaped toroidal field magnets placed around the vacuum vessel produce a magnetic field whose primary function is to confine the plasma particles.
09 June 2021For the first vacuum vessel sub-assemblySeventeen metres tall and 9 metres wide, this D-shaped coil (TF12, procured by Japan) is one of two that will be matched with a 40-degree sector of the ITER vacuum vessel. Sector #6 is already in the SSAT assembly tooling; TF12 will be transferred to the tooling next week.
09 June 2021Watching from belowWatching as the 200-tonne upending frame and its 360-tonne load are raised to vertical.
09 June 2021Let's goBy coordinating the cables of the four lift points, the overhead crane operators first lift the load and then start to tilt it.
09 June 2021Ready to goThe teams are ready to perform the first "upending" of a D-shaped toroidal field coil (TF12). The upending tool (light grey) can handle both vacuum vessel sectors and vertical coils.
09 June 2021A vast hallThe upending tool is located in the middle of the Assembly Hall, not far from the sector sub-assembly tools.
09 June 2021Near readyThis correction coil feeder element is already in the lift frame that will be used for its transfer into the pit.
09 June 2021Temporary rest areaThe newly arrived load is transferred to a temporary laydown area. Later, in the order determined by assembly sequences, it will be transferred to the Tokamak pit.
09 June 2021Up it goesThe new feeder element (wrapped in silver) and its transport frame are lifted off the transporter. In the foreground, another (unwrapped) feeder component awaits its turn in the assembly pit.
09 June 2021Points d'attacheTechnicians attach crane hooks to the transport frame in order to lift the component and free the modular transporter.
09 June 2021Open sesameThe massive doors of the Assembly Hall open to admit a semi-circular feeder component on its self-propelled modular transporter.
09 June 2021Stacking ringsAssembly contractors are preparing for the lift of two sets of three pre-compression rings. © Les Nouveaux Médias/SNC ENGAGE08 June 2021Bottom to topITER machine assembly is proceeding from bottom to top. After the 1,250-tonne cryostat base comes: the lower cryostat components; nine large, 40° vacuum vessel sectors (pre-assembled with thermal shield panels and a pair of toroidal field coils); components at the top of the machine; and finally the cryostat lid.
04 June 2021Looking like microwave ovensTwo "front full" support thermal shield panels are in place in front of the toroidal field coil gravity supports. A "front open" panel will be precisely fitted between them. The system is designed to shield the magnets at cryogenic temperature from the warmth coming from the cryostat base and transmitted by the gravity supports.
04 June 2021A unique placeNothing in the world remotely resembles the ITER "assembly pit." What we see here are the first steps of a prodigious undertaking: the construction, from the bottom up, of the most complex machine ever designed.
04 June 2021It's happening in the pitThe structure to the left of this image is one of the six temporary supports for the 17-metre-in-diameter poloidal field coil #5 (PF5), which is scheduled for installation in late July/early August. To the right, the side correction coil feeder rests in a temporary position; later, it will be lifted several metres to its final location.
04 June 2021Managing a wide temperature gradientGravity supports create the bridge between the toroidal field coils operating at 4 K (minus 269 °C) and the cryostat base at room temperature (approximate). This makes for a huge temperature gradient that must be smoothly distributed throughout the 2.65-metre-tall, 20-tonne component.
04 June 2021Limited spaceThe ITER Tokamak pit is alive with activity as workers, tools and components compete for limited space. Coordination is paramount.
04 June 2021Thermal insulationThermal insulation between the different components of the ITER Tokamak is paramount. Here, workers prepare one of the 18 "support thermal shield" panels that will be fitted tightly to the massive toroidal field coil gravity supports. Each silver-plated panel measures approximately 1.6 m by 3.3 m and weighs 730 kg.
04 June 2021Coil meets frameThe operation goes smoothly, as the 360-tonne magnet coil is positioned on its support frame.
21 May 202117 metresWhen raised to vertical, the 360-tonne toroidal field coils will stand 17 metres tall.
21 May 2021One to anotherAt the entrance of the Assembly Hall, a "swap" is performed: toroidal field coil #8, from Japan, is transferred from its travel frame (right) to a temporary support frame (left) for storage.
21 May 2021Preparing the transferThe teams meet ahead of the transfer operation, which is carried out by one of the two 750-tonne overhead cranes in the Assembly Hall.
21 May 2021Knocking at the doorToroidal field coil #13 (from Japan) has been unwrapped in the Cleaning Facility. It will be the second coil mounted on the sector sub-assembly tooling, joining vacuum vessel sector #6 and pairing with toroidal field coil #12.
21 May 202127 assembly-phase liftsThe upending tool will enter into action 27 times during ITER assembly (not counting lift tests) in order to upend 18 toroidal field coils and 9 vacuum vessel sectors.
18 May 2021How to create a sector sub-assemblyTwo toroidal field coils as well as panels of thermal shielding must be associated with each vacuum vessel sector before the new unit, call a sector sub-assembly, can be transferred to the Tokamak pit. (In the background, we can see sector #6, from Korea, already in the sector sub-assembly (SSA) tooling.)18 May 2021Upending tool in action againThis time, the upending tool will secure and raise to vertical one of the D-shaped toroidal field coils--TF12 from Japan. Once vertical, the coil will be installed on a giant sector sub-assembly tool in the Assembly Hall, to be paired with the first vacuum vessel sector.
18 May 2021Semi-circular feederOn 15 May 2021, this 10-tonne circular feeder was inserted in the assembly pit. This in-pit component will connect to a cryostat feedthrough in order to deliver electrical power to the six side correction coils located at the mid section of the machine.
15 May 2021Teams prepare ITER games?Arranged unexpectedly in a configuration that can only remind us of the Olympic Games, six pre-compression rings in the ITER Assembly Hall are being prepped for installation.
26 April 20214 mm of toleranceThe rotating mechanism of the dual crane heavy lifting beam (in yellow) is clearly visible in this image of the PF6 coil arriving at the bottom of the assembly pit. The coil is installed to within 4 mm of tolerance.
21 April 2021Nearly therePF6 slowly arrives at its destination. The coil will remain on temporary supports until the vacuum vessel has been assembled and welded; then, it will be anchored to the toroidal field coil superstructure.
21 April 2021First ITER magnet lowered into pitThis 400-tonne component—poloidal field coil #6 (PF6)—is the first superconducting magnet to enter the Tokamak pit. It will rest on temporary supports until the vacuum vessel is assembled and welded; at that point PF6 can be adjusted into its final position.
21 April 202125 metres overheadRing magnet PF6 travels at a cruising altitude of 25 metres. Eight hours are required for the installation operation on 21 April 2021.
21 April 2021Just passing throughOn its way to the assembly pit the poloidal field coil passes vacuum vessel sector #6, safely docked in one of the sector sub-assembly tools.
21 April 2021WeightyOn the screen in red flashes the weight under one of the four crane hooks. The total load was approximately 480 tonnes (330-tonne coil plus rigging).
21 April 2021Last checkThe journey is not complete yet. Operators check the coil's position as it hovers 10 centimetres above the temporary supports.
21 April 2021Lifting offLift-off begins. One day earlier, pre-lift trials had been run to assess the risk of not compensating the slight imbalance in the component's centre of gravity caused by a one-tonne feeder on one side. The slight tilting of the coil did not exceed one degree and remained within tolerance.
21 April 2021Lifting attachmentUsed in January for the installation of the lower cryostat thermal shield (https://www.iter.org/newsline/-/3547), this ring-shaped lifting attachment will serve next for the installation of ring-shaped in-cryostat feeders. For the moment it is stored in the Assembly Hall.
20 April 2021Europe completes poloidal field coil #5On Friday 16 April, the first ITER ring magnet to be manufactured by European Domestic Agency contractors on site—poloidal field coil #5 (PF5)—has been moved into temporary storage to await assembly.
16 April 2021State of play in the pit (mid-April 2021)This diagram identifies the components that are visible on the floor of the Tokamak pit in mid-April 2021. For more information see: https://www.iter.org/newsline/-/3593.
15 April 2021Final positionSeen from below, the component is in its final position, supported from above by a radial beam (soon to be detached from the crane) and from below by a pillar under the lower port stub extension.
06 April 2021From aboveSector #6 is inserted from above into the V-shaped sector sub-assembly tool.
06 April 2021Without a hitchThe upending, transfer and tool installation sequence performed on vacuum vessel sector #6 will be repeated eight other times. The first operation was prepared carefully, and went off without a hitch.
06 April 2021To the end of the buildingOn Tuesday 6 April, sector #6 was removed from the upending tool and carried by overhead crane to the end of the Assembly Hall and sector sub-assembly tool #2. Several bespoke attachments interfaced between the crane and the component.
06 April 2021Transferred to SSAT tool #1The first 440-tonne vacuum vessel sector (#6 from Korea) has been transferred to sector sub-assembly tool (SSAT) #1, closest to the Tokamak pit. Two identical tools stand side by side in the Assembly Hall to double the speed at which vacuum vessel sub-assemblies can be created.
06 April 2021MammothThe double-walled, D-shaped sector is 13.8 metres tall, 6.6 metres deep, and 7.8 metres wide.
06 April 2021A strong base for a heavy taskOn 27 March, the teams installed the bottom cylinder of the in-pit assembly tool. With a central column and radiating beams braced against the pit walls, the in-pit column tool will support all nine sectors of the vacuum vessel as they are welded together.
27 March 2021Hollow, but reinforcedThe central column is hollow (although heavily reinforced with ribbing). Cat ladders and port holes will allow access to different levels of the vacuum vessel during assembly.
27 March 2021VerticalFor the first time of its existence, the 440-tonne component is in a vertical position ... and the observer can truly measure the size of the ITER plasma chamber.
26 March 2021Success!The first "upending" operation is successfully performed on sector #6 on 26 March 2021. The vacuum vessel sector, now vertical, will soon be mounted on specialized tooling in the Assembly Hall.
26 March 2021Mid-airThe tilt operation took place mid-air. At one point, the component was nine metres overhead.
26 March 2021It takes a teamPersonnel from the Dynamic consortium (machine assembly), crane operators from Foselev, security experts from APAVE, and ITER construction team members were all involved in the successful upending operation for sector #6.
26 March 2021Ring magnet PF6 enters Assembly HallPoloidal field coil #6 (PF6) is the second smallest of the ITER ring magnets in terms of diameter (10 metres) but the first in the assembly sequence of the ITER Tokamak. It will be lowered onto temporary supports at the bottom of the Tokamak pit in April.

24 March 2021Coil enters assembly antechamberThis 360 magnet coil—toroidal field coil #12, from Japan—is leaving a temporary storage facility and entering the Cleaning Facility.
22 March 2021Bird's eye viewA bird's eye view of the assembly and installation projects running in parallel in the ITER Assembly Hall. Top right: vacuum vessel sector #6, lashed to its frame, has been positioned in the upending tool; bottom right: pre-compression rings await their turn in the assembly pit; bottom left: the base cylinder of the in-pit assembly tool, ready for lifting; top left: on a red stand, the radial beam that will attach to the top of the vacuum vessel sector once it is lifted to its vertical orientation.
22 March 2021Big lift to comeThe assembly teams are preparing the overhead cranes, and all their interfacing parts, for the next big lift: bringing the first 440-tonne vacuum vessel sector from horizontal to vertical.
22 March 2021Upending operationThis specialized upending frame will be used to raise two types of large components—vacuum vessel sectors (440 tonnes) and toroidal field coils (360 tonnes)—from their horizontal delivery configuration to vertical for subsequent installation on the sector sub-assembly tools. The "tilt" operation is carried out in coordination with the overhead cranes.
21 March 2021First element of the central columnClose to 6 metres tall and weighing approximately 70 tonnes, this is the first segment of the in-pit column tool, the bottom cylinder. Hollow inside, it will permit access to different levels of the vacuum vessel during in-pit welding operations. Four other segments will follow to build the full column.
10 March 2021Concentric circles of supportHalf of the toroidal field magnet supports (covered in yellow) have been installed in the pit. Anchored in a circle to the cryostat base, they will support the outer edge of each toroidal field coil.
10 March 2021Shear keysAt the bottom of the pit, the assembly teams are preparing for the installation of a tall central column, part of the in-pit assembly tool that will support the vacuum vessel during welding. The first segment of the column, the lower cylinder, will be anchored to the concrete basemat through these four shear keys.
10 March 2021Little "bosses"Approximately 700 ''bosses'' have been welded to the outer skin of vacuum vessel sector #6 in precise locations, for the attachment of instrumentation, instrumentation cables, and cable trays. Over the workers' heads are some of the magnetic sensor cases, attached with four ''bosses'' each; elsewhere, we see the routing of cables and instrumention wires.
10 March 2021Prepping the toroidal field coilsA pair of toroidal field coils supplied by Japan is being prepped for pre-assembly. The process adds approximately 10 tonnes of equipment, some of it temporary, to their already considerable mass.
06 March 2021Sort and connectThe ITER Tokamak is an experimental machine whose parameters will be closely monitored by a vast array of diagnostics devices. Sorting and connecting the low-voltage cables that transport data from sensors on the toroidal field coils is a delicate operation that is performed during the assembly prep works.
06 March 2021Preparing for lift offStrong orange lashing lines will help to keep vacuum vessel sector #6 securely attached to its lifting frame during the 90-degree upending procedure.
02 March 2021440 tonnesPlanned for mid-March, the first upending operation will be quite spectacular. Once raised to vertical, this 440-tonne vacuum vessel sector will stand just over 11 metres tall.
02 March 2021Keeping cleanA close-up of the lower cryostat work area. A strict cleanliness protocol is in effect, to keep dust and sub-microscopic particles off of the components.
02 March 2021Pre-compression rings: preparing to install sixMetrology operations are underway on the first of six pre-compression rings to be positioned in the assembly pit at the end of the month. The rings have an inner diameter of 5 metres.
26 February 2021A busy monthMarch will be a busy month in the assembly theatre. In every corner of the vast Assembly Hall, teams are preparing for the upcoming operations (the upending of the first vacuum vessel sector, the installation of part of the in-pit column tool, the installation of the first pre-compression rings...).
26 February 2021Ring gameSeen on the shop floor: six pre-compression rings as well as their lift tool and a seventh test coil.
26 February 2021Filling upThe lower part of the assembly pit is getting more crowded by the day. On the rim of the cryostat base (the "pedestal"), five toroidal gravity supports are now installed. At the bottom level, six temporary supports for poloidal field coil #6 are arranged in a perfect circle. In the middle, drilling is underway to prepare for the bolting of the 600-tonne "central column" on to a massive circular embedded plate.
26 February 2021Inside sector #6Stub keys and flexible support housings dot the inner surface of vacuum vessel sector #6. Flexible support cartridges will lock into these housings and act as bolts securing the blanket modules to the vacuum vessel. This massive component is now ready to be upended and positioned on one of the twin giant sector sub-assembly tools.
26 February 2021Perfect alignmentPerfect alignment between two vacuum vessel thermal shield outboard panels was achieved during recent alignment tests.
26 February 2021Lashed tightlyVacuum vessel sector #6 is tightly lashed to its support frame. It will lifted and placed inside the upending tool on its frame, and then lifted to vertical. © Les Nouveaux Médias/SNC ENGAGE26 February 2021Not so smallThe man in the middle of the image helps us to put the size of the temporary supports for poloidal field coil #6 into perspective. They are quite large ... and strong enough to support 400 tonnes.
23 February 2021Practising a major operationDummy loads have been transferred from the upending tool to one of the sector sub-assembly tools. The assembly contractors are preparing and practicing for the upending of vacuum vessel #6 next month.
18 February 2021Temporary magnet supportsA new circle is being formed by temporary supports being installed for poloidal field coil #6. In April, the 400-tonne magnet will be lowered onto these supports, where it will remain until the completion of vacuum vessel assembly. The wider circle, in pink, is the lower cryostat thermal shield, which was installed in January 2021. See: https://www.iter.org/newsline/-/3547.
15 February 2021Close upA close up of the support units for poloidal field coil #6 that have been bolted to the cryostat base. Each of the nine supports weighs approximately 5 tonnes and contains vertical actuators.
13 February 2021Group visitA group of senior managers makes a tour of the pre-assembly activities underway in the Assembly Hall.
12 February 2021SSAT tool #2 in actionThermal shield fitting tests are being carried out on sector sub-assembly tool (SSAT) #2. The outboard panels of vacuum vessel thermal shielding were first mounted on the wings of the tool; then, the wings rotated slowly inward to test the alignment of the panels. Metrology is underway.
12 February 2021Before rotationThe outboard thermal shield sectors have been mounted on the tools and a last metrology session is underway before the components rotated inward.
11 February 2021PF6 enters an ITER storage facilityThe coil was transferred from the European coil winding facility on site to an ITER storage facility to be prepared for assembly.
27 January 2021First poloidal field coil handed overOn 27 January 2021, the first of six poloidal field coils is handed over to the ITER Organization by the European Domestic Agency, Fusion for Energy. Poloidal field coil #6 (PF6) is a 400-tonne magnet that will be the first to be assembled into the ITER machine pit.
27 January 2021Out in the galleriesThe coil terminal box is the part of the magnet feeder that sits farthest from the machine core. Nine metres in length, shaped like a shipping container, the box houses warm-to-cold electrical transition equipment, remote control helium supply valves, and sensors for coil instrumentation.
26 January 2021Roll it inThis backend feeder component has been lowered to B2 basement level in the Tritium Building and will now move on rollers to its final position.
26 January 2021Heading inThe load is seen here as it approaches an opening on the Tritium Building side of the Tokamak Building. Twenty-one feeders will be situated at the bottom of the machine, and another 10 at the top.
26 January 2021Magnet feeder segment installed in Tritium BuildingOn 26 January 2021, the coil terminal box serving toroidal field coils #12 and #13 is lifted and moved inside the basement of the Tokamak Building. Each magnet feeder comprises three elements: a coil terminal box, a cryostat feedthrough (segment passing through the bioshield and cryostat) and an in-cryostat feeder (segment connecting to the magnets). See more at: https://www.iter.org/newsline/-/356426 January 2021Like a gloveThe lower cryostat thermal shield, partially draped in pink cloth, fits the depression of the cryostat base like a glove.
20 January 2021Another shiny elementAnother element of thermal shielding—this time the inboard shielding element for vacuum vessel sector #6—is being prepped in a laydown area in the Assembly Hall.
20 January 2021IntricateDelicate cooling pipes snake along the outer surface of the inboard sector of vacuum vessel thermal shielding.
20 January 2021Gravity supports: first unitThe first toroidal field coil gravity support is installed on the pedestal of the cryostat base. It stands 2.65 metres tall.
15 January 2021Well doneAs the load is transferred from the crane to an array of hydraulic jacks, a full-day operation comes to an end. A few more adjustments ... then final metrology ... and the day can be declared a success.
14 January 2021Corrected!After a bit of rope pulling to realign the load, the final descent can begin. The temporary rails (in grey against the silvery backdrop of the component) are now ready to slide into the tower-like alignment tools all the way to the bottom of the pit. The protruding bolts of the gravity support (left) were passed without incident.
14 January 2021Realignment neededThe lower cryostat thermal shield is now well engaged in the assembly pit. A slight rotation has been identified and re-alignment will be necessary before the component engages its final descent.
14 January 2021Ready for loweringThe component has travelled the length of the assembly theatre and is now positioned right above the pit. Two alignment tools, visible at the bottom of the large circular opening, will guide its final trajectory.
14 January 2021CloseThe component's trajectory brings it to within a few metres of the vacuum vessel sector assembly tools (at left). A team member is stationed at the top of one tool to keep a watchful eye.
14 January 2021Travelling 100 metresThe 50-tonne lower cryostat thermal shield travelled approximately 100 metres to the Tokamak pit at a cruising altitude of 23 metres.
14 January 2021Attached to a "strong back"Attached to its ''strong back,'' the 50-tonne lower cryostat thermal shield has reached cruising speed (2 metres/minute). Its silvery surface reflects the colours, lights and distorted shapes of the environment.
14 January 2021Up it goesA few minutes after take-off, the component has reached its cruising altitude of 23 metres and is now aligned with its destination—the mouth of the assembly pit at the opposite end of the assembly theatre.
14 January 2021One hook, 18 attachment interfacesAttached to the overhead crane by a single hook, the "strong back" is connected to the thin component (10 millimetres) by way of 18 attachment interfaces equally distributed around its circumference. This type of rigging is designed to provide both rigidity and stability.
14 January 2021New testsA new series of tests is underway on the upending tool.
13 January 2021Tall gravity supports: in line for installationEighteen of these toroidal field coil gravity supports must be positioned on the cryostat base. This one is about to be transferred into the Tokamak pit.
12 January 2021PracticingBy overhead crane, the teams are transferring two dummy loads (representing approximately 700 tonnes) to the tool in its upright position, practicing for when the upending tool will handle some of ITER's heaviest components: toroidal field coils or vacuum vessel sectors.
11 January 2021Two segments of the thermal shield are mountedWith two outboard thermal shield panels now mounted on one of the giant pre-assembly tools, thermal shield assembly trials can begin.
08 January 2021One for the road ...

12 December 2020Advancing carefullyThe Larsen & Toubro/MAN Energy Solution teams continue to weld the cryostat base and lower cylinder together in the Tokamak pit. It is a precise and careful job, which is carried out by highly qualified technicians.
12 December 2020Cooling manifold installationOn the inner surface of the lower cryostat thermal shield, workers have begun installing cooling manifold pipes.
07 December 2020Radial beamsOne of the nine radial beams that will support the vacuum vessel sectors are they are loaded onto the assembly tooling, and support the full vacuum vessel assemblies as they are transferred and installed in the pit.
04 December 2020First component upendedA panel of outboard thermal shield for vacuum vessel sector #6 has been installed on one of the sector sub-assembly tools. For the giant tool, it represented the first ''embrace'' of an actual machine component.
25 November 2020Lift frame goes alongA specially designed frame accompanied the thermal shield panel during the lift. Both thermal shield and lifting frames are supplied to the ITER Project by Korea.
25 November 2020A protective "shell"The vacuum vessel thermal shield is like a shell that encloses the vacuum vessel and protects the magnetic system from thermal radiation. At the pre-assembly stage, each vacuum vessel sector will be fitted with the three panels of thermal shield: two outboard (left and right) and one inboard.
25 November 2020Seen from the topThis picture is taken from the top of the tool, as the thermal shield panel and its structure are "docked."25 November 2020By zoneFrom above, we have a clear view of the different work zones of the Assembly Hall. The component the furthest from the Tokamak pit (the lower cylinder thermal shield, top) will be the next one installed.
23 November 2020Inside and outsideAll kinds of activity is underway to prepare the first vacuum vessel sector for pre-assembly.
23 November 2020Up in the raftersTaken from a height of approximately 55 metres, this photo captures the crane hall of the Tokamak Building and the deep machine assembly well.
23 November 2020Fearless photographerThe ITER photographer climbed the equivalent of 20 stories to get this comprehensive shot of pre-assembly activities underway.
23 November 2020Chunky accessoriesA huge crane requires huge accessories. These are some of the attachments of the ITER bridge cranes.
17 November 2020Lying in waitThe two toroidal field coils received from Japan will be needed next year in the first vacuum vessel sub-assembly to be mounted on the giant standing tools in the Assembly Hall. Until then there is plenty to do: leak testing the welds in the helium piping and adding handling and pre-assembly equipment.
17 November 2020720 tonnesTwo 360-tonne dummy loads have now been loaded onto the upending tool for trials that are preparing for the first component lifts.
13 November 2020Tall supportsSome of the gravity supports for the toroidal field coils are stored in the Assembly Hall. They will be installed one by one on the pedestal of the cryostat base.
13 November 2020How to liftThese lifting lugs were pre-installed on toroidal field coil #12. For now, the coil is in a preparatory area not far from the Assembly Hall.
11 November 2020Like a candleIn this photo, the metrology tower in the centre of the pit looks a lot like a candle. Perhaps for ITER's 10 years of construction? (Building works on the platform began in August 2010.)09 November 2020Practicing every stepBehind vacuum vessel sector #6, operators are practicing the lift operation that will bring the sector from horizontal to vertical. The crane is about to raise the upending frame (seen here loaded with dummy weights).
09 November 2020Pre-compression ringsTwo sets of pre-compression rings and dedicated lifting equipment are stored on site. The bottom set will be called for installation quite early in the machine assembly process.
03 November 2020Step by stepA pass inside the six-metre-long predefined sections is approximately one millimetre thick ... and it takes close to 80 passes to fill the gap between the two components. Behind the wall, a specialist monitors the process by video screen.
30 October 2020Advancing cautiouslyThe progress of the welding machine (8 centimetres per minute) is closely scrutinized by a technician from MAN Energy Solutions (contractor to Larsen & Toubro, the cryostat manufacturer).
30 October 2020First in-pit weldingThe gap between the cryostat lower cylinder and the cryostat base is 40 millimetres. It will take 1 tonne of filler material to completely weld the 90 metres of circumference.
30 October 2020Heat barrierThis lower cryostat thermal shield will be positioned inside of the soup-dish-shaped depression of the cryostat base to form a heat barrier.
30 October 2020Lower cryostat thermal shieldIn the ITER Assembly Hall, contractors are joining eighteen 20° segments of thermal shield into a silver circle.
30 October 2020Barnacles?Like barnacles colonizing a whale, small cylindrical "bosses" are being welded in precise locations to the outer shell of vacuum vessel sector #6. Bosses are like studs onto which other components can be bolted or welded, for example instrumentation and diagnostics cables.
22 October 2020Bumps galoreThe larger cylinders, bordered with white, are metrology targets. The smaller "bosses" are like clips that will hold instrumentation and diagnostics cables.
22 October 2020Using "laser templating" for the first timeImplemented in ITER for the first time, "laser templating" techniques are used to project an outline of the element to be welded at its precise pre-defined position on the component's surface with a safe, low-power laser, providing the welder with a perfect template to follow. (Read more about that here: https://www.iter.org/newsline/-/3359.)22 October 2020How it will lookThis mockup clearly illustrates the attachment role played by the "bosses": the small rectangular frame will support a sensor; the flat hold plates are for cable looms; and another set of smaller devices provides a pathway to the "continuous flux loop," a single cable that runs along the whole circumference of the torus to measure the magnetic field.
22 October 2020Outside and insideApproximately 800 "bosses" need to be welded to the outer surface of each vacuum vessel sector. As for those planned on the component's inner wall, they will be installed once the vacuum vessel pre-assemblies have been lowered into the Tokamak pit.
22 October 2020Horizontal for nowVacuum vessel sector #6 is on a platform across from the large assembly tool where it will be mounted (in a vertical position) during the first sector sub-assembly operation.
22 October 2020Thermal shield(s)Seen from above, elements of the vacuum vessel thermal shield (foreground, centre) and the lower cryostat thermal shield (foreground right, and background). To the left, a lifting frame that will support vacuum vessel thermal shield sectors as they are lifted to vertical and installed on the large pre-assembly tools.
15 October 2020The shineThe component's shine is due to the thin layer of silver that covers its entire surface. A "low emissivity" material, silver raises an obstacle against the thermal radiation, in the form of electromagnetic waves, that a heat source generates.
15 October 2020Thermal shield uncoveredLike a giant's tiara. This segment of silver-coated thermal shield will on the outside of the D-shaped vacuum vessel sector #6.

15 October 2020Lower cryostat thermal shieldSilver-plated thermal shield panels are being arranged in a circle to form the lower section of the cryostat thermal shield, which should be lowered into the assembly pit in late November.
15 October 2020Readying an assembly toolThis sector lifting tool will be positioned between the heaviest components to be lifted into the giant sector pre-assembly tools in the Assembly Hall and the hooks of the overhead cranes. A control system can be activated through controllers and electrically driven actuators to optimally balance the loads.
15 October 2020Two types of thermal shieldPanels of cryostat thermal shielding have arrived at the Assembly Hall from Korea, alongside larger sections of vacuum vessel thermal shielding.
14 October 2020Close inspectionThis outboard panel of thermal shielding is undergoing careful inspection.

07 October 2020A big jobIt will take several months to weld the cryostat upper cylinder to the cryostat base. Work started in October.
07 October 2020Tool in testingSoon, three types of components will be lifted into the first Sector Sub-Assembly tools in the Assembly Hall: a vacuum vessel sector, a pair of toroidal field coils, and inboard and outboard thermal shield panels. This tool, in testing now, will lift and "upend" the inboard thermal shield panel.
01 October 2020A smaller upending toolOne massive upending tool (background, lying flat) will raise ITER's vacuum vessel sectors and toroidal field coils to vertical; two others will do the same for the lighter inner and outboard sectors of vacuum vessel thermal shielding. This outboard sector upending tool has just been detached from the giant SSAT tools where it was tested.
29 September 2020Metrology on vacuum vessel #6The first vacuum vessel sector has passed all site acceptance tests and is now being measured from every angle by the metrology teams. (Look closely to see the metrology targets.)28 September 2020Gravity supports for the toroidal field coilsEighteen of these 2.65-metre-tall gravity supports will be bolted to the cryostat base to support the outer edge of the toroidal field coils. The full gravity load of the ITER magnets (10,000 tonnes) will be transferred to the cryostat through these marvels of engineering delivered by China. They are next in line for delivery to the Tokamak pit.
24 September 2020A new workshopThis new workshop will be operated by the DYNAMIC consortium, which was formed to execute one of ITER's two main machine assembly contracts, TAC2 (Tokamak Assembly Contract 2). The workshop will be a space for repairs and retrofitting, and boasts two milling machines, a large CNC (Computer Numeric Control) machine, and spaces for welding and metrology.
22 September 2020On the base pedestalThe cryostat lower cylinder is still on hydraulic jacks as final alignment activities are carried out and the first tack welds are performed.
17 September 2020Shrek?With the distortions of a fisheye lens, this vacuum vessel sector reminds us of Shrek—the (all-green) cartoon character with ears that look a lot like these port extensions.
17 September 2020Magnet feeder elements arrivingThis giant semi-circular component is destined for installation under the machine. It is part of a magnet feeder—the components that deliver cryogens and electrical power to the superconducting magnets.
10 September 2020That's 1,600 tonnes of steelThe two major Tokamak components already installed in the pit—the cryostat base and lower cylinder—represent 1,600 tonnes of steel. Welding operations to join the two pieces begin this week.
09 September 2020Joining two components in the pitThe assembly teams in the Tokamak pit are preparing for the root welding of the cryostat lower cylinder to the pedestal of the cryostat base. Mechanical cleaning of the bevel has been completed; next, the cylinder will be locked to the base through bridge piece welding and the alignment tool will be removed.
09 September 2020Warming upThis large tool—the "upending tool"—will lift some of ITER's heaviest components to vertical so that they can be installed in the vacuum vessel sub-assembly tools (left). Warm-up tests are underway.
09 September 2020ConcentratingContractors prepare the metrics for another round of upending tool lift tests. © Les Nouveaux Médias/SNC ENGAGE04 September 2020Sector #6 is leak tightThe first ITER vacuum vessel sector has passed a helium leak test on site with flying colours, confirmed to be leak tight to two orders of magnitude better than acceptance criteria.
02 September 2020Final positionThe lower cylinder was first docked on an alignment device on 31 August; on 2 September the final alignment was performed within the required tolerances. The Indian Domestic Agency and its contractor MAN Energy Solutions will begin welding the cryostat lower cylinder to the cryostat base on 7 September.
31 August 2020Home at lastAnd finally, the cryostat lower cylinder hovers just a few centimetres above the cryostat base. Teams will carry out some final measurements before settling it onto temporary supports.
31 August 2020Exacting tolerancesNot only does the component have to clear the tight tolerances that separate it from the walls as it descends, but its many openings (called penetrations) have to line up precisely with corresponding openings in the bioshield.
31 August 2020Up and overThe massive component spent more than four hours suspended from the overhead cranes as it was lifted, transferred across the Assembly Hall, and lowered. Here, it clears the tallest assembly tools by just a few inches.
31 August 2020Lower cylinder is aloftThis 375-tonne steel cylinder is the second section of the cryostat to be installed in the Tokamak pit. The operation, which was carried out on 31 August, went off without a hitch.
31 August 2020Full shopThe lower cylinder is just passing through. After approximately one week of preparation, metrology measurements, and trial lift tests, the 10-metre-tall lower cylinder will be lifted up and over the crowded shop floor of the Assembly Hall and lowered into the Tokamak pit.
22 August 2020Plenty of spaceJust in time, the vacuum vessel sector that had recently been delivered from Korea was moved to the other side of the building, and its travel platform and casing were removed.
22 August 2020Into the airlockThe component first enters the Cleaning Facility, and the doors are shut behind it, before the rolling doors of the Assembly Hall are pulled back.
22 August 2020Cryostat lower cylinder: next up in lineThe lightly wrapped cryostat lower cylinder—30 metres in diameter, 375 tonnes—is seen through the open doors of the Cryostat Workshop, right before its transfer into the Assembly Hall.
22 August 2020Making roomThe component is now directly across from the sector sub-assembly tools (SSATs), where it will be pre-assembled with a pair of D-shaped magnet coils and thermal shield panels.
20 August 2020Transfer successfulOn Friday 20 August, 490 tonnes (sector plus frame) were successfully lifted, transferred 40 metres, and redeposited on supports on the other side of the Assembly Hall.
20 August 2020LeapfrogThe teams in the Assembly Hall are organizing the transfer of vacuum vessel sector #6 to a location on the other side of the building, across from the sector pre-assembly tools. Room must be made for the next large component expected to enter through the large double doors—the cryostat lower cylinder.
20 August 2020First of nineEach vacuum vessel sector will be paired with two toroidal field coils and thermal shielding on the giant sector sub-assembly tools in the Assembly Hall. Sector #6 (pictured) will be the first to undergo this suite of assembly operations; sector #7, also from Korea, will be the next. Today, S#7 is 94% complete at Hyundai Heavy Industries.
12 August 2020Then the otherThis 440-tonne steel component travelled 10,000 km to reach ITER after it was finalized at Hyundai Heavy Industries in Korea.

27 May 2020A tight fitA tight fit At the mouth of the pit, the distance from the rim of the cryostat base to the wall is approximately 50 centimetres. It gets smaller as the component descends into the depths of the concrete cylinder, reducing to only 5 centimetres at the level of the crown.
26 May 2020Watching as it passesStanding in one of the bioshield's portholes, a technician from the CNPE consortium watches in awe as the cryostat base almost brushes the inner walls of the pit.
26 May 2020A bit of low techHowever sophisticated the technologies involved, there comes a moment when ancient tooling and methods come in handy. Here, a plumb bob attached to the component gives a clear visual indication of verticality.
26 May 2020First major machine componentThis first machine component was procured by the Indian Domestic Agency through the industrial giant Larsen & Toubro. Steel segments fabricated in India were assembled on site in the Cryostat Workshop by teams from Larsen & Toubro and MAN Energy Solutions (welding).
26 May 2020Perfect fitThe 1,250-tonne machine base has just the room it needs to enter the Tokamak pit.
26 May 2020Major machine assembly milestoneOn Tuesday 26 May, the first major machine component—the cryostat base—is lifted by overhead crane and lowered into the Tokamak assembly pit.
26 May 2020OverheadThe cryostat base travelled up and over the equipment in the Assembly Hall and into the Tokamak Building—a voyage of approximately 150 metres.

20 May 2020Penultimate testEvery aspect of the lift operation has been choreographed and practiced in advance of the big day. In one critical test on 20 May, the cryostat base is lifted six metres and then set back onto its supports.
20 May 2020Match exactlyThe pedestal of the cryostat base will be affixed to the female lugs seen here in the wall of the bioshield (steel rectangles). To meet these interfacing pieces, the base must be positioned as it is lowered with a tolerance of +/-5 mm.
13 May 202018 cryostat bearingsA set of 18 spherical bearings, evenly spaced and deeply anchored into the "crown," will bear the full weight of the machine and, acting as ball-and-socket joints, will enable the smooth transfer of horizontal and rotational forces.

25 April 2020Cryostat base enters buildingCryostat base enters building Installation contractors have moved the cryostat base from its fabrication workshop on site into the Assembly Hall. (The big lift to the Tokamak Building will take place next month.) The Indian Domestic Agency has delivered the completed component in collaboration with main contractor Larsen & Toubro Heavy Engineering (manufacturing design, segment fabrication in India and assembly at ITER) and MAN Energy Solutions, Germany (Larsen & Toubro sub-contractor for on-site welding).

The 360-tonne component is one of ten toroidal field magnets to be delivered by Europe. (Japan will deliver another nine.)17 April 2020Getting readyThe Tokamak pit is nearly ready for its first machine component: 18 cryostat bearings are in place on the cryostat crown, contractors are finalizing painting and cleaning, and captive components have been installed in areas that will be blocked once the cryostat base has been lowered.
02 April 2020The lid is offStanding at the end of the Tokamak Building, looking over the Tokamak pit toward the Assembly Hall. The temporary lid has been removed and installation activities are about to start.
02 April 2020Removing the temporay lidThe temporary lid over the assembly pit is made of 11 segments ranging in weight from 10 to over 80 tonnes. They have to be removed, one by one, to make way for machine assembly.
02 April 2020Pit revealedAs the last segment of the lid is raised, we have access to a spectacular view of the 30-metre-deep assembly pit.
02 April 2020Testing the path before the real loadsTotaling approximately 1,000 tonnes, the mock loads are ready to undertake their 170-metre-long journey from the entrance of the Assembly Hall all the way to the opposite end of the newly created crane hall. Testing the load path, and carefully monitoring building inflection as the loads go by, are part of the last commissioning activities before machine assembly.
28 March 2020Preparing for episode oneAs the European Domestic Agency puts the finishing touches on work in the Tokamak pit (painting, cleaning), ITER's Construction Management-as-Agent contractor MOMENTUM is preparing for the first episode of machine assembly: the lowering of the cryostat base.
26 March 2020Getting readyAt the bottom of the Tokamak pit, teams are preparing for the arrival of the cryostat base.
26 March 2020Open for assemblyThere is no longer a barrier separating the Assembly Hall from the Tokamak Building. In the next step, the temporary lid over the machine assembly pit will be dismantled and removed.
26 March 2020Team spiritUnder the supervision of the ITER Organization, upending tool testing was coordinated by MOMENTUM (ITER's Construction Management-as-Agent). It involved Apave (security), contractors from the assembly consortium DYNAMIC, an operator, and an engineer from crane manufacturer REEL.
25 February 2020Pre-assembly preparationsThe upending tool is lifted off the floor so that metrologists can measure the planarity of its support pads.
24 February 2020Dancers in a vertical balletAcrobatic workers are busy disassembling the temporary wall that separates the Assembly Hall from the Tokamak Building.
19 February 2020Up in the raftersSoon, these bridge cranes will be able to travel double distance—not only the length of the Assembly Hall, but that of the adjacent building as well. Crane commissioning activities over the Tokamak pit will start once the temporary wall comes down.
18 February 2020Back in serviceTwo 360-tonne test loads are back on the main tools of the Assembly Hall. With extra weight added, they will be used to commission the overhead cranes in the new crane hall of the Tokamak Building. The temporary wall between the buildings is coming down now.
14 February 2020Next to test: the upending toolTool commissioning is an important activity, during which the all specified functional requirements are demonstrated. Also, for tools sourced outside of the European Union, it is the occasion to show compliance with EU regulations.
13 December 2019Load tests conclusiveThe commissioning phase for the twin sector sub-assembly tools (SSAT) in the Assembly Hall is over. The final verification tests—with test load (photo)—demonstrated that both tools are performing to expectation.
27 November 2019Upending tool arrivesThe two halves of the upending tool (right) are headed for installation in the far right corner of the Assembly Hall, on the area of floor that has been painted.
14 November 2019The doors open and ...
... the segments of the upending tool, delivered by Korea, enter. This large structure is designed to "upend" ITER's largest components (toroidal field coils and vacuum vessel sectors) from horizontal to vertical.
07 November 2019Shift of weightIn late September, the second 360-tonne load (at left) was transferred to SSAT tool #2 (on the right). After one month of functional tests on the second tool, the loads will be removed and stored until needed for the testing of the "upending" structure that has been shipped by Korea. (See more on that tool here: https://www.iter.org/newsline/-/3112)30 September 2019First cryostat bearingFirst cryostat bearing Eighteen semi-spherical bearings anchored deep in the Tokamak support crown will act like ball-and-socket joints under the pedestal of the cryostat to allow the smooth transfer of forces generated during machine operation. The first one has been installed.
04 September 2019Rotated completelyThe wings of the first sector sub-assembly tool (SSAT1) have been fully rotated inward and the tool has performed as expected. Later this month, the mock loads will be transferred to SSAT2. Both tools will enter service in 2020.
04 September 2019Two mountedTwo mock loads were built in Scotland by Doosan Babcock and shipped to ITER for assembly. They represent a combined weight of 700 tonnes, now mounted on the tool SSAT#1. Rotational tests begin late in July.
23 July 2019A little push by hand ...
Even in the most technical of operations, there is always a need for final adjustment by hand. Seen vertically, the loads share the D-shape of the toroidal field coils they are meant to represent. They also reproduce the centre of gravity and mass distribution of the coils.
22 July 2019Coming inAt the bottom of the Tokamak pit, different openings allow for the arrival of electricity, cryogens and instrumentation. In the picture, placeholders have been pre-positioned. © Les Nouveaux Médias/SNC ENGAGE12 July 2019The pit, all aglowRaw concrete in the Tokamak assembly pit has given way to the smooth shiny surface of white paint. Teams have been working to complete the job in this 25,000 cubic-metre space since early March; now only finishing touches remain to prepare for machine assembly.
03 July 2019Lower galleriesThis opening in the 3.5-metre-thick bioshield was specially designed to house the part of the feeder that crosses through the bioshield and cryostat—the feedthrough. Thirty-one feeders in all will find their way through galleries like this to reach the ITER magnets.
06 December 2018"As installed"At the bottom of the machine assembly pit, the first metal component has been inserted into its bay. Metrologists are recording its "as-installed" position, as this component will be assembled with two other sub-assemblies to form the full magnet feeder for poloidal field coil #4. Thirty-one feeders in all will deliver electricity, cryogens and instruments to the ITER magnets.
06 December 2018Installed!Into the slim opening of the cryostat crown: a break in the concrete had been left by building contractors for the installation of the cryostat feedthrough for poloidal field coil #4. The operation was successfully carried out on 6 December 2018.
06 December 2018LifelinesFeeders will reach the magnets by either crossing through the lower level of the bioshield—passing under the machine—or through the top level, passing over.
27 November 2018First of manyThe feeder array for the ITER magnets is composed of over 100 main components. This one was scheduled for delivery ahead of the others because of its particular shape and its installation configuration at the lower level of the Tokamak Pit.
26 November 2018Through the openingThrough the opening The magnet feeder component passes through one of the openings of the temporary bioshield lid. This lid will remain in place until the Tokamak Building roof is completed.
26 November 2018The first oneThe cryostat feedthrough begins its 30-metre descent—the first metal component of the ITER machine to enter this space.
26 November 2018Up it goesThe 10-metre, 6.6-tonne component (part of a magnet feeder for poloidal field coil #4) is slowly lifted up and over the wall of the Tokamak Complex, to be posed near the top of the ITER bioshield. From there, it will be lowered into the pit.
26 November 2018Tests completedThe first metallic component to be installed in the machine pit—a feeder component—had been delivered by China for testing to the Magnet Infrastructure Facilities for ITER (MIFI), next door on the CEA site, one year ago. On 26 November 2018, it was positioned outside of the Tokamak Complex for lifting.

It will be slid into place through this break in the crown. © Les Nouveaux Médias/SNC ENGAGE05 September 2018Diagnostic cablesThe plasma inside the vacuum vessel is monitored in real-time by a vast array of magnetic sensors, thermocouples and accelerometers. Data, vital for machine operation, is transmitted by cables of the type that is seen here in a temporary "bundle." Once the vacuum vessel is in place inside the pit, the cables will be pulled through trays across the cryostat feedthroughs and connected to the corresponding diagnostic systems.

Dimensional control will be critical to ensuring that tolerances are respected, and to recording the "as-built" status of the machine, which will be directly compared against ITER's Computer-Aided-Design (CAD) models in order to correct eventual deviations in alignment before they accumulate. Positional tolerances for the largest components, including the magnet coils and the vacuum vessel, are as low as 2 mm.

The welding tools will have to manoeuvre the complex geometry of the sectors and ports and reach areas that are not directly accessible to operators and where visibility is restricted. The robots will also be confined to welding from inside the vessel and ports, as the pre-installed vacuum vessel thermal shield makes access to the exterior surfaces impossible. Extensive trials on mockups have been performed to quantify and plan for shrinkage, and to qualify tools, processes, and inspection techniques.

To ensure correct machine performance, all connections associated with ultra-high vacuum or high vacuum components must be 100 percent leak-tight. Vacuum lines, helium lines, pipes, valves, seals, joints, and/or flanges have all gone through pre-qualification, while some of the largest vacuum components—for example, the seals manufactured for the vacuum vessel's 50+ large ports—are being tested on dedicated test rigs. During in-pit assembly, only qualified welding procedures, carried out by certified professionals, will be employed, and the quality of all vacuum-related welds will be verified by surface and volumetric non-destructive examination. Full-scale leak testing is planned during the 12-month integrated commissioning period before First Plasma, during which the large vacuum chambers—the vacuum vessel and the cryostat—will be evacuated and leak tested. In parallel, the ITER Organization is developing a set of specialized tools and technologies for the localization and detection of leaks smaller than the width of hair divided by one million.

All activities related to a safety-important or protection-important component or system (for example ITER's first confinement barrier, the vacuum vessel) must be performed correctly and documented as verified through regular surveillance and inspection.
