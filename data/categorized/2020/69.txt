AboutMachineScienceConstructionAssemblyNews & MediaTopAssembly underwayNow that ITER assembly has started, a clean corridor is the obligatory passageway into the ITER Assembly Hall leading to a check-in desk and worker changing rooms. Follow all assembly activity on the ITER website at ASSEMBLY (https://www.iter.org/construction/assembly).
10 September 2020Lower cylinderA new machine component is making a short pause in the Assembly Hall before it is inserted into the machine well: the cryostat lower cylinder. Ten metres tall, 30 metres in diameter, and 375 tonnes.
22 August 2020Next piece comingFrom the rafters, a view of the machine assembly theatre. The first machine component, the cryostat base, has already been installed. The cryostat lower cylinder will be transferred into the Tokamak pit in early September.
20 August 2020Latest arrivalThe first vacuum vessel sector from Korea has been delivered to a laydown area in the Assembly Hall. After a final helium leak test and site acceptance test, the component will be ready for handover to the ITER Organization assembly contractor responsible for the vessel (TAC2) for a number of initial activities such as the installation of diagnostics, instrumentation and cable trays.
11 August 2020Thermal shield lift frame: tests underwayIn the ITER Assembly Hall, another pair of assembly tools designed and procured by Korea—the thermal shield frames—are undergoing tests without load. These frames will support tall panels of thermal shielding as they are lifted to vertical for installation of the sector sub-assembly tools.
22 July 2020Preparing for a kickoff eventPreparations are underway in the Assembly Hall for ITER's kickoff assembly event on 28 July 2020. French President Emmanuel Macron and government leaders from China, Europe, India, Japan, Korea, Russia and the United States will join. Tune into the livestream by clicking on the video screen at the end of the announcement (https://www.iter.org/newsline/-/3473).
22 July 2020Understanding the use of spaceA lot is happening in the Assembly Hall. This photo explains it all.
15 June 2020Major machine assembly milestoneOn Tuesday 26 May, the first major machine component—the cryostat base—is lifted by overhead crane and lowered into the Tokamak assembly pit.
26 May 2020Penultimate testEvery aspect of the lift operation has been choreographed and practiced in advance of the big day. In one critical test on 20 May, the cryostat base is lifted six metres and then set back onto its supports.
20 May 2020The base of the machineTwo weeks remain before the first "big lift" of ITER assembly. Preparatory works are underway to prepare the component for handling and the Tokamak pit for receiving.
04 May 2020Cryostat base enters buildingInstallation contractors have moved the cryostat base from its fabrication workshop on site into the Assembly Hall. (The big lift to the Tokamak Building will take place next month.) The Indian Domestic Agency has delivered the completed component in collaboration with main contractor Larsen & Toubro Heavy Engineering (manufacturing design, segment fabrication in India and assembly at ITER) and MAN Energy Solutions, Germany (Larsen & Toubro sub-contractor for on-site welding).
17 April 2020First machine component enters buildingThe cryostat base enters the Cleaning Facility on a self-propelled modular transporter that has 192 wheels. Photo: ITER Organization/EJF Riche17 April 2020Practicing with the upending toolThe upending tool is brought to vertical by the overhead cranes during commissioning tests in the Assembly Hall.
10 April 2020Off to storageIf you look closely at the image, you will see one element of the temporary lid as it is carried over the upending tool to a waiting flatbed truck. The lid will be stored on site for reuse later in the assembly phase.
02 April 2020Heaviest pieceA half-moon element of the temporary lid is transported through the Assembly Hall to the waiting truck.
02 April 2020Two handsThe two 750-tonne overhead cranes take part in the transport of the heaviest elements of the lid, from the Tokamak pit to the waiting truck.
02 April 2020Essential activities on the worksiteActivity continues on the ITER worksite for a list of "essential activities" related to buildings and components, with the strict application of social distancing and recommended sanitary measures. For those used to working in the offices of the ITER Organization, however, approximately 95% are currently working from home.
02 April 2020Testing the path before the real loadsTotaling approximately 1,000 tonnes, the mock loads are ready to undertake their 170-metre-long journey from the entrance of the Assembly Hall all the way to the opposite end of the newly created crane hall. Testing the load path, and carefully monitoring building inflection as the loads go by, are part of the last commissioning activities before machine assembly.
28 March 2020A big beam for a heavy loadThe double overhead bridge crane comprises four such 47-metre-long, 155-tonne steel girders, or beams. Arranged in two pairs and working in tandem, they can lift up to 1,500 tonnes. The double overhead bridge crane was tested at 125 percent of its capacity (1,870 tonnes) in December 2017.
28 March 20201,000 tonnesThe 840-tonne double load on the "north bridge" (right) is complemented by a 156-tonne load on the "south bridge," bringing the total to a little more than 1,000 tonnes. Calculations and modelling are used to extrapolate the effect the actual 1,500-tonne loads will have on the building's structure.
28 March 2020A very clean Cleaning FacilityThe antechamber to the Assembly Hall—the Cleaning Facility—has been prepped and painted in time to receive the first ITER magnets.
06 March 20205-degree incrementsDuring tool commissioning activities, the steel cradle is lifted by increments of 5 degrees. A photogrammetric survey is performed between lifts in order to acquire baseline measurements and to monitor deformations.
28 February 2020Getting ready for machine assemblyTwo important activities in relation to the start of machine assembly are underway: commissioning of the upending tool (pictured) and the commissioning of the heavy lift cranes in the Tokamak Building where the crane rails have been extended over the Tokamak pit.
28 February 2020From horizontal to verticalThe largest ITER machine components (the D-shaped toroidal field coils and the vacuum vessel sectors) will be delivered in a horizontal position. They will be "upended" by the tool at right, before being installed on the SSAT pre-assembly tools at left.
28 February 2020Four pinsThe massive tool nears its resting position on the ground, and four 80-kilogram steel pins (left) are being readied for insertion at the four corners of the tool's base. Pins provide extra security in case of a seismic event.
28 February 2020Team spiritUnder the supervision of the ITER Organization, upending tool testing was coordinated by MOMENTUM (ITER's Construction Management-as-Agent). It involved Apave (security), contractors from the assembly consortium DYNAMIC, an operator, and an engineer from crane manufacturer REEL.
25 February 2020Pre-assembly preparationsThe upending tool is lifted off the floor so that metrologists can measure the planarity of its support pads.
24 February 2020Dancers in a vertical balletAcrobatic workers are busy disassembling the temporary wall that separates the Assembly Hall from the Tokamak Building.
19 February 2020Up in the raftersSoon, these bridge cranes will be able to travel double distance—not only the length of the Assembly Hall, but that of the adjacent building as well. Crane commissioning activities over the Tokamak pit will start once the temporary wall comes down.
18 February 2020Back in serviceTwo 360-tonne test loads are back on the main tools of the Assembly Hall. With extra weight added, they will be used to commission the overhead cranes in the new crane hall of the Tokamak Building. The temporary wall between the buildings is coming down now.
14 February 2020Next to test: the upending toolTool commissioning is an important activity, during which the all specified functional requirements are demonstrated. Also, for tools sourced outside of the European Union, it is the occasion to show compliance with EU regulations.
13 December 2019Commissioning with load completedThe 360-tonne test load is lowered to the Assembly Hall floor. After six months hooked up first to one, then the other, of the sector sub-assembly tools (left), the test loads will be stored in laydown areas until called for use to commission the upending tool.
13 December 2019Load tests conclusiveThe commissioning phase for the twin sector sub-assembly tools (SSAT) in the Assembly Hall is over. The final verification tests—with test load (photo)—demonstrated that both tools are performing to expectation.
27 November 2019Upending tool arrivesThe two halves of the upending tool (right) are headed for installation in the far right corner of the Assembly Hall, on the area of floor that has been painted.
14 November 2019The doors open and ...
... the segments of the upending tool, delivered by Korea, enter. This large structure is designed to "upend" ITER's largest components (toroidal field coils and vacuum vessel sectors) from horizontal to vertical.
07 November 2019As smooth as an ice rinkEuropean Domestic Agency contractors are currently coating the floor of the ITER Assembly Hall (6,500 m²) with epoxy resin. A hard, perfectly smooth floor that will resist erosion is one of the main conditions for maintaining cleanliness during pre-assembly operations.
29 October 2019First zone completedThe area to be painted has been divided into four zones. One has been completed, in time for the delivery of the upending tool from Korea next week. A total of 24 tonnes of epoxy resin will be needed to cover the full floor surface of the Hall.
29 October 2019Shift of weightIn late September, the second 360-tonne load (at left) was transferred to SSAT tool #2 (on the right). After one month of functional tests on the second tool, the loads will be removed and stored until needed for the testing of the "upending" structure that has been shipped by Korea. (See more on that tool here: https://www.iter.org/newsline/-/3112)30 September 2019Antechamber to the Assembly HallAfter leaving storage, ITER's largest components will be submitted to a thorough cleaning process in the antechamber of the Assembly Hall, the Cleaning Facility (photo). The large doors will then open to allow the component, on its transport platform, to enter the Hall where the overhead cranes can take over. © Les Nouveaux Médias/SNC ENGAGE25 September 2019Rotated completelyThe wings of the first sector sub-assembly tool (SSAT1) have been fully rotated inward and the tool has performed as expected. Later this month, the mock loads will be transferred to SSAT2. Both tools will enter service in 2020.
04 September 2019Two mountedTwo mock loads were built in Scotland by Doosan Babcock and shipped to ITER for assembly. They represent a combined weight of 700 tonnes, now mounted on the tool SSAT#1. Rotational tests begin late in July.
23 July 2019A little push by hand ...
Even in the most technical of operations, there is always a need for final adjustment by hand. Seen vertically, the loads share the D-shape of the toroidal field coils they are meant to represent. They also reproduce the centre of gravity and mass distribution of the coils.
22 July 2019Inching upOne 350-tonne dummy load, representing a toroidal field coil, is slowly upended using both the double overhead crane at one end and a powerful telescopic crane at the other.
19 July 2019Travelling nowThe upended load is carried to the first tool, to be installed on one of its wings.
19 July 2019Two mock loadsTwo mock loads weighing 350 tonnes have been constructed from steel and concrete (far left) to represent the D-shaped toroidal field coils that will be mounted on the wings of the assembly tools. Lifting and installation will begin soon.
11 July 2019Open armsStanding in front of one of the sub-sector assembly tools is Swiss photographer Luca Zanier, who spent two days at ITER in July in pursuit of "unusual" perspectives in industry.
03 July 2019Inspecting the loadsMade of seven different steel-and-concrete modules, the dummies slightly exceed the weight of the actual coil but closely reproduce their centre of gravity and distribution of mass.
01 July 2019Preparing the liftThe load modules are held together by strong threaded tension bars called "Macalloys." The stress on these bars was tested recently by lifting the load several centimetres above the shop floor as part of preparatory activities for the real lift.
01 July 2019Steel and concrete modules to make the weightEach dummy load is made of seven assembled modules of varying weights.
01 July 2019Loads preparedLoad tests are about to start on the twin sector sub-assembly tools (SSAT). The mock loads in the foreground—weighing 350 tonnes each—will be installed on the tool "wings" to measure their capacity to rotate inwards and adjust to within millimetre tolerances.
12 June 2019Mechanical testing underway on SSAT toolsWith both sector sub-assembly tools (SSATs) now erected, mechanical load testing can start. In April, teams begin testing the movement of upper alignment units. Load testing is schedule for June.
25 April 2019Up highAt the top of the second SSAT tool, contractors are assembling the final elements.
10 January 2019A pair of hands is still usefulLessons learned from the first tool have reduced assembly time for SSAT-2 by approximately one-third. Still, some manual operations are still required...
10 January 2019Near twinsThe second SSAT tool is rising quickly in the Assembly Hall. Each of these 800-tonne behemoths can carry component assemblies of 1,200 tonnes.
29 November 2018Sturdy wingsPrecision hydraulics will drive the lateral wings of the SSAT tools, which rotate to deliver the toroidal field coils to their installation fixtures on the vacuum vessel sector.
29 November 2018A novel angleThis 800-tonne tool, seen from a novel angle, stands 22 metres tall and can handle a 1,200-tonne subassembly. And it will soon have an identical twin in the Assembly Hall ...
12 October 2018Well anchoredThe tools are solidly anchored in the concrete floor of the Assembly Hall. In the foreground is the footing arrangement for the inboard column.
12 October 2018Load tests next yearBoth tools will be tested with a full-weight dummy load, expected on site in March 2019. Load testing is the final tool qualification activity, allowing operators to verify the tools' ability to accurately adjust the dummy load toroidally and to six degrees of freedom within tolerances of +/- 1 millimetre.
12 October 2018From the raftersThe technician walking along the curved rails gives us a sense of the tool's scale. The first segment of tool #2 has been positioned for installation.
12 October 2018Assembly stationsOn the floor of the Assembly Hall, across from the SSAT tools, other bespoke handling stations will be installed—for example, for the assembly of the central solenoid.
12 October 2018Precise alignmentSpecialists are busy installing and precisely aligning the toroidal rail tracks upon which the wings of the giant tool will travel.
12 October 2018Tool #1All the pieces of the first tool are in place; only hydraulic and electrical connections must be installed. Ahead are functional tests (integrated system tests without the test load), followed by full-load tests.
12 October 2018Broadcast to the worldMedia crews were invited to tour the ITER site in early October, including the Assembly Hall where one giant tool stands and another is going up.
10 October 2018Soon ...two toolsThe assembly of the second tool starts next month. As the wall poster shows, there will be two identical handling tools working from 2019 on to equip the vacuum vessel sectors for delivery to the machine pit.© Les Nouveaux Médias/SNC ENGAGE05 September 2018ShimmeringA worksite crane is reflected from the mirror surface of the Assembly Hall in August.

The person standing on the support rails looks positively tiny next to the mammoth 47-metre-long steel girder ...
27 June 2016A balancing actBefore the lift, the load must be carefully balanced on the hook. This operation takes much longer than the actual lifting.
26 June 2016Like a giant blackboardCladding is now completed. In a few days, a giant poster of the ITER Tokamak will be installed.
24 June 2016Trolley rides to the topOn Friday 17 June, a trolley is lifted to join the two girders already in place. Operators moved the girders to the end of the building to free the opening in the roof.
17 June 2016Assembly Building in JuneThe cladding on the northwest facade of the building is nearly completed, and the crawler crane is in place for crane assembly.
14 June 2016June liftFour girders and four trolleys will be lifted into place over a period of 10 days. The first girders were installed on 14 and 16 June, followed by first of the four 100-tonne trolleys.
14 June 2016Gaining weightGear motors, wheels, braces, and electrical equipment ... the fitting out of the girders has added some 30 tonnes. Each girder now weighs 186 tonnes.
14 June 2016Through a hole in the roofA man-sized hook is passed through an opening in the roof by the beam of the crawler crane. The crane operator, with no direct line of sight to the lifting operations, receives radio instructions from the "rigger," who oversees the whole operation.

31 January 2016Installing crane beamsDuring ITER assembly, a pair of independent bridge cranes will run the entire length of the Tokamak and Assembly buildings, manoeuvring and transporting components. The first beams for the crane bay were lifted into place in January to trial the bolting operations. After all the beams are in place, workers will install the rails in time for the arrival of the first bridge crane late in June.
12 January 2016The entry point to the Assembly HallBefore they enter into the Assembly Hall ITER components will need to be cleaned using a number of different techniques such as compressed clean air, pressurized demineralized water, and special detergents. Construction of the Cleaning Facility is underway on the south side of the building.

11 September 2015The symbolic ribbon cuttingOn 11 September 2015, Director-General Bernard Bigot underlines the importance of the latest milestone achieved on the worksite: "Here, in this antechamber to the Tokamak Complex, the principal elements of the machine with be fitted out and preassembled. Without this building, there would be no assembly, and without assembly there would be no machine and no project."11 September 2015Successful lift operationThe roof segment of the ITER Assembly Building is successfully raised to its final position in September. Held in place by temporary jacks following a 14-hour lift operation, the 730-tonne metal structure will be secured to the side pillars in the weeks to come.
11 September 2015A few weeks to secure the structureWhen the roof structure is fully secured to the side columns, the temporary structures put in place for the lift cables (top) will be dismantled.
11 September 2015Centimetre by centimetreOver the course of 14 hours, 22 hydraulic jacks hoisted the huge structure along thick steel cables that hung from support structures that had been temporarily fixed to the top of the pillars.
10 September 2015And off it goesLaser metrology is used to verify the position of the structure as it is lifted. Tolerances of only 35 mm from highest to lowest point are permitted.
10 September 2015Lifted at 5 km/hourThe structure is first lifted 20 cm and left to hang in order to measure the deflection of the steel and check the hydraulic pressure of the jacks. Then, the structure is lifted at approximately 5 km/hour.
