Lavender Jiang is interested in geometric deep learning and its application in healthcare. In the past, Lavender had the pleasure of working on signal processing, neuroscience and robotics projects with Prof. José M.F. Moura, Prof. Pulkit Gover and Prof. Howie Choset. In her free time, Lavender enjoys cooking, bouldering, and playing video games.
Sarah Richardson, CDS Warner Music FellowSasha Richardson grew up in Jamaica and moved to the USA to attend college at 16. In 2021, she graduated magna cum laude from Fayetteville State University of North Carolina with a B.S. in Computer Science. As an undergraduate student, Sasha loved to explore knowledge in different areas of Computer Science, participating in research in bioinformatics, natural language processing, machine learning, and robotics. She also worked as an undergraduate learning assistant for the Introduction to Computer Science course. When she is not working or studying, she is spending time reading, being with family, and enjoying the outdoors.
2020-2021Lily Zhang, CDS DeepMind Fellow“It’s an honor to be awarded the DeepMind Fellowship, and I’m especially excited to be joining such a vibrant, interdisciplinary community at CDS.”- Lily Zhang,CDS DeepMind Fellow 2020Boyang Yu, CDS DeepMind Fellow“I’m so excited and grateful to be awarded the DeepMind Fellowship. The best thing about joining a supportive and inspiring community, such as CDS, is that we never run out of brilliant ideas. Just keep an open mind when going deep with data science.” — Boyang Yu,CDS DeepMind Fellow 20202019-2020Khasi-Marc Jamieson, CDS DeepMind FellowBorn in Kingston Jamaica, Khasi-Marc graduated from Vassar College in 2016 with a Double Major in Mathematics and Economics. During his undergraduate studies Khasi-Marc focused my research on the impact of highly skilled and educated immigrant workers on the US economy. After graduating from Vassar College, he spent three years teaching Middle school Mathematics and Computer Science in Brooklyn, New York. He is thankful and excited for the opportunity to study at NYU thanks to the DeepMind Fellowship and intends to channel his passion for mathematics and programming into a career in data science.
Aishwarya Kamath, CDS DeepMind FellowAishwarya is originally from Goa in India and grew up in Dubai, U.A.E, where she completed most of my school education. She obtained her bachelor’s degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering at Manipal Institute of Technology In India.
Towards the end of her bachelor’s, she developed an interest in machine learning and was delighted to be accepted into the Computer Science Masters program at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. There, she had the privilege of working with Professor Andrew McCallum, and with his support, she began exploring research in the field of natural language processing.
After graduating from UMass, she decided to experience working in industry and have been at the Machine Learning Research Group at Oracle Labs for the past year. In her capacity as a Machine Learning Engineer, she has been exposed to several interesting paradigms that are unique to industry and it has broadened her perspective on challenges in deploying machine learning algorithms in real environments. In the meanwhile, she continued to work on research projects and applied to PhD programs. She was thrilled to be accepted into the CDS PhD program at NYU and extremely honored and grateful for the DeepMind fellowship.
