Volatile compounds (VCs) have been suggested for several decades as fulfilling these criteria. However currently very little work has been done in trying to diagnose viral infections using VCs. Much of the work carried out to date involves the differentiation of bacterial and viral sources of infection and often the detection of bacterial and viral co-infection. However, this has usually been donein vitroand very little work has involved the use of human participants. Viruses hijack the host cell metabolism and do not produce their own metabolites so identifying virus specific VCs is at best a challenging task. However, there are proteins and lipids that are potential candidates as markers of viral infection. The current understanding is that host cell glycolysis is upregulated under viral infection to increase the available energy for viral replication. There is some evidence that viral infection leads to the increase of production of fatty acids, alkanes, and alkanes related products. For instance, 2,3-butandione, aldehydes, 2,8-dimethyl-undecane and n-propyl acetate have all been correlated with viral infection. Currently, the literature points to markers of oxidative stress (e.g. nitric oxide, aldehydes etc) being the most useful in the determination of viral infection. The issue, however, is that there are also many other conditions that can lead to oxidative stress markers being produced. In this review a range of (mainly mass spectrometric) methods are discussed for viral detection in breath, including breath condensate. Currently MALDI-ToF-MS is likely to be the preferred method for the identification of viral strains and variants of those strains, however it is limited by its need for the viral strains to have been sequenced and logged in a database.
Export citation and abstractBibTeXRISTable of acronyms1. IntroductionThe current COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted to people across the world the threat posed by viruses and limitations of the current virology testing. Common laboratory techniques in viruses' detection include real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method to detect the genetic material of the virus or serological methods such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on detecting specific antibodies from the human serum. Both methods have some limitations. PCR-based tests require appropriate well-equipped laboratories with the high biosafety level (BSL 2 or 3) and skilled laboratory technicians, while serology tests although easier to perform, may be limited by the fact that antibodies appear later during the disease course. Moreover, the current swab test is only effective when the virus is present in the upper respiratory tract (nose, mouth, and throat). As the virus descends into the lungs it will no longer be picked up by the swab, and there will be a delay prior to antibodies being produced [1]. It is during this window where a breath test has the potential to be ideal as breath is measured from the end tidal volume deep in the lungs. There is also evidence that viral respiratory infections could cause alterations in both the respiratory and gastrointestinal microbiome [2]. These microbiome alterations are likely to cause metabolite changes that could be detectable in either the breath or stool. The use of volatile compounds (VCs) has been proposed as a rapid, potentially low cost, and non-invasive diagnostic test for numerous disease states in recent decades [3–5]. The VCs profiles can be changed either by pathogens itself during infection, by host-pathogen interaction or host immune responses.
Another benefit to VCs tests is that they can often be carried out by semi-skilled workers; it might also be possible to develop a test capable of being self-administered, for instance rather like the breathalyser devices for alcohol, nitric oxide, and carbon monoxide. Developing a deployable VC test for viral detection would not just benefit pandemic level threats but would also help in differentiating bacterial from viral infections which, would not only help the fight against antibiotic resistance but also help make the correct choice of care pathway. These tests even have the potential to be carried out at the point of care if a device can be made simple to use, small, and low cost.
Viruses are non-living entities and as such do not inherently have their own metabolism. However, within the last decade, it has become clear that viruses dramatically modify cellular metabolism upon entry into a cell. Viruses have likely evolved to induce metabolic pathways for multiple ends. The production of free nucleotides needed for viral genome replication as well as amino acids necessary for virion assembly is highly increased after viral penetration into the target cell. Furthermore, in the case of enveloped viruses, an increase in the production of lipids used as membrane material is also observed. In addition, the alternation of cellular metabolism by viruses to produce substrates required for virus production e.g. viral glycoproteins as well as ATP, energy for viral replication is also necessary. In a number of viral infections glycolysis and fatty acid synthesis in the host cell are upregulated. An early study in 1961 showed that influenza A infections of chick embryo cell monolayers increased lactic acid production with concomitant uptake of glucose 3 h post-infection [6]. Recently, the first metabolomics and energetic profiling of norovirus-infected cells has been published which revealed increases particularly in glycolysis, and lesser oxidative phosphorylation, and in pentose phosphate pathway products during murine norovirus infection [7]. Interestingly, glycolysis may be increased or sometimes decreased in response to viral infection, (with benefits for the virus). Examples of viruses increasing glucose intake are dengue herpes and herpes simplex virus 1 with activation of glycolysis by increasing transcription and activation of the enzyme phosphofructokinase-1 with both viruses relying on active glycolysis for optimal infection, while Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes virus causes a suppression of glycolysis, i.e. a decrease of glycolysis products associated with viral replication.
Sanchez and Lagunoff 2015, have published a review on the viral activation of cellular metabolism which lays out the current understanding of the mechanisms behind these metabolic alterations [8]. As far as we could determine the first publication of the potential of VCs for viral detection was published in the Journal of Chromatography B: Biomedical sciences and applications in 1979, in which gas chromatography (GC) was used to determine virus infected sera from non-infected sera with 85.7% accuracy [9]. However, it remains majorly unchartered territory as to whether VCs are truly capable of detecting viruses, Thackeret al2019 has recently presented a review which discusses the current understanding of viral metabolism for a range of viral organisms [10] and in which many of the discussed compounds produced during viral metabolism are semi- volatile [10]). For respiratory viruses like influenza virus, when the disease take place in the respiratory track, it is obvious that VCs profiles exhaled from the lungs undergo significant changes during infection, therefore VCs profiles analysis can be used as an early measurement of viral infection.
Exhaled breath condensate (EBC) has been established as a potential source of respiratory biomarkers. Compared to the numerous small molecules identified, the protein content of EBC has remained relatively unstudied partly due to the methodological and technical difficulties surrounding EBC analysis, this has been reviewed elsewhere [11]. EBC mainly consists of water vapor, however a small fraction containing respiratory droplets derived from the airway lining fluid is also present, thus EBC was used as a sampling method for detection of respiratory viruses [12,13].
Suggestions for potential respiratory disease biomarkers, for viral and other microbiological infections would be an asset for the breath analysis community, particularly for the development of rapid low-cost testing.

These terms were accompanied by one or more of the following terms: volatile, volatile compounds, volatile testing, VCs, volatile organic compounds, or VOCs.
Specific instrumentation known to be appropriate for VC testing was also included: matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight (MALDI-ToF), secondary electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (SESI-MS), selected ion flow tube mass spectrometry (SIFT-MS), gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS), e-nose, electronic nose, sensor array, and sensor(s).
3. DiscussionThere are many methods which have been assessed for virus analyses, particularly assessing proteins and RNA of viruses e.g. ELISA, PCR, and TEM methods etc. This review however focuses on the potential of methods capable of rapidly and accurately measuring volatile and semi-volatile compounds for diagnoses. There are many metabolite analysis techniques capable of analysing semi-volatile (and non-volatile compounds), secondary electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (SESI-MS), Gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS), matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF), selected ion flow tube mass spectrometry (SIFT-MS), proton transfer reaction MS (PTR-MS), sensors (e.g. e-noses).
MALDI is most often used with time-of-flight (ToF) mass spectrometry, and is widely used for microbiological applications, a 2015 review on the use of MALDI-ToF for microbiology states that there are numerous applications and that the technique has been embraced by the community due to its rapidity, sensitivity, cost effectiveness. MALDI-ToF MS is mainly a protein/peptide-based diagnostic MS method that relies on the measurement of the molecular mass of the cellular proteins to determine the unique protein profile that is characteristic of the pathogen.
MALDI-ToF can be used to identify bacterial species in under a minute. It can be also used for viral identification; however, the relatively low protein content of viruses and higher molecular weight of viral proteins can be the limiting factors. Most importantly, the primary limitation of MALDI-ToF is that identification of isolates is dependent on a spectral database which contains the peptide fingerprints [14]. MALDI-ToF can also be successfully used for viral genotyping. Pourceauet al2011 used MALDI-ToF to assess enzymatic activity and were able to determine that the avian influenza A (H5N2) viral strain had a lower hydrolytic activity than the human influenza A (H3N2) strain [15]. This is indicative that there may be metabolic or pathogenic mechanisms that can be exploited to differentiate viral strains. MALDI-ToF has also been used to determine 60 variants of the hepatitis B virus (HBV). Using this technique there was a quantification limit of only 1000 HBV copies/mL, this group claim that the MALDI-ToF technique was able to detect twice the number of variants over what is capable by direct sequencing [16]. Furthermore, this technique was applied for identification and characterization of highly evolving influenza virus types and subtypes e.g. to determine a triple reassortant pandemic 2009 influenza strain [17,18].
MALDI-ToF is not new to the world of virology, Cobo 2013 published a review of MALDI-ToF for clinical virology [19]. This paper predicts that MALDI-ToF is soon to become the standard for the identification of bacterial and viral microorganisms. However, the paper points out that for this technique to become a mainstay in virology labs, some additional development of the technology is required. For instance, there remain inconsistencies around the extraction protocols which require tight quality controls. Moreover, the direct analysis of clinical samples with MALDI-ToF can cause matrix effects and negatively impact the reproducibility of the results, the solution is to grow the organism in question under well controlled conditions. This requires time, resources, skilled workers, and most often high biosafety level laboratories; viruses are also known to be difficult to grow even under ideal conditions [20].
There are also still questions surrounding data management and the reference databases needed for accurate organism identification. Perhaps the most significant issue faced by MALDI-ToF-MS is the time and effort required for in the sample preparation, automated processes are in development but they still require more development [19].
The related technique electrospray ionization (ESI) has been coupled to matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry which allows for 5 MDa analysis which means that DNA molecules can be analysed with this technique. In 2004 Bothner and Siuzdak used ESI-MALDI-MS to show that whole viruses can be examined for both mass and structure [21]. There is evidence that viral RNA molecules are found in tidal breath at a reported rate of <3.2 to 20 RNA particles per minute [22], which means that a techniques, that is capable of analysing large molecules, may be the ideal solution to rapid, and non-invasive viral infection detection.
While the viral pathogen itself may not produce its own metabolites there are still metabolites produced by the host cells including intra cellular compounds when the virus breaks out. Ritteret al2010 profile the intra and extracellular metabolites in animal cells when infected with influenza virus. The intracellular compounds measured consisted primarily of upregulated glycolysis metabolites such as pyruvate, isocitrate, and succinate [23]. While there is not a vast body of work in which VCs have been used with viral detection in mind there are some examples in the literature. For instance, Traxleret al2018 used needle trap micro-extraction with gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to analyse breath VC profiles of swine infected with influenza A virus. Six VCs were detected during disease progression: acetaldehyde, propanal, n-propyl acetate, methyl methacrylate, styrene and 1,1-dipropoxypropane. As VC profiles were significantly different between control (non-infected) and infected animals it suggests that breath analysis can constitute a completely non-invasive, novel tool for influenza monitoring in human medicine and animal health control [24]. Furthermore, Traxleret al2019 also used the same GC-MS method to determine changes in VCs in cells co-infected with virus and bacteria [25]. Detroit cells were inoculated with influenza A virus and compared with uninfected cells; the influenza A infected cells were also co-infected withStreptococcus Pyogenes. The bacterial co-infection was linked to increases in acetaldehyde and propanal; while the viral infection was linked to increase in n-propyl acetate [25]. Similarly, Purcaroet al2018 examined the VCs from cystic fibrosis epithelial (CFBE), CFBE infected with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and CFBE co-infected with RSV andP. aeruginosa[26]. In this case the GC x GC ToF-MS was coupled with solid phase micro-extraction, unfortunately this group was unable to differentiate between the RSV infected cells and non-infected cells, the reported receiver operator curve (ROC) was only 0.431 [26]. The same group has also expanding this work and performed VC fingerprinting of RSV and influenza A virus using three different machine learning techniques [27]. Training sets were first used followed by test sets, again a GC x GC ToF-MS was used to carry out the VC analysis. All three learning techniques random forest (RF), linear support vectors (LSV), and partial least squares- discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), had similar performance comparing influenza A virus with non-infected cells with ROC's ranging 0.78–0.82. The best result came from comparing RSV with non-infected cells using LSV which yielded a ROC of 0.84 [27]. These are encouraging results; however, it should be noted that testing these results on human participants has not yet been carried out.
SESI-MS is an ambient ionization technique which does not require sample pre-treatment. A fine mist of an ionization solution (usually acidifying or ammoniating) is sprayed directly into the flow path of analyte vapor prior to entering the MS module. This means that the analyte vapor can be introduced in real-time, with a breath exhalation for example. It also mean that that compounds in the analyte vapor can be ionized even if they are semi-volatile or even non-volatile provided they can be suspended in the aerosol [28].
SESI-MS has been used to differentiate several different bacterial lung pathogens in mouse models. Seven bacterial strains were differentiated using the breath of the mice with p < 0.0001 [29]. This same group have used SESI-MS on several occasions for similar studies all with a high level of success [30–32], for instance in 2013 this groups were able to use breath printing with SESI-MS to differentiateP. aeruginosaandS. aureusin mouse models [32]. SESI-MS has also been used to discriminate endogenous from exogenous compound on breath, this is an important step in mitigating exogenous interferents [33]. While SESI-MS is capable of analysing semi-volatile compounds there appears to be very little work done in which SESI-MS is used for viral detection/differentiation. SESI-MS, however, is currently still an emerging technique which was used on breath for the first time in 2007; thus, it has not had the chance to become a well-established mainstream analytical technique.
Although this review focuses on respiratory viruses it is interesting to add work on VOCs and other viral infections. GC-MS has also been used to analyse the stool of 27 rotavirus infected children and compared 26 children with other non-specified gastrointestinal problems. In this study 2,3-butandione and other aldehydes were reported as having higher frequency and abundance in the rotavirus samples compared to the non-rotavirus samples [34]. Another study on GC-MS presented at the European respiratory society meeting in 2018 included some work on human participants [35]. Breath from 139 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and breath from 22 healthy participants inoculated with Rhinovirus was analysed. Twelve VCs were shown to be increased when infected with Rhinovirus including long chain alkanes, unfortunately due to this being a poster presentation there is only limited information, and the compound names are not reported [35]. The presence of long chain alkanes might be expected however, as they are linked with oxidative stress which is an effect of viral infection on the body [36]. Recently a review has been published which sets out some of the metabolic pathways by which volatile compounds can be generated in the body by the oxidation of long chain unsaturated fatty acids [37]. The idea of oxidative stress markers being explored with a view to developing a test for early signs of influenza infection in humans has been done. Phillipset al2010 took breath from 33 healthy participants, prior to being given attenuated influenza vaccination [38]. The breath was analysed on GC-MS. It has been found that alkane derivatives were altered post vaccination being 2, 8-dimethyl-undecane as the primary compound, after 2 d the ROC was 0.82, 7 d 0.94, and 14 d 0.95. Importantly the markers found on the breath were not present when the vaccine was tested on its own [38]. In a similar study selected ion flow tube mass spectrometry (SIFT-MS) has been used also to monitor changes in VCs following vaccination. Mashiret al2011 monitored the breath of seven participants prior to and post vaccination with FluMist, which is the monovalent live intranasal vaccine for influenza A H1N1 virus [39]. On the third day post vaccination both breath nitric oxide and isoprene showed elevated levels. Also, on day three post vaccination 137 product ions were altered from the baseline readings taken prior to vaccination. This is indicative that there are metabolic changes associated with the immune response produced when challenge to a viral load [39].
Both these studies suffer small numbers and breath testing in general is still striving for standardized methods of collation. SIFT-MS benefits from real-time analysis capabilities which eliminates the need to store samples, however, in the case of highly infectious diseases this is not the most appropriate testing method. The use of thermal desorption has the benefit of being able to be collected at point of care, and provides stable storage for up to 1.5 months (according to Kang and Thomas, 2016 [40]).
There is also the possibility of development of portable sensor-based devices that could also be used at point of care or even potentially in people's homes. Goumaet al2017, describe a 3 sensor array which can detect isoprene, while human testing has not yet been carried out by this group they do claim that this device can be used to screen for 'virus based epidemics' [41].
In 2015 Qaderet alused to GC-MS to compare the VCs from 5 viral (influenza A and B, adenovirus, RSV, parainfluenza 1) and three bacterial strains all grown in blood culture, all of which are known to cause respiratory infection [42]. This group found good separation between viral and bacterial strains, 1-hexanol was only present in the viral groups and 1-heptadecene was only found in the bacterial samples, thus these were the primary differentiating factors, again compounds associated with oxidative stress are cited as being produced from both viral and bacterial culture [42].
Lipid characterization on the human coronavirus strain HCoV-229E has been carried out using ultra high-performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (UHLC-MS) [43]. This work showed that glycerophospholipids, and fatty acids were significantly increased, and that the linoleic acid and arachidonic acid metabolism were both greatly disrupted. Moreover, this group found that when the infected cells were supplemented with both linoleic and arachidonic acids the virus replication was suppressed. Similar findings come from Roeet al2011 who used GC-MS to analyse fatty acid composition in hepatocytes infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) [44]. In this instance again it was found that in HCV infected cells there was an increase in fatty acid concentration, in addition to a reduction in fatty acid mediators. The study also suggest that fatty acid transport and oxidation are also disrupted. In this case the fatty acids myristic, and lauric acids were shown to increase viral metabolism [44]. GC-MS fatty acids and cholesterol analysis has also been carried out on influenza A infected cells by Linet al2010 [45]. Two carcinoma cells lines (A549 (adenocarcinomic human alveolar basal epithelial cells) and AGS (human gastric cancer cells)) were infected with influenza A virus, in this case there A549 had 12 differentiating metabolites while AGS had 10. This is a strong indicator that fatty acid synthesis and cholesterol synthesis are altered by influenza A infection, the cholesterol dehydration product cholesta-3,5-diene was also found [45]. There is then some evidence that fatty acid analysis could be an excellent target for the viral diagnostics tests; this could even have the potential to differentiate between viral strains. Currently however, there is not enough work in the literature to make conclusions as the effectiveness of fatty acid analysis for viral diagnostics. We were unable to find any instances of this type of analysis involving human participants.
Mass spectrometry-based methods for detecting VCs have been well established, however, sensor-based techniques such as e-noses and GC-sensor methods are now emerging. For instance Khalidet al2013 present a GC-sensor system which was able to differentiate bladder cancer from symptom matched controls with 95.8% and 93.2% accuracy for cancer and control group respectively (following leave-one-out cross validation) [46]. In this approach the resistance change of the sensor is recorded, as such there is no qualitative data collected and thus the differentiation of samples into clinically relevant groups is based on the pattern of the trace recorded. Similarly Shepherdet al2014 used the same GC-sensor instrument to differentiate irritable bowel syndrome from inflammatory bowel disease with a sensitivity and specificity of 76% and 88% respectively [47]. In this paper an artificial neural network program was used to conduct the data analysis. This network is first trained with a one set of samples then a subset of the samples are used to test the result. This pattern-based analysis is becoming increasingly common as it factors in multiple features of the samples and does not rely on the identification of compounds which can be problematic. van Geffenet al2016 use the e-nose Aeonose to differentiate between COPD patients suffering viral infection versus non-viral infection, which gave an ROC curve of 0.74 and for bacterial infection versus non-bacterial infection the ROC dropped slightly to 0.72 [48]. This paper does not name any specific virus but does say that PCR was carried out for the 15 most common viruses in The Netherlands, similarly there was no mention of the specific bacteria in the non-viral infection group. The Aeonose also uses neural networks to enable it to handle the large amount of data that a sample is capable of delivering [49].
Two e-nose devices were also used by van der Scheeet al2015 to determine if wheezing in infants was induced by Rhinovirus [50]. Children that did not have a wheeze displayed a significantly different VC profile versus children with a wheeze with or without rhinovirus infection (ROC 0.77 and 0.81 respectively). However, once the symptoms had abated the rhinovirus infected children maintained the VC difference at an ROC of 0.84, while the non-rhinovirus group dropped down to an ROC of 0.67 [50]. This group suggest that prolonged inflammatory markers as a result of the viral infection are still present after the symptoms have cleared. The idea is that this feature could point toward the development of a VC test capable of differentiating early asthma indicators from respiratory pathogen induced wheeze.
The Breathspec gas chromatography ion mobility spectrometry (GC-IMS) also uses pattern based methods to differentiate samples. In Lewiset al2017 this device was used to differentiate bacterial from non-bacterial respiratory tract infections from breath. This groups had a ROC of 0.73 with a sensitivity and specificity of 62% and 80% respectively [51]. Due to the difficulty accurately identifying viral strains there was no specific viral investigation instead the group focus on bacterial versus non-bacterial infection. This is an important point as anti-biotic resistance is an ever-growing problem that needs to be tackled and one method for doing this is to reduce the number of anti-biotic prescribed. Thus, being able to rule out bacterial infection is an important step in identifying the correct care pathway.
Table1shows a breakdown of the key studies discussed in this review, where possible the compounds named in the differentiation of viral infected samples has been added along with the key findings of the study. The majority of the compounds identified as being from virus infected samples are associated with oxidative stress. It is important to consider that while oxidative stress might be a sign of viral infection it can also be brought on by a host of other conditions such as: cancers, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, cardio vascular disease, COPD, cognitive diseases, and even aging.

4. ConclusionsCurrently there is a limited body of work in which VCs, or semi-volatile compounds have been used for determining viral infection. Less than half of the studies in this review have used human participants, and of those that have the numbers have been low. In two of the studies using human participants the response to a vaccine is measured and assumed to akin to the immune response to a viral infection. Oxidative stress markers have been noted as being raised in response to viral infection which is not surprising however to the numerous other causes of oxidative stress these might not be the best target for a VC based viral infection test.
MALDI-ToF is clearly the most established technique for the characterization of viral strains, and it is difficult for techniques like GC-MS to compete when there are so many advantages to MALDI-ToF, namely it is rapidity, cost effectiveness, and accuracy. In pandemic conditions then such as those currently posed by the COVID-19 crisis MALDI-ToF is an excellent option for identifying that specific viral strain.
Electronic noses and other sensor-based techniques might also prove to be a useful addition in the non-invasive rapid detection of viral infection. While sensor-based techniques do not provide qualitative data they do use pattern recognition techniques which factor in the whole sample volatilome rather than focusing on specific compounds. These devices are also capable of being used at the point of care, and fit the criteria of being low cost, high throughput and easy to operate.
There is through a bigger question to answered, can a VC test be developed to determine whether an infection is bacterial or viral in origin? This would be crucial triage step for any clinic and would immediately point towards the best care pathway. Moreover, being able to determine the cause of an infection could drastically reduce the amount of antibiotics falsely prescribed which could help in the fight against microbial resistance. In this case there would be no need to differentiate specific viral strains for the VC test to have a positive impact in the clinical setting.
