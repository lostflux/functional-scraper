Edition 2019Two decades of pursuing and lauding the presentation of live electronic music and real-time audiovisual arts felt like a roll of the dice in 2000, but now, these forms have matured into vibrant, dynamic and truly contemporary sounds and sights. MUTEK’s unwavering commitment to this milieu has gone on to spawn a constellation of other editions, while establishing Montréal as a nexus for local talent and international rendezvous.

A/VisionsTim Hecker and Konoyo Ensemblehaunted the Place des Arts' Theatre Maisonneuve with a harrowing mix of ancient Japanese court music wrapped in 21st century electronic tapestries;Ryoichi Kurokawamesmerized with his meticulous and moving 3D renderings of ruins,Loscildrew us into his atmospheric terrain with deep ambient and monochromatic visuals inspired by early 20th century photographer Alfred Stieglitz; while Italian collectivefuse*conjured spells that produced a moving and poetic narrative with their mix of music, projections and the otherworldly motions of their dancer.
NocturneAlternating venues between Agora, MTELUS and 7 Doigts Studios, the Nocturne series—the backbone of the festival’s exaltation of live contemporary electronic music in its multitude of forms—Tuesday’s program was a pop-electronic cabaret that welcomed the once-shrouded-in-mystery Lithuanian duoDomenique Dumontwhose live versions of their beloved balearic songcraft charmed everyone. On Wednesday the focus shifted to audivisuality, and local artistLucas Parisdebuted a brand new work that fused perfectly the self-programmed genetic codes of his music with a unique new visual signature. American duoMatmosowned the stage to close the night, with their animated, joyful and profound performance based on sampled plastics, with all the political and climate-focussed implications very much intact.
Filling the MTELUS on Thursday night with 6 continuous, all-improvised hours of live electronic jamming,Circle Of Live with Dorisburg, Johanna Knutsson, Mathew Jonson, Matt Karmil and Sebastien Mullaertprovided an ecstatic, undulating techno-dream-soundtrack. Thursday night,Gudrun Gutstole the show with her charismatic presence and performance— and this following a deep lesson in texture and composition fromJan Jelinek. Techno reverberated through the auditorium on Friday night, withLotus Eater (Lucy & Rrose)delivering a ferocious live set, andVeronica Vasicka, pinch-hitting for a last minute cancellation brought a set that rose well beyond the call and sent festival-goers into another realm altogether.
Gene Tellem’sdebut live set opened the floor for beats from all angles Saturday, includingJlin, Nicola Cruz, and the show-stealing, energetic funk ofWajatta (Reggie Watts & John Tejada). Canadians and local heroes dominated Sunday’s denouement—with the debut performance ofGuillaume Coutu-Dumont’spolyrhythmic almost-jazz ensembleAuflassen, the vivacious betwixt-techno-house closing set from ex-Montréaler, current Berlin-residentThe Moledownstairs—and precocious local artistPrioriwrapping up the night upstairs with his playful and snappy grooves. Abtracted breakbeat and reggaeton fromBeta Libraeand the extended, techno-esque techniques of Norwegian sax playerBendik Giskealso distinguished themselves.
MotionRed Bullput their heft behind two programs that brought a panorama of sounds from around the world:Sinjin Hawke & Zora Jonesmixed their glossy new audiovisual concept with their hi-tech club-derived dynamism andOurilaid down a live set of her soulful, musicianly new songs. On Saturday,Rashad Becker and Enadelved into mesmerizing and minute sonic details andOvermono’smodular tinkerings burst into a frenzy of ingenious rhythms.
PlayThe place for imagination to run wild, the Play series hosted unique and adventurous sets fromStephanie Castonguayand her hacked digital scanners,CLON X NWRMTCCperformed their cyberpunk, simulated world A/V, Meta,Kathy Hindeenchanted with her Twittering Machines and eco-themes, andBen Shemietook off in directions that harnessed voice and feedback to arresting effect.
ExpérienceThe outdoor stage exploded on Wednesday with a full menu of Latin flavours, culminating with a big congregation for the free DJ set of Ecuador’sNicola Cruz. A 20-year circle was closed with the brand new set from Montréal’s microhouse geniusAkufen, Dust-e-1 and Pick a Piperpicked up accolades for their spirited beat-work, andJohanna Knutssonbrought a full arsenal of ambient weapons to Sunday’s opening spot.
AMPLIFY D.A.IAMPLIFY D.A.Iis an initiative developed by theBritish Councilin partnership withMUTEKin collaboration withSomerset House Studiosin the UK. Since 2018, the programme has connected an active network in Argentina, Canada, Mexico, Venezuela, Peru and the UK.
AMPLIFY D.A.Iis a platform that creates international visibility in the industry for women-identified artists and curators. The programme offers networking opportunities, showcases, exhibitions and performances, residencies, workshops, creative labs and field trips.
For the 2019 edition, the programme featured a new cohort of 20 artists and professionals from Argentina, Canada, Peru and the UK, who participated inMUTEKeditions in Montréal, Buenos Aires, and atEspacio Fundación Telefónica Limain Peru. Selected participants from the 2019 cohort will take part in workshops and showcase their work at Somerset House Studios later this year.

Presented in three locations in the heart of the festival’s perimeter, these artworks reflect the way in which the technologies, over time, have embodied our visions of the future.
Whether through the electronic reproduction of biological neurons, the creation of AI algorithms, blockchain, CGI or with the use of analogue techniques, the artists invite us to take a critical look at our present world, which already carries within itself the keys to a future in which machines and humans work together towards more equity.
This exhibition was made possible with the generous support ofTourisme Québec, theConseil des arts et des lettres du Québecand theMinistry of Culture and Communications, in partnership withSynthèse - Pôle Image Québecand theConseil des arts de Montréal.
MUTEKalso thanks theBritish Council, theCanada Council for the Arts, theSAT,Place des Arts,OBORO;Studio XX,HTCandMontVR.
