IBM Research-AlmadenUnlocking the Potential of Today’s Noisy Quantum Computers for OLED ApplicationsScientists at Mitsubishi Chemical, a member of the IBM Quantum Hub at Keio University in Japan, reached out to our team about experimenting with new approaches to error mitigation and novel quantum algorithms to address these very challenges. In the new arXiv preprint, “Applications of Quantum Computing for Investigations of Electronic Transitions in Phenylsulfonyl-carbazole TADF Emitters,” we – along with collaborators at Keio University and JSR - describe quantum computations of the “excited states,” or high energy states, of industrial chemical compounds that could potentially be used in the fabrication of efficient organic light emitting diode (OLED) devices.

The focus of work at SIGMOD 2020 ranges from adding graph querying to relational databases, to natural language interfaces to data, to operationalizing data for new AI workloads. Results to be presented includes work done at our IBM Research-Almaden and IBM Research-India labs, as well as by our summer interns from universities and our partners in other IBM units.

In large part, because of scaling, where integrated circuits are made with smaller feature sizes fitting more and more circuit elements in the same area of silicon at each technology generation. This sets our expectations that in […]Continue readingShare this post:IBM Research-AlmadenLearning Chinese-Specific Encoding for Phonetic SimilarityPerforming the mental gymnastics of making the phoenetic distinction between words and phrases such as “I’m hear” to ‘I’m here’ or “I can’t so but tons” to “I can’t sew buttons,” is familiar to anyone who has encountered autocorrected text messages, punny social media posts and the like. Although at first glance it may seem […]Continue readingShare this post:IBM Research-AlmadenIn Tune With the Heart of a Copper AtomOur team at IBM Research developed a new technique to control the magnetism of a single copper atom, a technology that could one day allow individual atomic nuclei to store and process information. In a paper published today in the journal Nature Nanotechnology, our team demonstrated that we can control the magnetism of a single […]Continue readingShare this post:IBM Research-AlmadenDetecting the Magnetism of a Single Atom’s NucleusOur team at IBM Research − Almaden in Silicon Valley has detected the magnetism of a single atom’s nucleus, a feat that opens the door to using the nucleus as a way to sense and control magnetism at the atomic scale. This breakthrough, recently published in the journal Science, was achieved by measuring the magnetic […]Continue readingShare this post:IBM Research-AlmadenSteering Material Scientists to Better Memory DevicesIBM researchers propose guidelines for novel analog memory devices to enable fast, energy-efficient and accurate AI hardware accelerators.

Dictionaries and ontologies are foundational elements of systems that extract knowledge from unstructured text, such as natural language processing, information extraction, and many other AI applications. Keeping dictionaries up to date as new content arrives is a crucial operation. We […]Continue readingShare this post:IBM Research-AlmadenExpert-in-the-Loop Helps AI Transition from Classroom to InternshipAt IBM Research we understand that humans and AI can accomplish more together, and our team at IBM Research-Almaden is focused on creating ways for IBM’s consultants to work smarter with new AI technology assets. This approach is known as human-in-the-loop or expert-in-the-loop. Working closely with AI technologies on time-intensive tasks can save experts up […]Continue readingShare this post:IBM Research-AlmadenHelping to Improve Medical Image Analysis with Deep LearningMedical imaging creates tremendous amounts of data: many emergency room radiologists must examine as many as 200 cases each day, and some medical studies contain up to 3,000 images. Each patient’s image collection can contain 250GB of data, ultimately creating collections across organizations that are petabytes in size. Within IBM Research, we see potential in […]Continue readingShare this post:IBM ResearchThe world is our labLearn moreConnect with us
