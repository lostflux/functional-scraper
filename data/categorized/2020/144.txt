Quantum ComputingContinuing the journey to frictionless quantum software: Qiskit Chemistry module & Gradients frameworkOctober 29, 2020 | Written by:Stefan WörnerandPanagiotis BarkoutsosCategorized:Chemistry|Physics|Quantum ComputingShare this post:We’ve taken another important step on our path towardsfrictionless quantum computing: A new release ofQiskitwith a completely overhauledQiskit Chemistrymodule, as well as a brand newQiskit Gradientsframework. Both enhancements pave the way for quantum application software that serves the needs of:READ:Introducing The New Qiskit Chemistry Module And Gradients Framework For Next-Level Quantum ComputingAn overhauled Qiskit Chemistry moduleThe Qiskit Chemistry module includes a variety of algorithms designed to be modular and extensible, while also providing high-level applications that enable subject matter experts to get started with quantum computing. This includes algorithms for electronic and vibronic structure calculations, as well as algorithmic primitives which can be used for higher-level applications. Recently, this allowed IBM Quantum and ExxonMobil scientiststo compute thermodynamic observables for the Hydrogen moleculeon the 5-qubitibmq_valenciaquantum processor using Qiskit.
“The development of the new Qiskit Chemistry module is both exciting and very important. It will enable scientists with limited exposure to quantum hardware to quickly begin to simulate interesting and relevant chemistry problems. Perhaps as important, this new module will also help scientists think ‘in a quantum way’ when solving some of our most challenging problems.”–Laurent White, Section Head, Computational Physics, ExxonMobil Research and EngineeringMany near-term quantum algorithms – including the ones available in the Qiskit Chemistry module – are variational, i.e., they use classical optimization to find a set of parameters which minimize an objective function, evaluated using a quantum computer. This objective can be an energy in quantum chemistry, an expected return in financial portfolio optimization, or a loss function in quantum machine learning. All in all, many quantum algorithms rely on efficient and robust optimization.
Introducing Qiskit GradientsThe new Qiskit Gradients framework provides an automated way to compute analytic gradients as well as functions, thereof, for a variety of problem classes, for instance in chemistry, optimization, and machine learning. This is achieved by automatically constructing the operators required to estimate circuit derivatives, and combining this with classical automatic differentiation techniques. The framework is integrated in Qiskit’s core algorithms, such that it is straight-forward to leverage it in existing applications. Further, it will serve as a building block for future application modules, such as quantum machine learning.
The Gradients framework not only supports the estimation of first-order gradients but alsoHessians, as well as theQuantum Fisher Information. This immediately paves the way to more advanced algorithms, likeQuantum Natural Gradients,Variational Quantum Imaginary/Real Time Evolution, orVariational Gibbs State Preparation. The Gradients framework is integrated in Qiskit’s core algorithms, such that it is straight-forward to use it in existing applications. Further, it will serve as a building block for future application modules, such as quantum machine learning.
