Factors such as climate change, population growth and food security concerns have propelled the industry into seeking more innovative approaches to protecting and improving crop yield. As a result, artificial intelligence is steadily emerging as part of […]Continue readingShare this post:IBM Research-IndiaIBM Researchers Receive Aegis Graham Bell Award for Work in Digital AgricultureThe earth’s population is 7.6 billion and will rise to 11 billion by the turn of the century. Somehow, we must feed this 45 percent larger population with 10-20 percent less farmable land, and far less farmers. At the same time, a significant fraction of land and productive crop yield will be converted into bioenergy […]Continue readingShare this post:IBM Research-IndiaAutomating Code Generation for Deep Learning Models from Research PapersIn an upcoming presentation at the 2018 AAAI Conference, our team of deep learning experts at IBM Research India propose a new and exploratory technique that automatically ingests and infers deep learning algorithms in published research papers and recreates them in source code for inclusion in libraries for multiple deep learning frameworks (Tensorflow, Keras, Caffe). With […]Continue readingShare this post:IBM Research-IndiaSupply chain finance on blockchain debuts in IndiaJust a year ago, the concept of blockchain was still in its infancy; at about seven years old, the open source platform serving the bitcoin network was still an “underground” technology, understood by few from both a consumer and developer perspective. Around that time, IBM joined 90 other tech and finance companies on the Open […]Continue readingShare this post:IBM Research-IndiaCricket Fans Score Big with DataAll-rounder James Faulkner was scoring well before his double wicket maiden that clinched Australia’s 2015 Cricket World Cup finals win over New Zealand. He was scoring with data, or maybe more appropriately, with #ScoreWithData, IBM’s social media insight into players, teams, matches, brands, cities, and fans during the Cricket World Cup – which is played […]Continue readingShare this post:IBM ResearchThe world is our labLearn moreConnect with us
