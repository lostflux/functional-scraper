[1]Theelementspresent in every amino acid arecarbon(C),hydrogen(H),oxygen(O), andnitrogen(N) (CHON); in additionsulfur(S) is present in the side chains ofcysteineandmethionine, andselenium(Se) in the less common amino acidselenocysteine. More than 500 naturally occurring amino acids are known to constitutemonomerunits ofpeptides, includingproteins, as of 2020[update][2](though only 20[needs update]appear in thegenetic code[clarification needed], plus selenocysteine, which is encoded in a special way).
[3]Amino acids are formally named by the IUPAC-IUBMB Joint Commission on Biochemical Nomenclature[4]in terms of the fictitious "neutral" structure shown in the illustration. For example, the systematic name of alanine is 2-aminopropanoic acid, based on the formulaCH3−CH(NH2)−COOH. The Commission justified this approach as follows:The systematic names and formulas given refer to hypothetical forms in which amino groups are unprotonated and carboxyl groups are undissociated. This convention is useful to avoid various nomenclatural problems but should not be taken to imply that these structures represent an appreciable fraction of the amino-acid molecules.
They can be classified according to the locations of the core structural functional groups, asalpha-(α-), beta-(β-), gamma-(γ-)or delta-(δ-)amino acids; other categories relate topolarity,ionization, and side chain group type (aliphatic,acyclic,aromatic, containinghydroxylorsulfur, etc.). In the form of proteins, amino acidresiduesform the second-largest component (waterbeing the largest) of humanmusclesand othertissues.
[5]Beyond their role as residues in proteins, amino acids participate in a number of processes such asneurotransmittertransport andbiosynthesis.
ContentsHistory[edit]The first few amino acids were discovered in the early 1800s.
[6][7]In 1806, French chemistsLouis-Nicolas VauquelinandPierre Jean Robiquetisolated a compound fromasparagusthat was subsequently namedasparagine, the first amino acid to be discovered.
[8][9]Cystinewas discovered in 1810,[10]although its monomer,cysteine, remained undiscovered until 1884.
[11][9][b]Glycineandleucinewere discovered in 1820.
[12]The last of the 20 common amino acids to be discovered wasthreoninein 1935 byWilliam Cumming Rose, who also determined theessential amino acidsand established the minimum daily requirements of all amino acids for optimal growth.
[13][14]The unity of the chemical category was recognized byWurtzin 1865, but he gave no particular name to it.
[15]The first use of the term "amino acid" in the English language dates from 1898,[16]while the German term,Aminosäure, was used earlier.
[17]Proteinswere found to yield amino acids after enzymatic digestion or acidhydrolysis. In 1902,Emil FischerandFranz Hofmeisterindependently proposed that proteins are formed from many amino acids, whereby bonds are formed between the amino group of one amino acid with the carboxyl group of another, resulting in a linear structure that Fischer termed "peptide".
[18]General structure[edit]In the structure shown at the top of the page R represents aside chainspecific to each amino acid. Thecarbonatom next to thecarboxyl groupis called theα–carbon. Amino acids containing anamino groupbonded directly to the α-carbon are referred to asα-amino acids.
[19]These includeprolineandhydroxyproline,[c]which aresecondary amines. In the past they were often calledimino acids, a misnomer because they do not contain an imine groupingHN=C.
[20]The obsolete term remains frequent.
Isomerism[edit]The common natural forms of amino acids have the structure−NH+3(−NH+2−in the case of proline) and−CO−2functional groups attached to the same C atom, and are thus α-amino acids. With the exception of achiral glycine, natural amino acids have theLconfiguration,[21]and are the only ones found in proteins during translation in the ribosome.
TheLandDconvention for amino acid configuration refers not to the optical activity of the amino acid itself but rather to the optical activity of the isomer ofglyceraldehydefrom which that amino acid can, in theory, be synthesized (D-glyceraldehyde is dextrorotatory;L-glyceraldehyde is levorotatory).
An alternative convention is to use the(S) and (R) designatorsto specify theabsolute configuration.
[22]Almost all of the amino acids in proteins are (S) at the α carbon, withcysteinebeing (R) and glycine non-chiral.
[23]Cysteine has its side chain in the same geometric location as the other amino acids, but theR/Sterminology is reversed becausesulfurhas higher atomic number compared to the carboxyl oxygen which gives the side chain a higher priority by theCahn-Ingold-Prelog sequence rules, whereas the atoms in most other side chains give them lower priority compared to the carboxyl group.
[22]D-amino acid residuesare found in some proteins, but they are rare.
Side chains[edit]Amino acids are designated as α- when the amino nitrogen atom is attached to the α-carbon, the carbon atom adjacent to the carboxylate group.
In all cases below in this section thepKa{\displaystyle \mathrm {p} K_{\mathrm {a} }}values (if any) refer to the ionization of the groups as amino acid residues in proteins. They are notpKa{\displaystyle \mathrm {p} K_{\mathrm {a} }}values for the free amino acids (which are of little biochemical importance).
Aliphatic side-chains[edit]Several side-chains contain only H and C, and do not ionize. These are as follows (with three- and one-letter symbols in parentheses):Polar neutral side-chains[edit]Two aminoacids contain alcohol side-chains. These do not ionize in normal conditions, though one, serine, becomes deprotonated during the catalysis byserine proteases: this is an example of severe perturbation, and is not characteristic of serine residues in general.
Threonine has two chiral centers, not only theL(2S) chiral center at the α-carbon shared by all amino acids apart from achiral glycine, but also (3R) at the β-carbon. The full stereochemical specification isL-threonine (2S,3R).
Amide side-chains[edit]Two amino acids have amide side-chains, as follows:These side-chains do not ionize in the normal range of pH.
Sulfur-containing side-chains[edit]Two side-chains contain sulfur atoms, of which one ionizes in the normal range (withpKa{\displaystyle \mathrm {p} K_{\mathrm {a} }}indicated) and the other does not:Aromatic side-chains[edit]Three amino acids have aromatic ring structures as side-chains, as illustrated. Of these, tyrosine ionizes in the normal range; the other two do not).
Anionic side-chains[edit]Two amino acids have side-chains that are anions at ordinary pH. These amino acids are often referred to as if carboxylic acids but are more correctly called carboxylates, as they are deprotonated at most relevant pH values. The anionic carboxylate groups behave asBrønsted basesin all circumstances except for enzymes likepepsinthat act in environments of very low pH like the mammalian stomach.
Cationic side-chains[edit]There are three amino acids with side-chains that are cations at neutral pH (though in one, histidine, cationic and neutral forms both exist). They are commonly calledbasic amino acids, but this term is misleading: histidine can act both as a Brønsted acid and as a Brønsted base at neutral pH, lysine acts as a Brønsted acid, and arginine has a fixed positive charge and does not ionize in neutral conditions. The nameshistidinium, lysiniumandargininiumwould be more accurate names for the structures, but have essentially no currency.
β- and γ-amino acids[edit]Amino acids with the structureNH+3−CXY−CXY−CO−2, such asβ-alanine, a component ofcarnosineand a few other peptides, are β-amino acids. Ones with the structureNH+3−CXY−CXY−CXY−CO−2are γ-amino acids, and so on, where X and Y are two substituents (one of which is normally H).
[4]Zwitterions[edit]In aqueous solution amino acids at moderate pH exist aszwitterions, i.e. as dipolar ions with bothNH+3andCO−2in charged states, so the overall structure isNH+3−CHR−CO−2. At physiological pH the so-called "neutral forms"−NH2−CHR−CO2Hare not present to any measurable degree.
[24]Although the two charges in the real structure add up to zero it is misleading and wrong to call a species with a net charge of zero "uncharged".
At very low pH (below 3), the caboxylate group becomes protonated and the structure becomes an ammonio carboxylic acid,NH+3−CHR−CO2H. This is relevant for enzymes like pepsin that are active in acidic environments such as the mammalian stomach andlysosomes, but does not significantly apply to intracellular enzymes. At very high pH (greater than 10, not normally seen in physiological conditions), the ammonio group is deprotonated to giveNH2−CHR−CO−2.
Although various definitions of acids and bases are used in chemistry, the only one that is useful for chemistry in aqueous solution is that ofBrønsted:[25]an acid is a species that can donate a proton to another species, and a base is one that can accept a proton. This criterion is used to label the groups in the above illustration Notice that aspartate and glutamate are the principal groups that act as Brønsted bases, and the common references to these asacidic amino acids(together with the C terminal) is completely wrong and misleading. Likewise the so-calledbasic amino acidsinclude one (histidine) that acts as both a Brønsted acid and a base, one (lysine) that acts primarily as a Brønsted acid, and one (arginine) that is normally irrelevant to acid-base behavior as it has a fixed positive charge. In addition, tyrosine and cysteine, which act primarily as acids at neutral pH, are usually forgotten in the usual classification.
Isoelectric point[edit]For amino acids with uncharged side-chains the zwitterion predominates at pH values between the two pKavalues, but coexists inequilibriumwith small amounts of net negative and net positive ions. At the midpoint between the two pKavalues, the trace amount of net negative and trace of net positive ions balance, so that average net charge of all forms present is zero.
[26]This pH is known as theisoelectric pointpI, so pI=.mw-parser-output .sfrac{white-space:nowrap}.mw-parser-output .sfrac.tion,.mw-parser-output .sfrac .tion{display:inline-block;vertical-align:-0.5em;font-size:85%;text-align:center}.mw-parser-output .sfrac .num,.mw-parser-output .sfrac .den{display:block;line-height:1em;margin:0 0.1em}.mw-parser-output .sfrac .den{border-top:1px solid}.mw-parser-output .sr-only{border:0;clip:rect(0,0,0,0);height:1px;margin:-1px;overflow:hidden;padding:0;position:absolute;width:1px}1/2(pKa1+ pKa2).
For amino acids with charged side chains, the pKaof the side chain is involved. Thus for aspartate or glutamate with negative side chains, the terminal amino group is essentially entirely in the charged formNH+3, but this positive charge needs to be balanced by the state with just one C-terminal carboxylate group is negatively charged. This occurs halfway between the two carboxylate pKavalues: pI=1/2(pKa1+ pKa(R)), where pKa(R)is the side chain pKa.
Similar considerations apply to other amino acids with ionizable side-chains, including not only glutamate (similar to aspartate), but also cysteine, histidine, lysine, tyrosine and arginine with positive side chainsAmino acids have zero mobility in electrophoresis at their isoelectric point, although this behaviour is more usually exploited for peptides and proteins than single amino acids. Zwitterions have minimum solubility at their isoelectric point, and some amino acids (in particular, with nonpolar side chains) can be isolated by precipitation from water by adjusting the pH to the required isoelectric point.
Physicochemical properties of amino acids[edit]The ca. 20 canonical amino acids can be classified according to their properties. Important factors are charge,hydrophilicityorhydrophobicity, size, and functional groups.
[21]These properties influenceprotein structureandprotein–protein interactions. The water-soluble proteins tend to have their hydrophobic residues (Leu,Ile,Val,Phe, andTrp) buried in the middle of the protein, whereas hydrophilic side chains are exposed to the aqueous solvent. (Note that inbiochemistry, a residue refers to a specificmonomerwithin thepolymericchain of apolysaccharide, protein ornucleic acid.) Theintegral membrane proteinstend to have outer rings of exposedhydrophobicamino acids that anchor them into thelipid bilayer. Someperipheral membrane proteinshave a patch of hydrophobic amino acids on their surface that locks onto the membrane. In similar fashion, proteins that have to bind to positively charged molecules have surfaces rich with negatively charged amino acids likeglutamateandaspartate, while proteins binding to negatively charged molecules have surfaces rich with positively charged chains likelysineandarginine. For example, lysine and arginine are highly enriched inlow-complexity regionsof nucleic-acid binding proteins.
[27]There are varioushydrophobicity scalesof amino acid residues.
[28]Some amino acids have special properties such as cysteine, that can form covalentdisulfide bondsto other cysteine residues,prolinethat formsa cycleto the polypeptide backbone, and glycine that is more flexible than other amino acids.
Furthermore, glycine and proline are highly enriched within low complexity regions of eukaryotic and prokaryotic proteins, whereas the opposite (under-represented) has been observed for highly reactive, or complex, or hydrophobic amino acids, such as cysteine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, methionine, valine, leucine, isoleucine.
[27][29][30]Many proteins undergo a range ofposttranslational modifications, whereby additional chemical groups are attached to the amino acid side chains. Some modifications can produce hydrophobiclipoproteins,[31]or hydrophilicglycoproteins.
[32]These type of modification allow the reversible targeting of a protein to a membrane. For example, the addition and removal of the fatty acidpalmitic acidto cysteine residues in some signaling proteins causes the proteins to attach and then detach from cell membranes.
[33]Table of standard amino acid abbreviations and properties[edit]Although one-letter symbols are included in the table, IUPAC–IUBMB recommend[4]that "Use of the one-letter symbols should be restricted to the comparison of long sequences".
Two additional amino acids are in some species coded for bycodonsthat are usually interpreted asstop codons:In addition to the specific amino acid codes, placeholders are used in cases wherechemicalorcrystallographicanalysis of a peptide or protein cannot conclusively determine the identity of a residue. They are also used to summariseconserved protein sequencemotifs. The use of single letters to indicate sets of similar residues is similar to the use ofabbreviation codes for degenerate bases.
[40][41]Unkis sometimes used instead ofXaa, but is less standard.
Teror*(from termination) is used in notation for mutations in proteins when a stop codon occurs. It correspond to no amino acid at all.
[46]In addition, manynonstandard amino acidshave a specific code. For example, several peptide drugs, such asBortezomibandMG132, areartificially synthesizedand retain theirprotecting groups, which have specific codes. Bortezomib isPyz–Phe–boroLeu, and MG132 isZ–Leu–Leu–Leu–al. To aid in the analysis of protein structure,photo-reactive amino acid analogsare available. These includephotoleucine(pLeu) andphotomethionine(pMet).
[47]Occurrence and functions in biochemistry[edit]Amino acids which have the amine group attached to the(alpha-) carbonatom next to the carboxyl group have primary importance in living organisms since they participate in protein synthesis.
[48]They are known as2-,alpha-, orα-amino acids(genericformulaH2NCHRCOOHin most cases,[d]where R is anorganicsubstituentknown as a "side chain");[49]often the term "amino acid" is used to refer specifically to these. They include the 22proteinogenic("protein-building") amino acids,[50][51][52]which combine into peptide chains ("polypeptides") to form the building blocks of a vast array of proteins.
[48]These are allL-stereoisomers("left-handed"enantiomers), although a fewD-amino acids ("right-handed") occur inbacterial envelopes, as aneuromodulator(D-serine), and in someantibiotics.
[53]Many proteinogenic and non-proteinogenic amino acids have biological functions. For example, in thehuman brain, glutamate (standardglutamic acid) andgamma-aminobutyric acid("GABA", nonstandard gamma-amino acid) are, respectively, the mainexcitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters.
[54]Hydroxyproline, a major component of theconnective tissuecollagen, is synthesised fromproline.
Glycineis a biosynthetic precursor toporphyrinsused inred blood cells.
Carnitineis used inlipid transport. Nine proteinogenic amino acids are called "essential" for humans because they cannot be produced from othercompoundsby the human body and so must be taken in as food. Others may beconditionally essentialfor certain ages or medical conditions. Essential amino acids may also vary fromspeciesto species.
[e]Because of their biological significance, amino acids are important in nutrition and are commonly used innutritional supplements,fertilizers,feed, andfood technology. Industrial uses include the production ofdrugs,biodegradable plastics, andchiral catalysts.
Proteinogenic amino acids[edit]Amino acids are the precursors to proteins. They join by condensation reactions to form short polymer chains called peptides or longer chains called either polypeptides or proteins. These chains are linear and unbranched, with each amino acid residue within the chain attached to two neighboring amino acids. In Nature, the process of making proteins encoded by DNA/RNA genetic material is calledtranslationand involves the step-by-step addition of amino acids to a growing protein chain by aribozymethat is called aribosome.
[55]The order in which the amino acids are added is read through thegenetic codefrom anmRNAtemplate, which is anRNAcopy of one of the organism'sgenes.
Twenty-two amino acids are naturally incorporated into polypeptides and are calledproteinogenicor natural amino acids.
[21]Of these, 20 are encoded by the universal genetic code. The remaining 2,selenocysteineandpyrrolysine, are incorporated into proteins by unique synthetic mechanisms. Selenocysteine is incorporated when the mRNA being translated includes aSECIS element, which causes the UGA codon to encode selenocysteine instead of a stop codon.
[56]Pyrrolysineis used by somemethanogenicarchaeain enzymes that they use to producemethane. It is coded for with the codon UAG, which is normally a stop codon in other organisms.
[57]This UAG codon is followed by aPYLIS downstream sequence.
[58]Several independent evolutionary studies have suggested that Gly, Ala, Asp, Val, Ser, Pro, Glu, Leu, Thr may belong to a group of amino acids that constituted the early genetic code, whereas Cys, Met, Tyr, Trp, His, Phe may belong to a group of amino acids that constituted later additions of the genetic code.
[59][60][61][62][27]Standard vs nonstandard amino acids[edit]The 20 amino acids that are encoded directly by the codons of the universal genetic code are calledstandardorcanonicalamino acids. A modified form of methionine (N-formylmethionine) is often incorporated in place of methionine as the initial amino acid of proteins in bacteria, mitochondria and chloroplasts. Other amino acids are callednonstandardornon-canonical. Most of the nonstandard amino acids are also non-proteinogenic (i.e. they cannot be incorporated into proteins during translation), but two of them are proteinogenic, as they can be incorporated translationally into proteins by exploiting information not encoded in the universal genetic code.
The two nonstandard proteinogenic amino acids are selenocysteine (present in many non-eukaryotes as well as most eukaryotes, but not coded directly by DNA) andpyrrolysine(found only in somearchaeaand at least onebacterium). The incorporation of these nonstandard amino acids is rare. For example, 25 human proteins include selenocysteine in their primary structure,[63]and the structurally characterized enzymes (selenoenzymes) employ selenocysteine as the catalyticmoietyin their active sites.
[64]Pyrrolysine and selenocysteine are encoded via variant codons. For example, selenocysteine is encoded by stop codon andSECIS element.
[65][66][67]N-formylmethionine(which is often the initial amino acid of proteins in bacteria,mitochondria, andchloroplasts) is generally considered as a form ofmethioninerather than as a separate proteinogenic amino acid. Codon–tRNAcombinations not found in nature can also be used to"expand" the genetic codeand form novel proteins known asalloproteinsincorporatingnon-proteinogenic amino acids.
[68][69][70]Non-proteinogenic amino acids[edit]Aside from the 22proteinogenic amino acids, manynon-proteinogenicamino acids are known. Those either are not found in proteins (for examplecarnitine,GABA,levothyroxine) or are not produced directly and in isolation by standard cellular machinery (for example,hydroxyprolineandselenomethionine).
Non-proteinogenic amino acids that are found in proteins are formed bypost-translational modification, which is modification after translation during protein synthesis. These modifications are often essential for the function or regulation of a protein. For example, thecarboxylationofglutamateallows for better binding ofcalcium cations,[71]andcollagencontains hydroxyproline, generated byhydroxylationofproline.
[72]Another example is the formation ofhypusinein thetranslation initiation factorEIF5A, through modification of a lysine residue.
[73]Such modifications can also determine the localization of the protein, e.g., the addition of long hydrophobic groups can cause a protein to bind to aphospholipidmembrane.
[74]Some non-proteinogenic amino acids are not found in proteins. Examples include2-aminoisobutyric acidand the neurotransmittergamma-aminobutyric acid. Non-proteinogenic amino acids often occur as intermediates in themetabolic pathwaysfor standard amino acids – for example,ornithineandcitrullineoccur in theurea cycle, part of amino acidcatabolism(see below).
[75]A rare exception to the dominance of α-amino acids in biology is the β-amino acidbeta alanine(3-aminopropanoic acid), which is used in plants and microorganisms in the synthesis ofpantothenic acid(vitamin B5), a component ofcoenzyme A.
[76]In human nutrition[edit]When taken up into the human body from the diet, the 20 standard amino acids either are used to synthesize proteins, other biomolecules, or are oxidized toureaandcarbon dioxideas a source of energy.
[77]The oxidation pathway starts with the removal of the amino group by atransaminase; the amino group is then fed into theurea cycle. The other product of transamidation is aketo acidthat enters thecitric acid cycle.
[78]Glucogenic amino acidscan also be converted into glucose, throughgluconeogenesis.
[79]Of the 20 standard amino acids, nine (His,Ile,Leu,Lys,Met,Phe,Thr,TrpandVal) are calledessential amino acidsbecause thehuman bodycannotsynthesizethem from other compounds at the level needed for normal growth, so they must be obtained from food.
[80][81][82]In addition, cysteine,tyrosine, andarginineare considered semiessential amino acids, and taurine a semiessential aminosulfonic acid in children. The metabolic pathways that synthesize these monomers are not fully developed.
[83][84]The amounts required also depend on the age and health of the individual, so it is hard to make general statements about the dietary requirement for some amino acids. Dietary exposure to the nonstandard amino acidBMAAhas been linked to human neurodegenerative diseases, includingALS.
[85][86]Non-protein functions[edit]In humans, non-protein amino acids also have important roles asmetabolic intermediates, such as in the biosynthesis of theneurotransmittergamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA). Many amino acids are used to synthesize other molecules, for example:Some nonstandard amino acids are used asdefenses against herbivoresin plants.
[98]For example,canavanineis an analogue ofargininethat is found in manylegumes,[99]and in particularly large amounts inCanavalia gladiata(sword bean).
[100]This amino acid protects the plants from predators such as insects and can cause illness in people if some types of legumes are eaten without processing.
[101]The non-protein amino acidmimosineis found in other species of legume, in particularLeucaena leucocephala.
[102]This compound is an analogue oftyrosineand can poison animals that graze on these plants.
Uses in industry[edit]Amino acids are used for a variety of applications in industry, but their main use is as additives toanimal feed. This is necessary, since many of the bulk components of these feeds, such assoybeans, either have low levels or lack some of theessential amino acids: lysine, methionine, threonine, and tryptophan are most important in the production of these feeds.
[103]In this industry, amino acids are also used to chelate metal cations in order to improve the absorption of minerals from supplements, which may be required to improve the health or productivity of these animals.
[104]Thefood industryis also a major consumer of amino acids, in particular,glutamic acid, which is used as aflavor enhancer,[105]andaspartame(aspartylphenylalanine 1-methyl ester) as a low-calorieartificial sweetener.
[106]Similar technology to that used for animal nutrition is employed in the human nutrition industry to alleviate symptoms of mineral deficiencies, such as anemia, by improving mineral absorption and reducing negative side effects from inorganic mineral supplementation.
[107]The chelating ability of amino acids has been used in fertilizers for agriculture to facilitate the delivery of minerals to plants in order to correct mineral deficiencies, such as iron chlorosis. These fertilizers are also used to prevent deficiencies from occurring and to improve the overall health of the plants.
[108]The remaining production of amino acids is used in the synthesis of drugs andcosmetics.
[103]Similarly, some amino acids derivatives are used in pharmaceutical industry. They include5-HTP(5-hydroxytryptophan) used for experimental treatment of depression,[109]L-DOPA(L-dihydroxyphenylalanine) forParkinson'streatment,[110]andeflornithinedrug that inhibitsornithine decarboxylaseand used in the treatment ofsleeping sickness.
[111]Expanded genetic code[edit]Since 2001, 40 non-natural amino acids have been added into protein by creating a unique codon (recoding) and a corresponding transfer-RNA:aminoacyl – tRNA-synthetase pair to encode it with diverse physicochemical and biological properties in order to be used as a tool to exploringprotein structureand function or to create novel or enhanced proteins.
[68][69]Nullomers[edit]Nullomers are codons that in theory code for an amino acid, however, in nature there is a selective bias against using this codon in favor of another, for example bacteria prefer to use CGA instead of AGA to code for arginine.
[112]This creates some sequences that do not appear in the genome. This characteristic can be taken advantage of and used to create new selective cancer-fighting drugs[113]and to prevent cross-contamination of DNA samples from crime-scene investigations.
[114]Chemical building blocks[edit]Amino acids are important as low-costfeedstocks. These compounds are used inchiral pool synthesisasenantiomerically purebuilding blocks.
[115]Amino acids have been investigated as precursors chiral catalysts, such as for asymmetrichydrogenationreactions, although no commercial applications exist.
[116]Biodegradable plastics[edit]Amino acids have been considered as components of biodegradable polymers, which have applications asenvironmentally friendlypackaging and in medicine indrug deliveryand the construction ofprosthetic implants.
[117]An interesting example of such materials ispolyaspartate, a water-soluble biodegradable polymer that may have applications in disposablediapersand agriculture.
[118]Due to its solubility and ability tochelatemetal ions, polyaspartate is also being used as a biodegradable antiscalingagent and acorrosion inhibitor.
[119][120]In addition, the aromatic amino acidtyrosinehas been considered as a possible replacement forphenolssuch asbisphenol Ain the manufacture ofpolycarbonates.
[121]Synthesis[edit]Chemical synthesis[edit]The commercial production of amino acids usually relies on mutant bacteria that overproduce individual amino acids using glucose as a carbon source. Some amino acids are produced by enzymatic conversions of synthetic intermediates.
2-Aminothiazoline-4-carboxylic acidis an intermediate in one industrial synthesis ofL-cysteinefor example.
Aspartic acidis produced by the addition of ammonia tofumarateusing a lyase.
[122]Biosynthesis[edit]In plants, nitrogen is first assimilated into organic compounds in the form ofglutamate, formed from alpha-ketoglutarate and ammonia in the mitochondrion. For other amino acids, plants usetransaminasesto move the amino group from glutamate to another alpha-keto acid. For example, aspartate aminotransferase converts glutamate and oxaloacetate to alpha-ketoglutarate and aspartate.
[123]Other organisms use transaminases for amino acid synthesis, too.
Nonstandard amino acids are usually formed through modifications to standard amino acids. For example,homocysteineis formed through thetranssulfuration pathwayor by the demethylation of methionine via the intermediate metaboliteS-adenosylmethionine,[124]whilehydroxyprolineis made by apost translational modificationofproline.
[125]Microorganismsand plants synthesize many uncommon amino acids. For example, some microbes make2-aminoisobutyric acidandlanthionine, which is a sulfide-bridged derivative of alanine. Both of these amino acids are found in peptidiclantibioticssuch asalamethicin.
[126]However, in plants,1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acidis a small disubstituted cyclic amino acid that is an intermediate in the production of the plant hormoneethylene.
[127]Reactions[edit]Amino acids undergo the reactions expected of the constituent functional groups.
[128][129]Peptide bond formation[edit]As both the amine and carboxylic acid groups of amino acids can react to form amide bonds, one amino acid molecule can react with another and become joined through an amide linkage. Thispolymerizationof amino acids is what creates proteins. Thiscondensation reactionyields the newly formed peptide bond and a molecule of water. In cells, this reaction does not occur directly; instead, the amino acid is first activated by attachment to atransfer RNAmolecule through anesterbond. This aminoacyl-tRNA is produced in anATP-dependent reaction carried out by anaminoacyl tRNA synthetase.
[130]This aminoacyl-tRNA is then a substrate for the ribosome, which catalyzes the attack of the amino group of the elongating protein chain on the ester bond.
[131]As a result of this mechanism, all proteins made by ribosomes are synthesized starting at theirN-terminus and moving toward theirC-terminus.
However, not all peptide bonds are formed in this way. In a few cases, peptides are synthesized by specific enzymes. For example, the tripeptideglutathioneis an essential part of the defenses of cells against oxidative stress. This peptide is synthesized in two steps from free amino acids.
[132]In the first step,gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetasecondenses cysteine andglutamatethrough a peptide bond formed between the side chain carboxyl of the glutamate (the gamma carbon of this side chain) and the amino group of the cysteine. This dipeptide is then condensed with glycine byglutathione synthetaseto form glutathione.
[133]In chemistry, peptides are synthesized by a variety of reactions. One of the most-used insolid-phase peptide synthesisuses the aromatic oxime derivatives of amino acids as activated units. These are added in sequence onto the growing peptide chain, which is attached to a solid resin support.
[134]Libraries of peptides are used in drug discovery throughhigh-throughput screening.
[135]The combination of functional groups allow amino acids to be effective polydentate ligands for metal–amino acid chelates.
[136]The multiple side chains of amino acids can also undergo chemical reactions.
Catabolism[edit]Degradation of an amino acid often involvesdeaminationby moving its amino group to alpha-ketoglutarate, formingglutamate. This process involves transaminases, often the same as those used in amination during synthesis. In many vertebrates, the amino group is then removed through theurea cycleand is excreted in the form ofurea. However, amino acid degradation can produceuric acidor ammonia instead. For example,serine dehydrataseconverts serine to pyruvate and ammonia.
[97]After removal of one or more amino groups, the remainder of the molecule can sometimes be used to synthesize new amino acids, or it can be used for energy by enteringglycolysisor thecitric acid cycle, as detailed in image at right.
Complexation[edit]Amino acids are bidentate ligands, formingtransition metal amino acid complexes.
[138]Chemical analysis[edit]The total nitrogen content of organic matter is mainly formed by the amino groups in proteins. The Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen (TKN) is a measure of nitrogen widely used in the analysis of (waste) water, soil, food, feed and organic matter in general. As the name suggests, theKjeldahl methodis applied. More sensitive methods are available.
