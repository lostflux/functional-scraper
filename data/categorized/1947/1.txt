JOURNEY THROUGH THE CENTURYThe story of Wits University is a time-honoured legacy. From our early beginnings in Johannesburg a century ago, to our plans to lead the fourth industrial revolution for the century ahead, journey through our finest and toughest moments in this 100-year timeline.
Our Early BeginningsPrior to the official opening of the University of the Witwatersrand in 1922, we began as a school in Kimberley in 1896.
Ever since,this University has been the epicentre of knowledge, growth and social justice. We have maintained our legacy of excellence by consistently providing quality higher education and staying at the forefront of innovation.
With our African roots and our global competitiveness, we're shaping a number of great minds, fighting for human rights, discovering life saving technologies and uncovering hidden gems. We're here and we're staying. For Good.
The University of the Witwatersrand is officially establishedWits is granted full university status in March 1922. Once the University was officially established, it appointed H.R.H Prince Arthur as Chancellor and Professor Jan Hofmeyer as Principal. The official opening ceremony only occurred on 4 October 1922 because of the postwar revolutionary strikes that were taking place for most part of the year.
From its beginning, authorities at Wits University were clear on three things that would not be compromised on at the University: first, that the academic standard must always be of the highest; second, that adequate infrastructure was to be a priority for staff, lecture halls and student residences; and third, that modern and expensive laboratory equipment was needed to provide the best environmental conditions for research. These standards of quality are still staunchly maintained at the University today and cements our internationally recognised academic programmes.
Phineas: Former Wits MascotA forlorn, armless figure in a tartan sash and kilt stands in a corner of the Wits University Archive. Known as Phineas, he was the University’s mascot for many years. On his head, he used to sport a “towering black busby”, which he lost, along with one of his arms, when he was kidnapped by UCT students shortly after inter varsity athletics in 1923. He was recaptured by Witsies after a seven year sojourn at UCT.
The original Phineas was the Highlander Mascor of University College, London. His name-sake Phineas II, was a seven-foot wooden replica used to promote a barber shop in Jules street, Johannesburg. Phineas II was loaned to Wits serve as its mascot in 1923. However, UCT abducted Phineas that year. Phineas III proved to be as slippery as his predecessors and fell into the hands of the University of Pretoria in 1930. This marked the beginning of raids between the two universities. Phineas III retired from active service in 1971.
Wits Professor discovers the Taung SkullProfessor Raymond Dart announced the discovery of the Taung skull, the first of Africa’s early hominids, and named the species Australopithecus Africanus. He published an article in Nature. This and later discoveries established his international scientific reputation and brought enormous prestige to the University.
The University of the Witwatersrand moves from Plein Square to Milner ParkIn 1923, the University gradually vacated its premises in Eloff Street to move to the first completed teaching buildings at Milner Park. The University had, at that stage, 6 faculties (Arts, Science, Medicine, Engineering, Law and Commerce), 37 departments, 73 members of academic staff and little more than 1 000 students. In 1925 the Prince of Wales officially opened the Central Block.
Government of the time reduces funding to universitiesSince the mid-1920s the government of the time under Barry Hertzog hinted that subsidies to universities were putting a strain on the state. In particular, they questioned the need for certain departments at Wits University, such as the School of Architecture and the Schools of Music and Bantu Studies. In 1929, the government took direct measures to cut funding to universities and Wits saw its state subsidy reduced to just 5%. Soon after this came the Great Depression, which further strained university funding.
Rag Day Commemoration 1929Rag Day (Remember and Give) was the climax of six weeks of activity aimed at raising funds for charity, which also involved the consumption of copious amounts of alcohol. A month before Rag Day, students took to the streets selling the Rag magazine, Wits Wits, a compendium of jokes and cartoons. A Rag Queen presided over a street procession of floats in the morning and the Rag Ball in the evening.
Champion Tree at WitsThe massive crown of a eucalyptus (blue gum) tree, measuring more than 38 metres from side to side, supported by a trunk of 7.5 metres in circumference, shades part of the Gavin Reilly Green on West Campus.
The tree was planted in the 1930s, next to the main road used in the 19th century by the early traders on the route between Rustenburg and Joburg when the city was still a gold rush town.
The Department of Agriculture initiated the Champion Trees Project to identify trees worthy of special protection throughout South Africa, under the National Forests Act of 1998. This tree is one of them.
First Wits Library, William Cullen, is officially openedConstruction of Wits' first library began in the early 1930s, and it was officially opened on 12 March 1934. At its opening, The Star newspaper stated that “It is considered that the Library should meet the needs of the University for at least the next 100 years…” A campaign was also started to populate the Library with books. Many came from private individuals, donations, scientific societies, and institutions in the United States and Canada. Thousands of volumes of books were collected and in 1974, the Library was named after William Cullen who played a major part in the reconstruction of the building and collection of its books.
Wits appoints first black staff memberWits University cements itself as an Open University and appoints its first black staff member, Dr B.W. Vilakazi, who went on to publish the first Zulu - English dictionary with another Wits professor. The infamous 'Vilakazi Street' in Soweto - where Nelson Mandela and Desmond Tutu lived - was named in honour of Dr Vilakazi.
Vilakazi’s poem “Wo, Ngitshele Mntanomlungu” (“Tell Me, White Man’s Son”) recalls his arrival at Wits and pausing at the sound of pigeons roosting above the columns of Central Block:Such massive and majestic columns,Drawing my gaze, where, high above me,Doves are perched whose noisy cooingIs like the bellowing of bulls.
Thus, as I gaze in wonder,I realise beyond all doubtThat I am lost! Yet well I know I cameTo serve my own beloved people –Aware of them always, I hear them cry“Take up your burden and be our voice!”Bernard Price Geophysical Research Institute is establishedWits University’s first research institute is established. The Bernard Price Geophysical Research Institute was funded and donated by Dr Bernard Price, who spent many years on the University Council. Important research on lightning and Seismology came out of research work at this institute. The Special Radar Unit of the Corps of Signals, under Brigadier Basil Schonland, developed and built equipment and operated the entire South African Radar activity from this institute.
Great Hall is openedThe Central Block building was an unfinished façade behind which stood a two-storey wood and iron structure, with a basement. It was only completed in May 1940 because of financial constraints. In June the Governor-General officially opened the Great Hall, without incident.
1st Zulu English dictionary published, Savernake Mansion hosts all Wits VCsA pioneering giant in Zulu literature,Dr B.W.
Vilakazi drew inspiration from his rural home in Natal. He created a new genre of poetry combining traditional Zulu praise-poetry with the blank verse form. Vilakazi’s plays, books and poems, along with academic articles, were widely published from the early 1930s.
First student protestThe first major protest by Wits students against fee increases takes place. This will set the tone for other student protests throughout the following decades at the University.
Wits Convocation Committee approves first ever African Medical ScholarshipsThe SRC at Wits requested the convocation committee set up a fund and garner financial support for African students to study medicine. The government at the time had stopped all bursaries to African students eligible to study medicine, and wanted medical training facilities for non-Europeans to be confined to only the Natal university. The request was approved by Wits convocation and public support was also received for the training of African students at Wits medical training facilities.
Wits Convocation Committee opposes segregation at universitiesWits University's Convocation Committee stated that it was solidly behind the Council, Senate, staff and students in regard to the independence of the University of the Witwatersrand and it supports wholeheartedly the concept of the University retaining its autonomy in regard to academic freedom.
"Furthermore, Convocation has already registered its strong protest at a Special General Meeting on 23 February 1954, when, by a large majority, it took exception to the appointment of a Government Commission to investigate the 'practicability and financial implications of providing separate training facilities for non-Europeans at the universities'." -Convocation Commentary, 1956Apartheid government enforces racial segregation in South African universitiesThe Extension of University Education Act was passed in 1959 and barred all non-Europeans from attending universities in the country. This went against the most important values of Wits University, particularly academic freedom. The University staged a protest in opposition to the new legislation when staff and students lined the streets of Johannesburg calling for government to end its interference in academic matters.
Also in 1959,King Kong,a landmarkSouth Africanjazz-influencedmusical held its opening at Wits University. It went on to tour the country over the next two years and played for multi-racial audiences.
Wits acquires Sterkfontein Caves, Wits Planetarium opens(Zeiss Projector)The Unknown Miner, and Wits acquires Nuclear ReactorWits becomes the first university in the country to own a computerWits University's Council made a decision to purchase a computer in 1961, and purchased one the following year. It was the first ever university-owned computer in South Africa. Apart from a machine owned by the CSIR at the time, it was also the only other scientific computer in the country. The University replaced the first computer with more advanced ones over the next 10 years - and maintained its position in the computing field in the decades that followed.
Student Union is officially openedAfter many years of deliberating on a suitable site for a student's union building, one was finally decided on in 1964 and still exists today. It has grown to become a hub for student life and interaction, houses a mini student shopping mall called The Matrix, is also home of the SRC, the centre of student clubs and organisations — and the place for awesome food.
Robert Kennedy visits Wits UniversityRobert Kennedy makes a seminal speech to a packed mixed audience in the Great Hall saying, “ So many of these I have seen, so many who are in this hall, are standing with their brothers around the globe for liberty and equality and human dignity; not in the ease and comfort and approbation of society, but in midst of controversy and difficulty and risk.”Kennedy was the first American leader to visit South Africa after the National Party came to power. He was highly critical of apartheid and committed to racial equality and civil rights in the US. Invited by the National Union of South African Students (NUSAS) to deliver the Annual Day of Affirmation Speech at UCT, he went on to speak at two other universities. The apartheid government found it difficult to handle his visit, because of its ambivalent dependence on the US. It refused to provide any security, and government ministers petulantly contented themselves with delivering insults, including that Kennedy was “a little snip”.
Wits Business School is establishedWits Business School was opened in 1968. It has an extensive Management Library, 24-hour meeting rooms and Africa’s largest Case Study Centre, housing over 200 real-life cases that bring relevant business challenges into the classroom. The main campus is in Parktown.
Free Peoples ConcertFrom 1971 through to the 1980s, Free People's concerts were hosted by Wits at various iconic venues from the Wits Library Lawns through to the Kloofendal Amphitheatre. It was one of the very few places were mixed races and bands were given an opportunity to come together.
Wits buys nuclear acceleratorWits University was the first university in South Africa to buy and operate a nuclear accelerator. The Tandem van Der Graaf generator called 'Daisy' was purchased for the Nuclear Physics Research Unit. These relatively compact machines pioneered the understanding of low-energy heavy-ion physics at just above the Coulomb barrier. Through the determined efforts of Sellschop, an EN Tandem van der Graaff accelerator reaching 6 MV was obtained from High Voltage Engineering Corporation, and installed in a purpose-designed building in 1973.
In 1972 at a Senate Committee meeting, the administration voiced concern over the abbreviation "Rand" cited on qualifications for academics and official publications from the University had become increasingly confused with Rand Afrikaans University. Suggestions were made to change the citation to WWR, WU, UW, Wits, and R'RAND. It was finally settled on "Wits" - which is the citation carried today on all academic credentials.
Wits Law Clinic opens, Student bannedThe Wits Law Clinic was established by Felicia Kentridge, who studied and lectured at Wits in the 1960s. She was a pioneer of public interest law in a time when no one else would provide these services. The Wits Law Clinic gave much needed support to impoverished black South Africans and it remains an important institution in South Africa today.
In its opening year, the Clinic handled 145 cases and in 1993 over 2000 cases.
In 2002, the Clinic successfully compelled the government to provide Nevirapine to HIV-positive mothers in a landmark case on mother-to-child-transmission, and fought for the provision of ARV treatment, which marked a turning point in the government's AIDS policy. It won another landmark case on housing in the infamous Grootboom case, which compelled the state to provide adequate housing to all its citizens.
Adler Museum opensThe Adler Museum was handed over to Wits University in 1974. It was founded in 1962 by Drs Cyril and Esther Adler. It is the only one of its kind in South Africa and is one of the most comprehensive history of medicine museums in the world.
Senate House is openedSenate House serves as the administration block of Wits. During the #FeesMustFall protests, it was referred to as 'Solomon House' by students.

Wits Bridging programme launchedThe Wits Bridging Programme was designed for disadvantaged students and started in the Centre for Continuing Education on a part time basis in the 1970s. It was officially launched by 6 faculties in 1982.
Wits Theatre is officially openedThe Wits Theatre complex first opened its doors in July 1983. Ten years before that, the plan for the theatre was first announced. In the intervening years money was raised from the public and private sectors and the complex cost in the region of R5 million.
The Schools of Dramatic Art and Music needed a laboratory where their students could learn to develop their craft; where they could experiment with the latest in performing arts technology and could display the results of their work and experiments to the university and the public at large; where this could be done in the comfort of relatively well-equipped venues.
For the first eight years of its existence, the occasional open air production was staged there when the winter nights were not too cold or it did not rain in summer. In 1992 it was enclosed and added a third venue to the complex - a 120-seater all enclosed theatre where work which cannot be housed in the other two venues can find a home. It has its own foyer space.
Amic Deck is officially openedThe Amic Deck was built to connect the east and west campuses of Wits University and was funded by Anglo American and De Beers. The 50 meter wide plaza was constructed from steel and glass, and spans the M1 highway. It gives pedestrians easy access to both campuses.

The Dalai Lama visits Wits, and scientific discoveries are madeWits VC Professor Loyiso Nongxa acknowledges social segregation among studentsAt an Alumni General Assembly and a special graduation ceremony for Wits graduates who boycotted their graduation, Professor Nongxa spoke about the social segregation that occurred at Wits University during the 1980’s despite the university declaring itself to be an ‘Open University’ at the time, and opposing apartheid segregation. He acknowledged the anger felt by many black graduates of Wits for their social experiences.
In his speech, Professor Nongxa said: "As Head of this institution, I wish to say `ngxe’ to each and every one of you, both within this Great Hall and those who couldn’t come. `Ngxe’ is a Xhosa-term which is an apology that conveys an acknowledgement of the hurt or anger or bitterness that was caused by an action or actions that could have been avoided or were beyond the control of the perpetrators. Ngxe! Is an appeal for a new beginning, closing the chapter on past experiences."Also in 2005, Wits alumnus Rory Byrne, chief constructor for Ferrari, is awarded an Honorary Doctorate. Byrne-designed cars have won ninety-nine Grands Prix, seven constructors' titles and seven drivers' titles. This makes Byrne the third most successful Formula One designer, behind rivals Adrian Newey and Colin Chapman.
