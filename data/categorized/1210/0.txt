ShogiShogi(将棋,shōgi,English:/ˈʃoʊɡiː/,Japanese:[ɕo̞ːŋi]or[ɕo̞ːɡʲi]), also known asJapanese chess(the game of generals), is a two-playerstrategyboard gamethat is the Japanese variant ofchess. It is the most popularchess variantin Japan.
Shōgimeans general's (shō将) board game (gi棋).
Shogi was the earliest chess variant to allow captured pieces to be returned to the board by the capturing player.
[1]This drop rule is speculated to have been invented in the 15th century and possibly connected to the practice of 15th centurymercenariesswitching loyalties when captured instead of being killed.
[2]The earliest predecessor of the game,chaturanga, originated in India in the sixth century, and the game was likely transmitted to Japan via China orKoreasometime after theNara period.
[3]Shogi in its present form was played as early as the 16th century, while a direct ancestor without the drop rule was recorded from 1210 in a historical documentNichūreki, which is an edited copy ofShōchūrekiandKaichūrekifrom the lateHeian period(c. 1120).
ContentsEquipment[edit]Two players face each other across a board composed of rectangles in a grid of 9ranks(rows,段) by 9files(columns,筋) yielding an 81 square board.
[a]In Japanese they are calledSente先手(first player) andGote後手(second player), but in English are conventionally referred to as Black and White, with Black the first player. The board is nearly always rectangular, and the rectangles are undifferentiated by marking or color. Pairs of dots mark the players' promotion zones.
[4]Each player has a set of 20 flat wedge-shaped pentagonal pieces of slightly different sizes. Except for the kings, opposing pieces are undifferentiated by marking or color. Pieces faceforwardby having the pointed side of each piece oriented toward the opponent's side – this shows who controls the piece during play. The pieces from largest (most important) to smallest (least important) are:Several of these names were chosen to correspond to their rough equivalents in international chess, and not as literal translations of the Japanese names.
Each piece has its name written on its surface in the form of twokanji(Chinese characters used in Japanese), usually in black ink. On the reverse side of each piece, other than the king and gold general, are one or two other characters, in amateur sets often in a different color (usually red); this side is turned face up during play to indicate that the piece has been promoted.
Following is a table of the pieces with their Japanese representations and English equivalents. The abbreviations are used for game notation and often when referring to the pieces in speech in Japanese.
English speakers sometimes refer to promoted bishops ashorsesand promoted rooks asdragons, after their Japanese names, and generally use the Japanese termtokinfor promoted pawns. Silver generals and gold generals are commonly referred to simply assilversandgolds, respectively.
The characters inscribed on the reverse sides of the pieces to indicate promotion may be in red ink, and are usually cursive. The characters on the backs of the pieces that promote to gold generals are cursive variants of金'gold', becoming more cursive (more abbreviated) as the value of the original piece decreases. These cursive forms have these equivalents in print:全for promoted silver,今for promoted knight,仝for promoted lance, and个for promoted pawn (tokin). Another typographic convention has abbreviated versions of the original values, with a reduced number of strokes:圭for a promoted knight(桂),杏for a promoted lance(香), and the全as above for a promoted silver, butと(ahiraganasymbol for the syllable "to") fortokin.
The suggestion that the Japanese characters have deterred Western players from learning shogi has led to "Westernized" or "international" pieces which use iconic symbols instead of characters. Most players soon learn to recognize the characters, however, partially because the traditional pieces are already iconic by size, with more powerful pieces being larger. As a result, Westernized pieces have never become popular. Bilingual pieces with both Japanese characters and English captions have been developed as have pieces with animal cartoons.
Setup and gameplay[edit]Each player sets up friendly pieces facing forward (toward the opponent).
Afurigoma振り駒 'piece toss' is used to decide who moves first. One of the players tosses five pawns. If the number of tokins (promoted pawns, と) facing up is higher than unpromoted pawns (歩), then the player who tossed the pawns playsgote後手 'white' (that is, getting the second move).
[5]After the piece tossfurigoma,the game proceeds. If multiple games are played, then players alternate turns for who goes first in subsequent games. (The terms "Black" and "White" are used to differentiate sides although there is no difference in the color of the pieces.) For each turn, a player may either move a piece that is currently on the board (and potentially promote it, capture an opposing piece, or both) or else drop a piece that has been previously captured onto a square of the board. These options are explained below.
Rules[edit]Objective[edit]The usual goal of a game is for one player tocheckmatethe other player's king, winning the game.
Movement[edit]Most shogi pieces can move only to an adjacent square. A few may move across the board, and one jumps over intervening pieces.
The lance, bishop, and rook arerangingpieces: They can move any number of squares along a straight line limited only by intervening pieces and the edge of the board. If an opposing piece intervenes, it may be captured by removing it from the board and replacing it with the moving piece. If a friendly piece intervenes, the moving piece must stop short of that square; if the friendly piece is adjacent, the moving piece may not move in that direction at all.
Aking(玉/王) moves one square in any direction,orthogonalor diagonal.
Arook(飛) moves any number of squares in an orthogonal direction.
Abishop(角) moves any number of squares in a diagonal direction. Because they cannot move orthogonally, the players' unpromoted bishops can reach only half the squares of the board, unless one is captured and then dropped.
Agold general(金) moves one square orthogonally, or one square diagonally forward, giving it six possible destinations. It cannot move diagonally backwards.
Asilver general(銀) moves one square diagonally, or one square straight forward, giving it five possible destinations. Because an unpromoted silver can retreat more easily than a promoted one, it is common to leave a silver unpromoted at the far side of the board. (SeePromotion).
Aknight(桂) jumps at an angle intermediate to orthogonal and diagonal, amounting to one square straight forward plus one square diagonally forward, in a single move. Thus the knight has two possible forward destinations. Unlikeinternational chess knights, shogi knights cannot move to the sides or in a backwards direction. The knight is the only piece that ignores intervening pieces on the way to its destination. It is not blocked from moving if the square in front of it is occupied, but neither can it capture a piece on that square. It is often useful to leave a knight unpromoted at the far side of the board. A knightmustpromote, however, if it reaches either of the two furthest ranks. (SeePromotion.)Alance(香) moves just like the rook except it cannot move backwards or to the sides. It is often useful to leave a lance unpromoted at the far side of the board. A lancemustpromote, however, if it reaches the furthest rank. (SeePromotion.)Apawn(歩) moves one square straight forward. It cannot retreat. Unlikeinternational chess pawns, shogi pawns capture the same as they move. A pawnmustpromote if it arrives at the furthest rank. (SeePromotion.) In practice, however, a pawn is usually promoted whenever possible. There are two restrictions on where a pawn may be dropped. (SeeDrops.)All pieces but the knight move either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. These directions cannot be combined in a single move; one direction must be chosen.
Every piece blocks the movement of all other non-jumping pieces through the square it occupies.
If a piece occupies a legal destination for an opposing piece, it may becapturedby removing it from the board and replacing it with the opposing piece. The capturing piece may not continue beyond that square on that turn. Shogi pieces capture the same as they move.
Normally, when moving a piece, a player snaps it to the board with the ends of the fingers of the same hand. This makes a sudden sound effect, bringing the piece to the attention of the opponent. This is also true for capturing and dropping pieces. On a traditionalshogi-ban, the pitch of the snap is deeper, delivering a subtler effect.
Promotion[edit]A player'spromotion zoneconsists of the furthest one-third of the board – the three ranks occupied by the opponent's pieces at setup. The zone is typically delineated on shogi boards by two inscribed dots. When a piece is moved, if part of the piece's path lies within the promotion zone (that is, if the piece moves into, out of, or wholly within the zone; butnotif it is dropped into the zone – seeDrops), then the player has the option topromotethe piece at the end of the turn. Promotion is indicated by turning the piece over after it moves, revealing the character of the promoted piece.
If a pawn or lance is moved to the furthest rank, or a knight is moved to either of the two furthest ranks, that piecemustpromote (otherwise, it would have no legal move on subsequent turns). A silver general is never required to promote, and it is often advantageous to keep a silver general unpromoted. (It is easier, for example, to extract an unpromoted silver from behind enemy lines; whereas a promoted silver, with only one line of retreat, can be easily blocked.) A rook, bishop, or pawn is almost always promoted, unless there is a problem due to "mate with a dropped pawn".
Promoting a piece changes the way it moves. The various pieces promote as follows:When captured, a piece loses its promoted status. Otherwise promotion is permanent.
Apromoted rook("dragon king", 龍王ryūō; alternate forms: 龍, 竜) moves as a rook and as a king. It is also called adragon.
Apromoted bishop("dragon horse", 龍馬ryūma; alternate form: 馬) moves as a bishop and as a king. It is also known as ahorse.
Apromoted silver(成銀narigin; alternate forms: 全, cursive 金), apromoted knight(成桂narikei; alternate forms: 圭, 今, cursive 金), apromoted lance(成香narikyō; alternate forms: 杏, 仝, cursive 金) and apromoted pawn(と金tokin; alternate forms: と, 个) all move the same way as a gold general. The promoted pawn is often called by its Japanese nametokin, even by non-Japanese players.
Drops[edit]Captured pieces are retainedin handand can be brought back into play under the capturing player's control. The Japanese term forpiece(s) in handis either 持ち駒mochigomaor 手駒tegoma.
On any turn, instead of moving a piece on the board, a player may select a piece in hand and place it – unpromoted side up and facing the opposing side – on any empty square. The piece is then one of that player's active pieces on the board and can be moved accordingly. This is calleddroppingthe piece, or simply, adrop. A drop counts as a complete move.
A drop cannot capture a piece, nor does dropping within the promotion zone result in immediate promotion. Capture and/or promotion may occur normally, however, on subsequent moves of the piece.
Restrictions.
There are three restrictions on dropping pieces; the last two of these apply only to pawns.
A corollary of the second restriction is that a player with an unpromoted pawn on every file is unable to drop a pawn anywhere. For this reason, it is common to sacrifice a pawn in order to gain flexibility for drops.
Captured pieces are typically kept on a wooden stand (駒台komadai)which is traditionally placed so that its bottom-left corner aligns with the bottom-right corner of the board from the perspective of each player. It is not permissible to hide pieces from full view.
It is common for players to swap bishops, which oppose each other across the board, early in the game. This leaves each player with a bishop in hand to be dropped later. The ability for drops in shogi gives the game tactical richness and complexity. The fact that no piece ever goes entirely out of play accounts for the rarity of draws.
Check[edit]When a player's move threatens to capture the opposing king on the next turn, the move is said togive checkto the king and the king is said to bein check.
If a player's king is in check, that player's responding move must remove the check if possible.
[6]Ways to remove a check include moving the king away from the threat, capturing the threatening piece, or placing another interposing piece between the king and the threatening piece.
To announce check in Japanese, one can sayōte(王手). However, this is an influence of international chess and is not required, even as a courtesy.
[7]Announcing a check vocally is unheard of in serious play.
[citation needed]End of the game[edit]The usual way for shogi games to end is for one side to checkmate the other side's king, after which the losing player will be given the opportunity to admit defeat. Unlike western chess or xiangqi, checkmate is almost always the result in shogi since pieces never retire from play which gives the players a sufficient number of pieces to deliver checkmate. That said, there are three other possible ways for a game to end:repetition(千日手sennichite),impasse(持将棋jishōgi), and anillegal move(反則手). The first two – repetition and impasse – are particularly uncommon. Illegal moves are also uncommon in professional games although this may not be true with amateur players (especially beginners).
Unlike western chess, there is no tradition of offering a mutualdraw by agreement.
Checkmate[edit]If the king is in check and there is no possible move which could protect the king, the move is said tocheckmate(tsumi詰み) the king. Checkmate effectively means that the opponent wins the game as the player would have no remaining legal moves.
[6](See also:tsumeshogi,hisshi.)Resignation[edit]The losing player will usually resign when the situation is thought to be hopeless and may declare the resignation at any time during their turn. Although a player may resign just after they are checkmated, playing up to the checkmate point rarely occurs in practice as players normally resign as soon as a loss is deemed inevitable – such as when atsume(forced mate sequence) is realized by the losing player. Similarly, if a player were to lose in an Entering King situation (see section below) by having less than 24 points (or by any of the other Impasse rules used by amateurs), then the player will usually resign before that point.
In traditional tournament play, a formal resignation is required – that is, a checkmate is not a sufficient condition for winning.
[8]The resignation is indicated by bowing and/or saying 'I lost' (負けましたmakemashita) and/or placing the right hand over the piece stands. Placing the hand over the piece stand is a vestige of an older practice of gently dropping one's pieces in hand over the board in order to indicate resignation. In western practice, a handshake may be used.
Illegal move[edit]In professional and serious (tournament) amateur games, a player who makes an illegal move loses immediately.
[c]The loss stands even if play continued and the move was discovered later in game. However, if neither the opponent nor a third party points out the illegal move and the opponent later resigned, the resignation stands as the result.
Illegal moves include:In friendly amateur games, this rule is sometimes relaxed, and the player may be able to take back the illegal move and replay a new legal move.
[9][10]In particular, the Two Pawn violation is the most common illegal move played by professional players. The Two Pawn violation played byTakahiro Toyokawa(againstKōsuke Tamura) in the 2004NHK Cupis infamous since it was broadcast on television. On the 109th move, Toyokawa (playing as Black) dropped a pawn to the 29 square while he already had a pawn in play on the board on the 23 square and, thus, lost the game.
[11][12]Repetition (draw)[edit]If the same game position occurs four times with the same player to move and the same pieces in hand for each player, then the game ends in arepetition draw(千日手sennichite,lit. "moves for a thousand days"), as long as the positions are not due toperpetual check. Perpetual check (連続王手の千日手) is an illegal move (see above), which ends the game in a loss in tournament play.
In professional shogi, a repetition draw outcome is not a final result as draws essentially do not count. There can be only one victorious through wins.
[d]In the case of a repetition draw, professional shogi players will have to immediately play a subsequent game (or as many games as necessary) with sides reversed in order to obtain a true win outcome. (That is, the player who was White becomes Black, and vice versa.) Also, depending on the tournament, professional players play the subsequent game in the remainder of the allowed game time.
Thus, aiming for a repetition draw may be a possible professional strategy for the White player in order to play the second replay game as Black, which has a slight statistical advantage and/or greater initiative. For instance,Bishop Exchange Fourth File Rookis a passive strategy for White with the goal of a repetition draw (as it requires two tempo losses – swinging the rook and trading the bishops) while it is a very aggressive strategy if played by Black.
Repetition draws are rare in professional shogi occurring in about 1–2% of games and even rarer in amateur games. In professional shogi, repetition draws usually occur in the opening as certain positions are reached that are theoretically disadvantaged for both sides (reciprocal zugzwang). In amateur shogi, repetition draws tend to occur in the middle or endgame as a result of player errors.
Impasse[edit]The game reaches anImpasseorDeadlock(持将棋jishōgi) if both kings have advanced into their respective promotion zones – a situation known as 相入玉 (ai-nyū gyoku"double entering kings") – and neither player can hope to mate the other or to gain any further material. An Impasse can result in either a win or a draw. If an Impasse happens, the winner is decided as follows: each player agrees to an Impasse, then each rook or bishop, promoted or not, scores 5 points for the owning player, and all other pieces except kings score 1 point each. A player scoring fewer than 24 points loses. (Note that in the start position, both players have 27 points each.) If neither player has fewer than 24, the game is no contest — a draw. In professional shogi, an Impasse result is always a draw since a player that cannot obtain the 24 points will simply resign.
Jishōgiis considered an outcome in its own right rather than no contest, but there is no practical difference. As an Impasse needs to be agreed on for the rule to be invoked, a player may refuse to do so and attempt to win the game in future moves. If that happens, there is no official rule about the verdict of the game.
[13]However, in amateur shogi, there are different practices most of which force a win resolution to the Impasse in order to avoid a draw result.
The first draw by Impasse occurred in 1731 in abishop handicap gamebetween the seventhLifetime Meijin,Sōkan Itō II[ja], and his brother, Sōkei Ōhashi.
[14]Entering King[edit]As a practical matter, when an opponent's king has entered a player's own territory especially with supporting defending pieces, the opponent's king is often very difficult to mate given the forward attacking nature of most shogi pieces. This state is referred to asentering king(入玉nyū gyoku). If both players' kings are in entering king states, the game becomes more likely to result in an impasse.
In the adjacent diagram example, although White's king is in a strongBear-in-the-hole castle, Black's king has entered White's territory making it very difficult to mate. Therefore, this position favors Black.
[15]An example of Entering King occurred in the fourth game of the 60thŌititle match betweenMasayuki ToyoshimaandKazuki Kimuraheld on August 20–21, 2019. After being unsuccessful in attacking Kimura and also in defending his own king within his camp, Toyoshima (playing as White) moved his king away from Kimura's attacking pieces by fleeing up the second file, ultimately entering his king into Kimura's camp by move 150. Although Toyoshima had achieved Entering King, he still had only 23 points—one point shy of the required 24 points for anImpassedraw—while Kimura (Black) had 31 points. Toyoshima then spent the next 134 moves trying to bring his point total, which fluctuated between 17 and 23, up to the necessary 24. By the 231st move, the game had reached a Double Entering Kings state, and by move 285 Kimura had successfully kept Toyoshima's point total at bay. Here, Toyoshima with 20 points (and Kimura at 34 points) resigned.
[16][17]Incidentally, this game broke the record of longest game in a title match.
[18]Amateur resolutions[edit]For amateur games, there are various guidances with little standardization.
Fairbairnreports a practice in the 1980s (considered a rule by the now defunct Shogi Association for The West) where the dispute is resolved by either player moving all friendly pieces into the promotion zone and then the game ends with points tallied.
[19]Another resolution is the 27-Point (27点法) rule used for some amateur tournaments.
[20]One version of this is simply the player who has 27 or more points is the winner of the Impasse. Another version is a 27-Point Declaration rule. For instance, the Declaration rule on the online shogi site,81Dojo, is that the player who wants to declare an Impasse win must (i) declare an intention win via Impasse, (ii) have the king in the enemy camp (the promotion zone for that player), (iii) 10 other pieces must be in the promotion zone, (iv) not be in check, (v) have time remaining, and (vi) must have 28 points if Black or 27 points if White. If all of these conditions are met, then the Impasse declarer will win the game regardless of whether the opponent objects.
[21]Yet another resolution to Impasse is the so-called Try Rule (トライルールtorairūru). In this case, after both kings have entered their corresponding promotion zones, then the player who first moves the king to the opponent's king's start square (51 for Black, 59 for White) first will be the winner.
[22][23]As an example, the popular将棋ウォーズ(Shogi Wars) app byHEROZ Inc.
used the Try Rule up until 2014.
[24](Now the app uses a variant of the 27-Point Declaration Rule – although it differs from the variant used on the 81Dojo site.) The idea of "Try Rule" was taken fromrugby football(seeTry (rugby)).
[25]Draws in tournaments[edit]In professional tournaments, the rules typically require drawn games to be replayed with sides reversed, possibly with reduced time limits. This is rare compared tochessandxiangqi, occurring at a rate of 1–2% even in amateur games.
The 1982Meijintitle matchbetweenMakoto NakaharaandHifumi Katohwas unusual in this regard with an impasse draw in the first (Double Fortress) game on April 13–14 (only the fifth draw in the then 40-year history of the tournament). This game (with Katoh as Black) lasted for 223 moves with 114 minutes spent pondering a single move. One of the reasons for the length of this game was that White (Nakahara) was very close to falling below the minimum of 24 points required for a draw. Thus, the end of the endgame was strategically about trying to keep White's points above the 24-point threshold.
[26]In this match,sennichiteoccurred in the sixth and eighth games. Thus, this best-of-seven match lasted eight games and took over three months to finish; Black did not lose a single game and the eventual victor was Katoh at 4–3.
Time control[edit]Professional games are timed as in international chess, butprofessional shogi playersare almost never expected to keep time in their games. Instead a timekeeper is assigned, typically an apprentice professional. Time limits are much longer than in international chess (9 hours a side plus extra time in the prestigiousMeijintitle match), and in additionbyōyomi(literally "second counting") is employed. This means that when the ordinary time has run out, the player will from that point on have a certain amount of time to complete every move (abyōyomiperiod), typically upwards of one minute. The final ten seconds are counted down, and if the time expires the player to move loses the game immediately. Amateurs often play with electronic clocks that beep out the final ten seconds of abyōyomiperiod, with a prolonged beep for the last five.
Player rank and handicaps[edit]Amateur players are ranked from 15kyūto 1 kyū and then from 1danto 8 dan. Amateur 8 dan was previously only honorarily given to famous people. While it is now possible to win amateur 8 dan by actual strength (winning amateur Ryu-oh 3 times), this has yet to be achieved.
Professional players operate with their own scale, from 6 kyū to 3 dan for pro-aspiring players and professional 4 dan to 9 dan for formal professional players.
[27]Amateur and professional ranks are offset (with amateur 4 dan being equivalent to professional 6 kyū).
[28]Handicaps[edit]Shogi has a handicap system (likego) in which games between players of disparate strengths are adjusted so that the stronger player is put in a more disadvantageous position in order to compensate for the difference in playing levels. In ahandicap game, one or more of White's pieces are removed from the setup, and instead White plays first.
Notation[edit]There are two common systems used to notate piece movements in shogi game records. One is used in Japanese language texts while a second was created for western players by George Hodges and Glyndon Townhill in the English language. This system was updated by Hosking to be closer to the Japanese standard (two numerals).
[29][30]Other systems are used to notate shogi board positions. Unlike chess, the origin (11 square) is at the top right of a printed position rather than the bottom left.
In western piece movement notation, the format is the piece initial followed by the type of movement and finally the file and rank where the piece moved to. The piece initials are K (King), R (Rook), B (Bishop), G (Gold), S (Silver), N (Knight), L (Lance), and P (Pawn). Simple movement is indicated with-, captures withx, and piece drops with*. The files are indicated with numerals 1–9. The older Hodges standard used letters a–i for ranks, and the newer Hosking standard also uses numerals 1–9 for the ranks. Thus,Rx24indicates 'rook captures on 24'. Promoted pieces are notated with+prefixed to the piece initial (e.g.
+Rx24). Piece promotion is also indicated with+(e.g.
S-21+) while unpromotion is indicated with=(e.g.
S-21=). Piece ambiguity is resolved by notating which square a piece is moving from (e.g.
N65-53+means 'knight from 65 moves to 53 and promotes,' which distinguishes it fromN45-53+).
The Japanese notation system uses Japanese characters for pieces and promotion indication and uses Japanese numerals instead of letters for ranks. Movement type aside from drops is not indicated, and the conventions for resolving ambiguity are quite different from the western system. As examples, the western Rx24 would be2四飛in Japanese notation, +Rx24 would be2四龍, S-21+ would be2一銀成, S-21= would be2一銀不成, and N65-53+ would be5三桂左成showing that the leftmost knight jumped (implicitly from the 65 square), which distinguishes it from5三桂右成in which the rightmost knight jumped.
Although not strictly part of the notational calculus for games, game results are indicated in Japanese newspapers, websites, etc. with wins indicated by a white circle and losses indicated by a black circle.
Strategy and tactics[edit]Shogi is similar to chess but has a much largergame tree complexitybecause of the use of drops, greater number of pieces, and larger board size.
[31]In comparison, shogi games average about 140 (half-)moves per game (or 70 chess move-pairs) whereas chess games average about 80 moves per game (or 40 chess move-pairs) andminishogiaverages about 40 moves per game (or 20 chess move-pairs).
[32][e]Like chess, however, the game can be divided into the opening, middle game and endgame, each requiring a different strategy. Theopeningconsists of arranging one's defenses usually in acastleand positioning for attack; the mid game consists of attempting to break through the opposing defenses while maintaining one's own; and the endgame starts when one side's defenses have been compromised.
In the adjacent diagram, Black has chosen aRanging Rookposition (specificallyFourth File Rook) where the rook has been moved leftward away from its starting position. Additionally, Black is utilizing aSilver Crown castle, which is a type of fortification structure constructed with one silver and two gold pieces and the king moved inside of the fortification – thesilver crownname comes from the silver being positioned directly above the king's head on the 27 square as if it were a crown. In the diagram, White has chosen aStatic Rookposition, in which the rook remains on its starting square. This Static Rook position is specifically a type of Counter-Ranging Rook position known asBear-in-the-hole Static Rookthat uses anBear-in-the-hole castle. The Bear-in-the-hole fortification has the king moved all the way into very edge corner of the board on the 11 square as if it were a badger in a hole with a silver moved to the 22 square in order to close up the hole and additional reinforcing golds on 31 and 32 squares. This board position required 33 moves (or 12 move pairs as counted in western chess) to construct.
Etiquette[edit]Shogi players are expected to follow etiquette in addition to rules explicitly described. Commonly accepted etiquette include the following:Shogi piece sets may contain two types of king pieces,王(king) and玉(jewel). In this case, the higher classed player, in either social or genuine shogi player rank, may take the king piece. For example, intitleholder systemgames, the current titleholder takes the king piece as the higher.
The higher-ranked (or older) player also sits facing the door of the room and is the person who takes the pieces out of the piece box.
[33]Shogi does not have atouch-move ruleas in western chess tournament play orchu shogi. However, in professional games, a piece is considered to be moved when the piece has been let go of. In both amateur and professional play, any piece may be touched in order to adjust its centralization within its square (to look tidy).
[34]Taking back moves (待ったmatta) in professional games is prohibited. However, in friendly amateur games in Japan, it is often permitted.
Professional players are required to follow several ritualistic etiquette prescriptions such as kneeling exactly 15 centimeters from the shogi board, sitting in the formalseizaposition, etc.
[35]Game setup[edit]Traditionally, the order of placing the pieces on the board is determined. There are two commonly used orders, theŌhashiorder 大橋流 and theItōorder 伊藤流.
[36]Placement sets pieces with multiples (generals, knights, lances) from left to right in all cases, and follows the order:Furigoma[edit]Among amateur tournaments, the higher-ranked player or defending champion performs the piece toss. In professional games, the furigoma is done on the behalf of the higher-ranked player/champion by the timekeeper who kneels by the side of the higher-ranked player and tosses the pawn pieces onto a silk cloth.
[33]In friendly amateur games, a player will ask the opponent to toss the pawns out of politeness. Otherwise, the person who tosses the pawns can be determined byRock–paper–scissors.
[37]History[edit]FromThe Chess Variant Pages:[1]The world's first chess variant,chaturangaarose in India in approximately the seventh century AD. From there it migrated both westward and northward, mutating along the way. The western branch became shatranj in Arabia and Orthodox Chess in Europe. The northern branch becamexiangqiin China andjanggiin Korea. Sometime in the tenth to twelfth centuries, 'chess' crossed the channel to Japan where it spawned a number of interesting variants. One of these was called 'Small Shogi'. Eventually, Small Shogi (though it went through many forms) won out over the larger variants and is now referred to simply as 'Shogi'. It is certain that Shogi in its present form was played in Japan as early as the 16th century.
It is not clear when chess was brought to Japan. The earliest generally accepted mention of shogi is Shin Saru Gakuki(新猿楽記)(1058–1064) by Fujiwara Akihira. The oldest archaeological evidence is a group of 16 shogi pieces excavated from the grounds ofKōfuku-jiinNara Prefecture. As it was physically associated with a wooden tablet written on in the sixth year ofTenki(1058), the pieces are thought to date from that period. These simple pieces were cut from a writing plaque in the same five-sided shape as modern pieces, with the names of the pieces written on them.
The dictionary of common folk culture, Nichūreki(二中歴)(c. 1210–1221), a collection based on the two works Shōchūreki(掌中歴)and Kaichūreki(懐中歴), describes two forms of shogi, large(dai)shogi and small(shō)shogi. These are now calledHeian shogi(or Heian small shogi) andHeian dai shogi. Heian small shogi is the version on which modern shogi is based, but theNichūrekistates that one wins if one's opponent is reduced to a single king, indicating that drops had not yet been introduced. According to Kōji Shimizu, chief researcher at the Archaeological Institute of Kashihara, Nara Prefecture, the names of the Heian shogi pieces keep those ofchaturanga(general, elephant, horse, chariot and soldier), and add to them the five treasures of Buddhism (jade, gold, silver,katsura tree, and incense).
Around the 13th century the game ofdai shogideveloped, created by increasing the number of pieces in Heian shogi, as wassho shogi, which added the rook, bishop, and drunken elephant from dai shogi to Heian shogi. The drunken elephant steps one square in any direction except directly backward, and promotes to the prince, which acts as a second king and must also be captured along with the original king for the other player to win. Around the 15th century, the rules of dai shogi were simplified, creating the game ofchu shogi. Chu shogi, like its parent dai shogi, contains many distinct pieces, such as the queen (identical with Western chess) and the lion (which moves like a king, but twice per turn, potentially being able to capture twice, among other idiosyncrasies). The popularity of dai shogi soon waned in favour of chu shogi, until it stopped being played commonly. Chu shogi rivalled sho shogi in popularity until the introduction of drops in the latter, upon which standard shogi became ascendant, although chu shogi was still commonly played until about World War II, especially inKyoto.
It is thought that the rules of standard shogi were fixed in the 16th century, when the drunken elephant was removed from the set of pieces present in sho shogi. There is no clear record of when drops were introduced, however.
In theEdo period, shogi variants were greatly expanded:tenjiku shogi,dai dai shogi,maka dai dai shogi,tai shogi, andtaikyoku shogiwere all invented. It is thought that these were played to only a very limited extent, however. Both standard shogi andGowere promoted by theTokugawa shogunate. In 1612, the shogunate passed a law giving endowments to top shogi players (Meijin(名人)). During the reign of the eighth shōgun,Tokugawa Yoshimune, castle shogi tournaments were held once a year on the 17th day ofKannazuki, corresponding to November 17, which isShogi Dayon the modern calendar.
The title ofmeijinbecame hereditary in the Ōhashi and Itō families until the fall of the shogunate, when it came to be passed by recommendation. Today the title is used for the winner of theMeijin-sencompetition, the first modern title match. From around 1899,newspapersbegan to publish records of shogi matches, and high-ranking players formed alliances with the aim of having their games published. In 1909, the Shogi Association(将棋同盟社)was formed, and in 1924, the Tokyo Shogi Association(東京将棋連盟)was formed. This was an early incarnation of the modernJapan Shogi Association(日本将棋連盟,nihon shōgi renmei), or JSA, and 1924 is considered by the JSA to be the date it was founded.
[38]In 1935,meijinKinjirō Sekinestepped down, and the rank of meijin came to be awarded to the winner of aMeijin title match(名人戦,meijin-sen).
Yoshio Kimura(木村義雄)became the first Meijin under this system in 1937. This was the start of theshogi title matches(seetitleholder system). After the war other tournaments were promoted to title matches, culminating with theRyūō title match(竜王戦,ryūō-sen)in 1988 for the modern line-up of seven. About 200 professional shogi players compete. Each year, the title holder defends the title against a challenger chosen from knockout or round matches.
After the Second World War,SCAP(occupational government mainly led by US) tried to eliminate all "feudal" factors from Japanese society and shogi was included in the possible list of items to be banned along withBushido(philosophy of samurai) and other things. The reason for banning shogi for SCAP was its exceptional character as a board game seen in the usage of captured pieces. SCAP insisted that this could lead to the idea of prisoner abuse. ButKozo Masuda, then one of the top professional shogi players, when summoned to the SCAP headquarters for an investigation, criticized such understanding of shogi and insisted that it is not shogi but western chess that potentially contains the idea of prisoner abuse because it just kills the pieces of the opponent while shogi is rather democratic for giving prisoners the chance to get back into the game. Masuda also said that chess contradicts the ideal of gender equality in western society because the king shields itself behind the queen and runs away. Masuda's assertion is said to have eventually led to the exemption of shogi from the list of items to be banned.
[39]Tournament play[edit]There are two organizations for shogi professional players in Japan: the JSA, and theLadies' Professional Shogi-players' Association of Japan[ja](日本女子プロ将棋協会,nihon joshi puro shōgi kyōkai), or LPSA. The JSA is the primary organization for men and women's professional shogi[38]while the LPSA is a group of women professionals who broke away from the JSA in 2007 to establish their own independent organization.
[40]Both organize tournaments for their members and have reached an agreement to cooperate with each other to promote shogi through events and other activities.
[41]Top professional players are fairly well-paid from tournament earnings. In 2016, the highest tournament earners wereYoshiharu HabuandAkira Watanabewho earned ¥91,500,000 and ¥73,900,000. (The tenth highest earner,Kouichi Fukaura, won ¥18,490,000.)[42]The JSA recognizes two categories of shogi professionals: Professional(棋士,kishi), and Female Professional(女流棋士,joryūkishi). Sometimeskishiare addressed as seikishi(正棋士), a term fromGoused to distinguishkishifrom other classes of players. JSA professional ranks and female professional ranks are not equivalent and each has their own promotion criteria and ranking system. In 2006, the JSA officially granted women "professional status". This is not equivalent, however, to the more traditional way of "gaining professional status", i.e., being promoted from the "Shoreikai System"(奨励会): leagues of strong amateur players aspiring to become a professional. Rather, it is a separate system especially designed for female professionals. Qualified amateurs, regardless of gender, may apply for the "Shoreikai System" and all those who successfully "graduate" are grantedkishistatus; however, no woman has yet to accomplish this feat (the highest women have reached is "Shoreikai 3danleague" byKana SatomiandTomoka Nishiyama), sokishiisde factoonly used to refer to male shogi professionals.
[43]The JSA is the only body which can organize tournaments for professionals, e.g., the eight major tournaments in thetitleholder systemand other professional tournaments. In 1996,Yoshiharu Habubecame the onlykishito hold seven major titles at the same time. For female professionals, both the JSA and LPSA organize tournaments, either jointly or separately. Tournaments for amateurs may be organized by the JSA and LPSA as well as local clubs, newspapers, private corporations, educational institutions or municipal governments for cities or prefectures under the guidance of the JSA or LPSA.
Since the 1990s, shogi has grown in popularity outside Japan, particularly in thePeople's Republic of China, and especially inShanghai. The January 2006 edition ofKindai Shogi(近代将棋)stated that there were 120,000 shogi players in Shanghai. The spread of the game to countries where Chinese characters are not in common use, however, has been slower.
In Europe[edit]As of November 2017[update], in Europe there are currently over 1,200 active players.
[44]Computer shogi[edit]Shogi has the highestgame complexityof all popular chess variants. Computers have steadily improved in playing shogi since the 1970s. In 2007, champion Yoshiharu Habu estimated the strength of the 2006 world computer shogi champion Bonanza at the level of two-dan shoreikai.
The JSA prohibits its professionals from playing computers in public without prior permission, with the reason of promoting shogi and monetizing the computer–human events.
[45]On October 12, 2010, after some 35 years of development, a computer finally beat a professional player, when the top ranked female champion Ichiyo Shimizu was beaten by the Akara2010 system in a game lasting just over 6 hours.
[46]On July 24, 2011, computer shogi programs Bonanza and Akara crushed the amateur team of Kosaku and Shinoda in two games. The allotted time for the amateurs was one hour and then three minutes per move. The allotted time for the computer was 25 minutes and then 10 seconds per move.
[47]On April 20, 2013, GPS Shogi defeated 8-dan professional shogi playerHiroyuki Miurain a 102-move game which lasted over 8 hours.
[48]On December 13, 2015, the highest rated player on Shogi Club 24 was computer program Ponanza, rated 3455.
[49]On April 10, 2016, Ponanza defeated Takayuki Yamasaki, 8-dan in 85 moves. Takayuki used 7 hours 9 minutes.
[50]In October 2017,DeepMindclaimed that its programAlphaZero, after a full nine hours of training, defeatedelmoin a 100-game match, winning 90, losing 8, and drawing two.
[51][52]From acomputational complexitypoint of view, generalized shogi isEXPTIME-complete.
[53]Video games[edit]Hundreds ofvideo gameswere released exclusively in Japan for severalconsoles.
Culture[edit]According to professional playerYoshiharu Habu, in Japan shogi is viewed as not merely a game as entertainment or a mind sport but is instead an art that is a part of traditional Japanese culture along withhaiku,tanka,noh,ikebana, and theJapanese tea ceremony. Its elevated status was established by theiemotosystem supported by the historicalshogunate.
[54][55]The backwardsuma(shogi horse symbol) is often featured on merchandise (such as on large decorative shogi piece sculptures, keychains, and other keepsakes) available for sale inTendō. It also serves as a symbol of good luck. (Cf.
Rabbit's foot.) There are multiple theories on its origin. One is thatuma(うま ) spelled in the Japanese syllabary backwards is まうmau(舞う), which means(to) danceand dancing horses are a good luck omen.
[56]The backwards 馬uma(左馬hidari uma)Ningen Shogi held in Himeji City with real people (2015)Tendō shogi museum (right) next toTendō Station(top)In popular culture[edit]In the manga and anime seriesNaruto, shogi plays an essential part inShikamaru Nara's character development. He often plays it with his sensei,Asuma Sarutobi, apparently always beating him. When Asuma is fatally injured in battle, he reminds Shikamaru that the shogi king must always be protected, and draws a parallel between the king in shogi and the children who would grow up to take care of the Hidden Leaf (Konoha) in the future, as well as his yet-unborn daughter, Mirai, whom he wanted Shikamaru to guide.
Shogi has been a central plot point in the manga and animeShion no Ō, the manga and animeMarch Comes in Like a Lion,[57]and the manga and television drama81diver.
In the manga and animeDurarara!!, the information broker Izaya Orihara plays a twisted version of chess, go and shogi, where he mixes all three games into one as a representation of the battles inIkebukuro.
In the video gamePersona 5, the Star confidant, a girl named Hifumi Togo, is a high school shogi player looking to break into the ranks of the professionals. The player character will gain knowledge stat when spending time with the confidant, supposedly from learning to play shogi. The abilities learned from ranking up the confidant comes from Japanese shogi terms.
