By delivering solutions automatically to the customers, an enterprise can essentially reduce their operating and training cost. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of an online help desk system based on conversational agent. Our system exploits the enabling technologies of artificial intelligence and natural language processing to offer an organization the ability to provide customer service much more economically and interactively than with traditional methods. The proposed system demonstrates a new form of e-service for an organization to increase their customer satisfaction and retention leading to competitive advantage over other organizations.
