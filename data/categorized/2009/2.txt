2009-05-06: Final class projects for Yann's undergraduate courseIntroduction to Roboticswere featured on a number of gadget and robot related blogs, particularlyslashgear, andRoboCommunity. Both blogs mention the final class project, which consisted ingetting Rovio robots to play soccer.

2009-04-19: Announcing the2009 ICML Workshop on Learning Feature Hierarchies. This workshop will take place on June 18, 2009 in Montreal, Canada, in conjunction with the 26th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2009). The organizers are: Kai Yu (NEC Labs-America), Ruslan Salakhutdinov (U. of Toronto), Yann LeCun (Courant Institute, NYU), Geoffrey Hinton (U. of Toronto) and Yoshua Bengio (U. of Montreal).
2009-04-15:Podcast of an interview with Yann LeCun: mp3 podcast available from theNew York Academy of Science website.
2009-04-10:New paper on feature learning available:Learning Invariant Features through Topographic Filter Maps, to appear in CVPR 2009. The method describes a method to learn SIFT-like locally-invariant feature detectors from data. The method minimizes a reconstruction criterion under a "block sparsity constraint", which minimizes the number of "pools" of features that are active. filters whose outputs are grouped in a pool end up detecting similar features, and the pool outputs can be interpreted as complex-cell like locally-invariant features.
2008-11-28:New papers on off-road mobile robot available:Learning Long-Range Vision for Autonomous Off-Road DrivingandA Multi-Range Architecture for Collision-Free Off-Road Robot Navigation. These two long paper will appear in the Journal of Field Robotics. They describe, in gory detail, the off-road mobile robot system we developed for theDARPA LAGR program.
2008-11-27:New paper on epilepsy seizure prediction available:Comparing SVM and Convolutional Networks for Epileptic Seizure Prediction from Intracranial EEG. The bottom line: our convolutional net-based system can predict epilepsy seizures one hour in advance for all patients in the plublicly available Freiburg dataset with no false alarm.
2008-10-19:Jeff Han on the Daily Show. Our friend and collaborator Jeff Han was on the Daily Show yesterday showing off his magic touch screen as part of a spoof conspiracy thriller involving John Oliver and CNN's John King. In case you missed it,here is the video.
2008-10-16:Old Courant Institute Reports at the Internet Archive. TheInternet Archivehas scanned thearchives of old tech reports the Courant Institute of Mathematical Science(our home institution) and put it up on their website. The best thing is that the Archive uses our own DjVu format to distribute the documents (among otherinferiorformats ;-). The collection includesseveral reports by The Man Himself: Richard Courant. The "DjVu" links on the archive website actually fires up a Java DjVu viewer (which is kind of slow), instad of calling your DjVu viewer or DjVu plug-in in your browser. The best is to click on the "http" link, and then click on the DjVu file. This project is funded by a grant from the Sloan foundation to the Archive.

The Computational and Biological Learning Lab at the Courant Institute was founded in September 2003. Our main research goal is to devise new methods, theories, and algorithms to derive knowledge from data: the process commonly known aslearning. Understanding learning is a necessary step toward building intelligent systems that can learn from experience. It may also give us a better understanding of the mechanisms that underly human and animal intelligence.
Over the last several years, Machine Learning methods have been applied with considerable success to such tasks as prediction, classification, detection, recognition, diagnosis, and to practically every areas of data modeling and decision making. Our interests at the CBLL include:"Deep" Learning, Unsupervised Learning: learning "deep" feature hierarchies: learning high-level internal representation of data from unlabeled examples.
Large-scale learning: the design of large-scale learning systems involving tens of thousands of input variables, and millions of training samples;Biological learning: Elucidating the neural mechanisms of learning in animals and humans. What is the learning algorithm of the cortex?Energy-Based Models: non-probabilistic graphical models without intractable partition functions.
Learning, perception, vision: visual perception is one of the most challenging domains for learning. We are developing learning systems for such tasks as thedetectionandrecognitionof objects in natural images.
Computational models of biological vision: what better way to understand biological vision systems than to build and artificial one?Mobile Robots: building trainable vision systems to makemobile robotsnavigate and avoid obstacles in rugged terrain.
Relational Graphical Models for Regression: we are building new types of relational graphical model for regression problems. The main application is predicting house prices.
End-to-end learning: using learning in every stages and components of a system, from raw inputs to ultimate output;Applications: we work on all applications of machine learning and pattern recognition: data mining, biological data analysis, mobile robotics, face detection/recognition, object recognition in images, document understanding...
Other topics:NEW!:Multi-Touch Interaction Panels (seeJeff Han's uber-kewl multi-touch panel).
Programming languages and prototyping environments for research (seeLush).
We are also interested in the following topics, but have no active projects in these areas at the moment:Digital Libraries: image compression, document understanding, electronic preservation and dissemination of Culture (seeDjVu).
Signal processing, image processing, data compression (seeDjVu).
Information theory, and the physical foundations of computing.
