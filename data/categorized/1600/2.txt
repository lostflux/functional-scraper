The Asus ROG Zephyrus G15 and G14 particularly stud out as high-powered yet portable gaming titans. TheAsus ROG Zephyrus M16 (from £1,499)smartly builds on the G15 by adding a slim bezel, 16:10 display and a stealthy black look.

This 13-inch laptop is slim and light yet is powerful enough to deal with a heavy workload. There are numerous configuration options, including non-glare screens, Full HD or UHD and touchscreen versions. The tiny screen bezel means it has a very small footprint, making it easy to fit in any bag.

With five cleaning modes, four brush heads and three intensity settings thePhilips Sonicare Smart 9500 (£250)is highly customisable and aside from the superb clean you'll get, the battery life of 14 days is handy and we're fans of the glass charging stand and travel case too.

The user experience is smooth and stable, there's a wide product range, including subs and amps, together with AirPlay 2 and Spotify Connect etc (though no hi-res audio) and an up-and-at-'em sound. If you need somewhere to start we'd recommend the voice controlled and good value Sonos One.

With three power levels, it offers the same performance, in terms of suction, as a full-size vacuum. It's great for stairs and with two floorheads, four additional tools and auto detection, the Dyson handles edge to edge cleaning like a champ.
