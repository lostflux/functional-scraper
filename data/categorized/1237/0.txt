New PyTorch & Weight Streaming FeaturesCerebras Wins Best Places to Work in the Bay Area AwardCerebras CS-2 System Awarded ‘Best in Show’ at Bio-IT World Conference & ExpoTotalEnergies and Cerebras: Accelerating into a Multi-Energy Future (Updated)GlaxoSmithKline and Cerebras are Advancing the State of the Art in AI for Drug DiscoveryWhat our customers are sayingGlaxoSmithKline"Last year we generated more data in three months than in our entire 300-year history. With the Cerebras CS-1, we have been able to increase the complexity of the encoder models that we can generate, while decreasing their training time by 80x."Kim BransonSVP Global Head of AI and MLGlaxoSmithKlineAstraZeneca"Training which historically took over 2 weeks to run on a large cluster of GPUs was accomplished in just over 2 days — 52hrs to be exact — on a single CS-1. This could allow us to iterate more frequently and get much more accurate answers, orders of magnitude faster."Nick BrownHead of AI & Data ScienceAstrazenecaTotalEnergies"TotalEnergies’ roadmap is crystal clear: more energy, less emissions. To achieve this, we need to combine our strengths with those who enable us to go faster, higher, and stronger… We count on the CS-2 system to boost our multi-energy research and give our research ‘athletes’ that extra competitive advantage."Vincent SaubestreCEO & PresidentTotalEnergies Research & Technology USAArgonne Nation Laboratory"Cerebras allowed us to reduce the experiment turnaround time on our cancer prediction models by 300x, ultimately enabling us to explore questions that previously would have taken years, in mere months."Dr. Rick StevensAssociate Laboratory Director of Computing, Environment and Life SciencesArgonne National LaboratoryLawrence Livermore National Laboratory"Integrating Cerebras technology into the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory supercompute infrastructure enabled us to build a truly unique compute pipeline with massive computation, storage, and thanks to the Wafer Scale Engine, dedicated AI processing."Bronis de SupinksiCTO, Livermore ComputingLawrence Livermore National LaboratoryPittsburgh Supercomputing Center"With the Cerebras Technology, we see a machine that is specifically designed for AI and for the potential optimizations in deep learning."Dr. Paola BuitragoDirector of AI and Big DataPSCOur unique technologyCS-2 SystemPurpose built for AI and HPC, the CS-2 replaces an entire cluster of GPUs. Gone are the challenges of parallel programming, distributed training, and cluster management.
Wafer-Scale EngineThe revolutionary central processor for our deep learning computer system is the largest computer chip ever built and the fastest AI processor on Earth.
Software PlatformThe Cerebras Software Platform integrates with the popular machine learning frameworks TensorFlow and PyTorch, so researchers can effortlessly bring their models to the CS-2 system.
Flexible ConsumptionOn or off-premises, Cerebras Cloud meshes with your current cloud-based workflow to create a secure, multi-cloud solution.
