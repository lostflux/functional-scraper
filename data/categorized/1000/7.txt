Six New DeepMind scholarships at Makerere UniversityDeepMind supports the establishment of master’s scholarships to study artificial intelligence at Makerere University.
Makerere University and DeepMind are excited to announce six (6) new Master’s scholarships in the field of Machine Learning for the academic year 2022/2023. The scholarships will support students who wish to studyMSc. Computer Scienceprogramme (Track: AI and Data Science) taught in the Department of Computer Science at Makerere University. The new scholarships are part of the renewed collaboration that started in 2021/22 where four scholarships were awarded. The scholarships will be open to students from Uganda, other East African countries, or International students from a Sub-Saharan African country. The scholarship package will include full financial support for tuition, stipend, equipment, AI conference participation and mentorship. International students will also be eligible for a relocation grant to move to Makerere to begin their studies.
Makerere University will join other leading universities in partnering with DeepMind to offer scholarships, including Stellenbosch University in South Africa and international partners, such as the Universities of Cambridge and Oxford, University College London and Imperial College in London.
