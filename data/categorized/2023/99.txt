Construction Projects underway Tokamak Complex Last pour for Tritium Building The last significant concrete pour, on Thursday 12 October, was to create a 60-centimetre-thick slab for the aedicula sitting on top of the Trititum Building. The seven-storey building is now completely framed out, from B2 basement level to Level 5 and roof structures.
12 October 2023 Download Painting inside the Tritium Building Paint work is progressing inside the Tritium Building (pictured: the vault annex at level L4). This vast space (40,000 cubic metres) will accommodate equipment for the tokamak cooling water and tritium breeding systems.
12 October 2023 Download Tritum Building: end of civil works Civil works on the seven-storey concrete Tritium Building are nearly complete and the tall cranes will soon be dismantled. Teams are working on the last level, L5, to complete all kinds of finishing works, including waterproofing.

29 August 2023 Download Under the Tokamak Complex Underneath the concrete slab that supports the Tokamak Complex is a vast, dimly lit space whose only features are squat, pillar-like structures called "plinths." Sandwiched between the top of the pillars and the slab above, flexible seismic pads ensure that in the event of an earthquake, the integrity of the building will be protected from sudden and strong horizontal accelerations.
01 June 2023 Download Best view One of the best views of the Tokamak Complex and the ITER Assembly Hall is from the belvedere of the Visitors Centre.
01 April 2023 Download January 2023 The Tritium Building (concrete structure, left) is now at height. To the right, the structural beams of the High Voltage Building for neutral beam power supply are in place.
20 January 2023 Download Tritium Building: nearly there We can expect a topping-out ceremony for the Tritium Building in 2023, as the last level is completed. (This tradition originating from Eastern Europe consists of placing a small tree atop a completed construction project.) 06 December 2022 Download Progress on the Tritium Building European contractors are currently pouring concrete at level 5 (L5) of the Tritium Building. This will bring the structure to full height.

06 July 2022 Download Management walkthrough For a comprehensive overview of issues and progress on the worksite, senior management does a monthly "walkthrough" of all buildings. It's about keeping in touch with challenges, progress on challenges, and also the day-to-day determination of the teams.
06 July 2022 Download The importance of work performed today "It is important to properly plan and execute the commissioning of systems, of course. But also, the ability to achieve the project's objectives depends vitally on the quality of the workmanship and the decisions made in the course of the present phase."

Â© Les Nouveaux MÃ©dias/SNC ENGAGE 15 May 2020 Download Covers off One of the last things to do at the bottom of the Tokamak pitâ€”uncover the cryostat bearings, which until now had been hidden under thick protective wrapping.
13 May 2020 Download Match exactly The pedestal of the cryostat base will be affixed to the female lugs seen here in the wall of the bioshield (steel rectangles). To meet these interfacing pieces, the base must be positioned as it is lowered with a tolerance of +/-5 mm.
13 May 2020 Download 18 cryostat bearings A set of 18 spherical bearings, evenly spaced and deeply anchored into the "crown," will bear the full weight of the machine and, acting as ball-and-socket joints, will enable the smooth transfer of horizontal and rotational forces.
13 May 2020 Download 30 metres deep Two sets of overhead cranes (2 x 750 tonnes and 2 x 50 tonnes) will be responsible for the ballet of activity as components ready for installation are picked up in the Assembly Hall and brought to the 30-metre deep Tokamak pit. Photo: GÃ©rard LesÃ©nÃ©chal 06 May 2020 Download On the pit floor Painted and cleaned, everything is nearly ready in the Tokamak pit for the first machine components.

02 April 2020 Download Final crane path tests Totalling approximately 1,000 tonnes, these loads are travelling the way of future ITER components, and permitting the European Domestic Agency to validate ITER Council milestone #50, for crane access in the newly completed Tokamak Building.
28 March 2020 Download A delicate threshold The loads are about to cross from the Assembly Hall into the Tokamak Building. The cranes will halt at the threshold to allow the loads to be moved back and forth along the crane's yellow beams to monitor the deflection of the crane runway and that of the crane hall pillars.
28 March 2020 Download Coming next Part of the circular lid that closes the assembly pit has already been taken down, allowing a dizzying view into the 30-metre-deep concrete cylinder. The removal of the 11 segments that make up the lid is scheduled to begin on Thursday 2 April and last through the end of the work week.
28 March 2020 Download Carefully supervising The load path operation was overseen by Roberto Lanza (left, ITER Responsible Officer for cranes and crane operations) and Duco Jensen (ITER site planning coordinator), with strong support from construction coordinator StÃ©phane Herpin. The operation involved personnel from the Buildings Infrastructure & Power Supplies (BIPS) Project Team; Fusion for Energy contractors VFR (Vinci, Ferrovial, Razel-Bec), REEL (cranes), Dalkia, GDES, Martifer (manufacturing and installation of the crane hall), SAMT, and Nuvia; and contractors supporting both the ITER Organization and Fusion for Energy (Engage, APAVE, Energhia, Tiresia, and MOMENTUM).
