CILVR Lab About The CILVR Lab (Computational Intelligence, Learning, Vision, and Robotics) regroups faculty members, research scientists, postdocs, and students working on AI, machine learning, and a wide variety of applications, notably computer perception, natural language understanding , robotics, and healthcare.
Faculty Members Sam Bowman Joan Bruna Kyunghyun Cho Sumit Chopra Rob Fergus He He Brenden Lake Yann LeCun ( ACM Turing Award 2018 ) Michael Picheny Lerrel Pinto Rajesh Ranganath Andrew Gordon Wilson Affiliated Faculty Members Leon Bottou Kyle Cranmer Krzysztof Geras Keith Ross Jason Weston Gus Xia Zheng Zhang MaD & MaD+ About The Math and Data group is part of New York University’s Center for Data Science , and the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences.
Its mission is to advance the Mathematical and Statistical foundations of Data Sciences, specializing in Signal processing and Inverse Problems, Machine Learning and Deep Learning, and High-dimensional statistics and Probability.
Faculty Joan Bruna Carlos Fernandez-Granda Julia Kempe Jonathan Niles-Weed Affiliated Faculty Gerard Ben Arous Xi Chen Sinan Gunturk Eyal Lubetzky Adi Rangan Eero Simoncelli Esteban Tabak Eric Vanden-Eijnden Minds and Machines About Minds and Machines at CDS sits at the interface of data science and cognitive science. One aim of our work is to use progress in machine intelligence to advance our understanding of human intelligence. Although modern AI systems are not necessarily intended as cognitive models, they open new ways of studying longstanding questions about the kinds of experience and priors that are needed to develop human-like abilities from perceptual experiences. In the other direction, insights from human intelligence can spur innovation in machine intelligence, and provide yardsticks for evaluating the success of machine learning systems. CDS is a hub for research of this kind, and benefits from collaborations with the broader CILVR AI lab and the broader computational cognitive science community at NYU, as well as with external partners.
Faculty Sam Bowman Todd Gureckis Brenden Lake Tal Linzen Cristina Savin Eero Simoncelli Faculty Fellows Najoung Kim Angela Radulescu Elena Sizikova ML 2 About The Machine Learning for Language (ML²) group is a team of researchers at New York University working on developing and studying state-of-the-art machine learning methods for natural language processing (NLP). ML² is affiliated with the larger CILVR lab.
Faculty Sam Bowman Kyunghyun Cho He He Tal Linzen João Sedoc STAT About The STAT group (Statistics: Tools, Algorithms, and Theory) seeks to advance the state-of-the-art in statistics, by developing new methodological, computational, and mathematical approaches to statistical problems and to their applications in data science and machine learning. The STAT group assembles faculty, fellows and students across CDS and the Courant Institute.
