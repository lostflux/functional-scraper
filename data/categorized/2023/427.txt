Scanwatch The ScanWatch’s traditional clock face hides some of the most advanced tech we’ve seen in a smartwatch yet.
Scanwatch Heart health monitoring Proactive heart tracking.
Invaluable peace of mind.
Proactive heart rate tracking Day & night heart rate ECG Normal ScanWatch automatically records your heart rate, day and night. And at any time, in 30 seconds, an ECG reading is ready whenever you want. A report can be easily shared with a doctor via the Withings app.
Back PROACTIVE HEART HEALTH MONITORING ScanWatch tracks heart rate every second during workouts to optimize training, and monitors daily and overnight heart rate to help improve health over time.
ScanWatch can record a clinically validated electrocardiogram and detect signs of atrial fibrillation—a form of arrhythmia that can be damaging to your health if left undiagnosed. ECG readings can be easily shared with your doctor via the Withings app, providing valuable information to help them track your heart health.
Note: ECG must be used under the care of a physician. ECG requires a free in-app activation process. ECG is not intended for use by people under 22 years old. Prescription Use Only.
How to record an ECG To record an ECG, sit and rest, press the digital crown, scroll in the menu to find the ECG option, press again, then place your fingers on the front electrode for 30 seconds.
Your smartphone can display the live signal during the record, and will keep all measurements to view and share at any time.
How it works ScanWatch is equipped with three electrodes: two are on the back of the case and the other is the metal ring around the watchface.
When you place your finger on the ring, it closes a loop that allows the watch to measure your heart's electrical activity. This method is called a one-lead electrocardiogram.
Why it matters An ECG is a way to detect atrial fibrillation (AFib), a prevalent heart arrhythmia. It can be a serious condition that can go undiagnosed because it can show no symptoms and/or not be present during doctor’s visits because the episodes can be intermittent.
Wellness Respiratory monitoring A clinically validated oximeter on your wrist.
Oxygen saturation level Breathing disturbances monitoring ScanWatch uses a clinically validated SpO2 sensor featuring exclusive multi-wavelength technology, so you can record blood oxygen levels from your wrist in only 30 seconds.
Also, monitor breathing disturbances during sleep to better understand sleep quality for overall wellness.
Back Clinically validated Oxygen Saturation (SPO2) SpO2 provides a measurement of the hemoglobin, red blood cells carrying oxygen, in a person’s blood. Known as blood oxygen saturation, it is used for rapid assessment and monitoring of a person’s respiratory function.
How ScanWatch measures SpO2 ScanWatch uses a multi-wavelength sensor called PPG (photoplethysmography) sensor that emits and measures red and infrared reflections on the blood vessels in the wrist. An SpO2 value is represented by a percentage. Normal SpO2 values vary between 90 and 100%.
Each SpO2 measurement can easily be found in the Health Mate app and can be shared via the Health Report PDF.
Oxygen saturation Normal Breathing disturbances Low Sleep analysis Lie down, breathe, dream.
ScanWatch computes numerous data points to measure sleep cycles, monitor breathing disturbances and then calculates your overall Sleep Score—automatically.
Back Sleep tracking helps you understand your night and make choices that can improve them, such as changing daily activity. Our proprietary AI has been calibrated with a sleep laboratory in Manheim, Germany and with Beclere Hospital in France, using polysomnography, considered to be the gold standard for sleep analysis.
Sleep Cycles ScanWatch tracks your sleep cycles (light and deep), duration of sleep, time to be asleep and wake up as well as interruptions, and logs it in the Withings app so you can view your trends to help manage your sleep quality.
Withings app view 11:49PM 7:45AM 7h54 Awake Light Deep Sleep Score Our exclusive algorithm automatically scores your night based on sleep cycles, duration, regularity and interruptions.
Withings app view 75 Duration 7h54 Recovery Good Interruptions 1 time Regularity Poor Overnight breathing disturbances In addition to analyzing sleep, activating the Respiratory Wellness Scan can monitor breathing disturbances via the PPG sensor, and the accelerometer.
Sleep heart rate Periodic measurements of your heart rate at night will help you understand your Sleep Heart Rate, the average heart rate during sleep. It differs from Resting Heart Rate which is a single measurement, usually taken just after waking up.
Smart Wake-up Because ScanWatch knows if you are in a light or deep stage, it can choose the best time to wake you up according to your schedule. You simply set a wake-up time in the app, and ScanWatch will wake you with a light vibration.
Withings app view 7:00AM 8:00AM 20 min 7:45AM Sleep score Sleep cycle Night heart rate Overnight spO2 smart wake-up Activity tracking Meet your fitness goals.

Fitness level ScanWatch assesses your Fitness Level when you run or walk based on the maximal oxygen consumption (VO2 Max) estimation.
VO2 max is defined as the maximum amount of oxygen an individual consumes over one minute during intense physical effort. The more oxygen consumed, the harder muscles can work, and therefore the higher the VO2 max level.

September 25, 2023 | jonny I find this watch very aesthetic I own several products from Withings and they work well together.
September 24, 2023 | Gabriela Meine Scan Watch With other devices from Scan Watch September 23, 2023 | Heinz Beautiful watch It is a traditional watch filled with technology! September 23, 2023 | Dd Fitness watch in classic style This watch is useful and chic in equal parts. It monitors heart and circulatory functions, and displays time with an alarm clock and stopwatch without looking too technical. Smartphone notifications are also signaled, centralizing the most important things. In particular, the really long battery life with a single charge should be mentioned.
September 17, 2023 | JoLie Health I do like the way it tracks my health September 16, 2023 | Sorin Versatile and reliable watch Practical and easy to use September 15, 2023 | Mlb Top watch I was looking for a discreet and lightweight watch. But above all reliable and easy to use. With Withings I found my watch.
September 15, 2023 | Karine Solid. Discreet and full of sensors I love the watch. It is hi-tech while looking like a classic watch September 14, 2023 | Duff thoughts on Withings scanwatch Withings scanwatch looks like a classic watch, and therefore looks great whatever you are wearing whilst providing multi health measures : steps, sleep quality, workout tracking, and alerts about your heart. I have previously had other models of Withings watches, and also use their scales.
September 14, 2023 | jillg reliability daily tracking on the app.
September 13, 2023 | papousvt heart rate measurement Does not work properly in automatic mode September 11, 2023 | JPL15 Health Everything it offers, ecg, sp02, steps, sleep....
September 11, 2023 | Popeye what, for me, is missing I find that measuring blood pressure is missing, which is very important to me September 11, 2023 | durruti Excellent connected watch I have been using Withings watches for almost 5 years. The scanwatch is my 3rd watch and I love it. Being a sportsperson over 50, I find the watch to be an excellent training companion. I also bought a body+ scale and a blood-pressure monitor from Withings. The combination of these products offers me an ideal health tracking. I recommend Withings products to everyone.
September 10, 2023 | Nicolas An elegant sports watch I use all the functions that this watch offers.
September 9, 2023 | Alexander Intelligence and health Effective product, very good monitoring of my health September 7, 2023 | Sou su Readability and accuracy Significant autonomy and ease of use September 4, 2023 | Helde Comprehensive Monitoring Many features to stay healthy September 4, 2023 | Wolfgang A beautiful watch that can do a lot The versatile usability September 3, 2023 | Hoefo Good watch, great battery life It looks good, water proof, measures steps and sleep. I like the smaller hand showing percentage of target steps reminding if I'm behind. It could do better with pulse and other features. I really hope Withings will bring back the timeline feature for the app.
September 2, 2023 | Sammy Stylish Hybrid Wrist Watch It's a great watch, not a lumbering black block, the display is very adequate, the health monitoring, when linked to the lovely app is just right for the keeping an eye on your vitals.
September 1, 2023 | Martinf Best connected health watch Stylish and efficient. I use it with bpm core, body comp, and sleep analyzer August 31, 2023 | Hippo Smart and easy to use - good battery Simpel and elegant watch with long battery August 30, 2023 | Frederik A watch that goes to the essentials On the wrist day and night for 3 years, a good all-terrain companion.
August 30, 2023 | Fredm13 Exceeds my expectations It is part of a suite of products (sleep, BodyCardio, Thermo, BPM Core...) coordinated by the Withings app to guide me in my health management goals.
August 29, 2023 | Hadji All day health monitoring Simple to operate, advanced technology...
August 28, 2023 | ChiGene Ok Battery life August 27, 2023 | Tina well rounded device in a beautiful package I like how beautiful the watch looks; it gets so many compliments, then people are surprised when they find out it's a hybrid watch. I love the battery life, the health measurements, and metrics it provides, the sleep tracking. The heart rate monitor and activity tracker are great for general progress and health monitoring The step counter is a bit conservative, and I wish certain activities were tracked in more detail like for example how many floors were climbed when tracking climbing activity. Overall, it's an excellent product and definitely the best of both worlds August 26, 2023 | Steven Ease of Use I use the scan watch in conjunction with the body pro scale and blood pressure monitor.
August 24, 2023 | Cheryl The only watch you’ll want to wear.
A good looking timepiece. A watch that notifies you of calls and emails when linked to your phone and it helps as a useful reminder of things you need to do and keep track of. It also gives you a gentle nudge to get up and get moving, it can be used as a stop watch when exercising. The list is endless, oh and most importantly it tells the time accurately.
August 23, 2023 | Stephanie Lawrence How fitness level is determined.
I really like it, as it is motivating for my everyday life. I move more and I use it together with the scale.
August 23, 2023 | Sandra E.
Rating That it is a disguised smartwatch that looks very good. The Body plus scale August 22, 2023 | Klaus Functional and Style 1a The first thing that caught my attention was the design and it impressed me. The watch is very easy to use and works very well together with the blood pressure monitor through the mobile phone.
August 20, 2023 | Martina The kind of smartwatch that you ACTUALLY need Scanwatch has all the functionality, style and tracking that you need on a daily basis, without the hassle of having to charge everyday or wondering whether it fits your outfit, or even the distraction of another screen screaming for your attention.
August 16, 2023 | Arturo Recharge it once a month Track your steps, weight, and sleep and share with others..yes, scale and blood pressure August 15, 2023 | Pati Very satisfied Tracking physical activity is very useful in everyday life. I also use a connected scale from Withings August 14, 2023 | idls The steps Monitoring the number of steps August 14, 2023 | MD Precise, efficient and discreet A valuable help in everyday life, especially at night. The Scanwatch allows you to analyze, reassure yourself or take into account to modify certain behaviors.
August 13, 2023 | paulborges Watered down Doesn’t work well with Withings Sleep August 13, 2023 | ER Great watch Heart monitoring August 13, 2023 | Josch bekommen wie versprochen I actually like everything about the Scanwatch. I was looking for a smartwatch with a longer battery life than 18 hours or 1.5 days. After reading and considering information for about 2 weeks, I bought this watch almost 3 years ago. It hardly measures phantom steps, can do all the promised functions, and works like the first day. The application is clear and comprehensive in its analysis. Meanwhile, a scale and blood pressure monitor have also been added. I now refrain from receiving notifications from other programs such as incoming calls or messages, it makes life calmer.
August 13, 2023 | Holger Very good technology with good appearance Together with Thermo and Scale August 12, 2023 | Mia Key points at a glance with Chic Stay focused on easily interpretable health data August 10, 2023 | pelu Top I like that I have everything in view, I have the watch (Steel HR) and the matching scale (Body Comp) and I am very satisfied with it August 10, 2023 | Trine nul 14 months already broken wheel content then breakdown August 9, 2023 | gegelaposte Discretion, precision, and autonomy Monitoring activity, heart, and sleep. Plus discreet smartphone notifications August 6, 2023 | CARON She makes herself forgotten It's not a second phone on the wrist, she remains discreet, and cares about health August 6, 2023 | Nalex Great watch with great features Has everything I wanted in a watch without looking like a toy.
August 5, 2023 | Scott Great watch I love my Scanwatch, it's stylish and has a long battery life. I use other Withings products as well, they're all great, but the mobile app is getting worse and less user-friendly with each update and it really spoils my experience with the physical products.
August 5, 2023 | Palma Interesting! It provides motivation, it is clear and preventive.
August 4, 2023 | Silli Relevant data for health monitoring Combination of devices is helpful August 4, 2023 | Capucho Stylish design, great technology Stylish design and sophisticated technology, helps me improve my sleep and keep track of my workouts.
August 3, 2023 | Dani Beautiful, practical with unfortunately disruptions Beautiful watch, great battery life, unfortunately nothing works since the update. Not enough support for disruptions.
August 3, 2023 | CPB The pop did less, but better Beautiful product, which does more than my previous pop, but struggles to recognize activities. For example, it often recognizes cycling even though I haven't been on a bike for years. The pop easily recognized swimming. The ScanWatch requires me to declare swimming before jumping into the pool... But that's probably because I don't know how to use it :-D August 2, 2023 | Toto Always informed I am always informed about my personal data and know what I can work on. I still use the sleep tracker to control my breathing pauses. The watch gives me security and I know from the health report when I need to consult my doctor. I am also very happy that the watch has a NORMAL dial. And I receive important messages on the watch at the same time.
August 2, 2023 | Anne B Great upgrade from my Steel HR I've had my beloved Steel HR for years. There's really no complaint about it. It is lightweight with an elegant design and the battery last really long time. I was skeptical about how much the Scan Watch can be better than the Steel HR. I was wrong. The Steel HR was good but the Scan Watch is much better in almost every way. I like the size is slightly larger. The UI is nicer. The ECG and SPO2 monitor functions are the main reasons I upgraded and I'm not disappointed.
August 2, 2023 | JWalk Beautiful functional watch Many good features with long battery life August 1, 2023 | Ralf AVIS USEFUL July 29, 2023 | CLOL Mes withings I use the scanwatch, the scale, the blood-pressure monitor and the sleep analyzer. The sleep data should be better associated with the sleep analyzer (for example, different sleep duration). The heart rate data during running is always inaccurate. Swimming: it is not possible to set the intervals (vibration every 10 minutes instead of 30). Swimming distance not recognized (the pool size should be entered) July 29, 2023 | Laurent34 Excellent watch excellent tracking of my physical fitness July 28, 2023 | camille53 Superb watch.
This watch has all the beauty of a classic analog watch. The phosphorescent hands add an effect and are useful at night. And discreetly, it is connected and displays your notifications. I have not yet used all the sports and health tracking features.
July 28, 2023 | Frédéric Lifelong companion Scale, blood pressure monitor, and watch are the ideal combination for health and fitness July 27, 2023 | Leonardo Ideal for sports tracking Ease of use Useful every day for my sports sessions. Good heart monitoring It never leaves me! July 26, 2023 | Klody Withings is innovation on the wrist A watch with many useful functions packaged in timeless elegance July 25, 2023 | Gerd Görlich Durability of the watch The smartwatch has provided good service for exactly 2 years and 9 months. Then the crown (sensor) for operating the EKG, etc. stopped working.
July 25, 2023 | Ei Ru Impressive! I have had this watch for 2 or 3 years and I am particularly impressed with its quality... The tracking aspect is very good, although I would put a caveat on the heart rate tracking during an activity (it tends to lose track a bit with movements, even when tightly strapped to the wrist). As for the dial, I tinker regularly and it sometimes takes a few hits. Despite that, there is still not a single scratch on the glass...😄 So for me, excellent value for money.
July 24, 2023 | Morpheus Weight With the scale July 24, 2023 | Maryse Schmuck, function and innovation in one! With the analog dial, the time is always in view from any position and in any brightness. Reliable information and appointments from the smartphone on the wrist. Automatic tracking of the cardiovascular system in the background without any major settings. I use the blood pressure monitor, the scale, the sleep analyzer, and the watch.
July 23, 2023 | Roman Better than the typical smartwatch I really like that it doesn't look like a typical smartwatch. This means that I can wear it working out, working in the yard, relaxing, running errands, and when I am dressed nicely. The watch band is super simple to change out. A huge added bonus is that the battery usually lasts me 3-4 weeks before I have to charge my watch.
July 22, 2023 | Tabatha Ideal for monitoring vital signs I wear the watch constantly and use it together with a Withings blood pressure monitor. This way, as a cardiology patient, I have constant control over heart rate and blood pressure.
July 22, 2023 | Michael Easy to use and good battery life Great battery life compared to other products I have seen and easy the use to track my exercise in the gym or cycling on the roads July 21, 2023 | Steve You need a bp monior or smart scale to get al It holds its charge, you need the bp.monitor or smart scale to getbthe ecg.
July 21, 2023 | Ad Fantastic, until it stopped being waterproof Fair design and functionalities while still being an elegant watch July 20, 2023 | Pedro Good overall package The software is simple and well thought out.
July 20, 2023 | Dennis Long battery life The wristband is long enough, the long battery life is great, the recordings while running, jogging or cycling - flawless July 18, 2023 | Stein Simple is key The good thing is that I can still focus and are not disturbed all the time July 17, 2023 | Marcel Planned obsolescence Bag: non-existent... despite major issues July 17, 2023 | Ile An excellent blend of analog and digital The battery life is great, and use of standard watch bands allows for infinite possibilities (I use a Leatherman Tread). Notifications are also subtle, allowing for per-app selection instead of a deluge of notifications.
July 15, 2023 | Jeff Solid fitness watch for everyday use I use the Scanwatch as a pedometer and to record my jogging routes. It is very convenient for me that this watch has such a long battery life.

The 'Body Comp+' scale completes the health overview and encourages improvements! July 13, 2023 | Peter Great Window to your health I fully enjoy Withings scan watch because of the classical watch face with a discreet screen for notifications. I do not like most trackers because they can be intrusive. This watch is fully customizable to only let you know what's important to you. The screen is a little dated for 2023 and Withings should really consider a full ink display like some Fossil hybrid watches. The app is great though and very detailed for health. Pair your app and watch with a full e-ink display and you would have a real winner.

Can't wait to see what watches will be able to do in the next 10 years June 20, 2023 | anonymous Great looks plus fitness tracking This watch looks like a normal watch, not square or chunky, and it always gets compliments on it's appearance.

First of all I love the way this watch looks. It’s very professional looking and doesn’t look bulky or cheap by any means. Secondly, I’m not a major workout person so the simplicity of this watch works perfect for me. I don’t care about a bunch of bells and whistles when it comes to workouts and the fact that this watch doesn’t wake me up in the middle of the night to itch my wrist and then have a bright scan light in my eyes from doing so is also a plus. It’s so comfortable. I just love it! This is the best watch I’ve ever owned.

Mine developed fogging and I was not able to get it replaced because my version of the ScanWatch was purchased before the warranty term was increased to 2 years. The screen is now broken, too, but the watch is only 3 years old. I had expected a better quality or a way to replace the device within warranty if it is clearly a failing device that was not mishandled. I take good care of my watch, but it is still dying. Sensors still work, but the watch itself is failing. Very sad.

I stumbled upon the models from Withings by chance and find the combination of a classic watch with a smartwatch function very positive. When unpacking, the hopes of an visually appealing and well-made watch were confirmed. Although it is not very slim, it fits well on the wrist. The setup via the app works very well. However, I had problems with the pulse function. I just couldn't get it to work. The ECG function, on the other hand, worked well for me. What bothered me was the very weak vibration alarm and the lack of continuous pulse detection. I had not understood this from the descriptions of the watch and unfortunately it was one of the main reasons for me to decide against the watch, as I should keep an eye on it due to current heart problems. Otherwise, a great watch, if you overlook the bracelet, which can be easily exchanged for a better version.

June 5, 2023 | anonymous Long battery life Lightweight and comfortable wristband June 4, 2023 | Beat Lots of great features, great quality, but sleep recording is inaccurate.
I love a lot of the features of this watch. However, the sleep recording, which is one of the biggest reasons I got it, is severely inaccurate. With my bad insomnia, I know I lay awake for hours during the night, but it doesn't record me as 'awake' unless I actually get up and move. Even if I'm tossing and turning and clicking the watch to see what time it is, it still records 'light sleep'. At least the monitor of my heart rate has been a good indicator of whether I'm actually sleeping or not, but I shouldn't have to use alternative data.

Long battery life, ECG and pulse work, although pulse takes a long time to stabilize. Route recording is unfortunately poor, but I have not been able to perform the proposed troubleshooting yet. What is annoying is that when moving the wrist or when putting on a sleeve, the button is too easy to press and the watch starts measuring or goes into some menu items. Maybe you should wear it on your right arm or move/secure the button.

May 21, 2023 | Ysatiss Good, but order from Witting for the smaller version I had to return it since Amazon only sells the large version and I wanted the smaller version, so I had to order directly from Witting. Great battery life, it gives me at least 25 days in one charge. It’s not perfect and alot more limited compared to Apple watch or another smart watch, but in my case it was good enough for what I wanted to track.

May 16, 2023 | Lasse N Cool Long battery life May 16, 2023 | Ve Elegant everyday helper Slowly but surely, smartwatches are encountered everywhere. They immediately catch the eye with their distinctive design. It's different with this one. It can also be worn as an elegant accessory with a suit. However, compromises must be made with the health functions. Those who come from an Apple Watch will quickly be annoyed by the long measurements of ECG and O2 (the watch must be pressed against the wrist for 30 seconds for both). Those who don't necessarily need this function have a nice watch with the ability to display short information. However, reading longer messages is not really possible, as the display is simply too small and the scrolling text takes too long.

May 13, 2023 | Wundertnix No scratches (yet), better screen + design After my Steel HR broke, i knew i wanted to try the ScanWatch. While the new sensors are not super useful to me right now, thankfully don't need regular readings of O2 or ECG, they are very nice to have and i am always curious to see what it looks like at various intervals. What I really like are the new sapphire glass, which seems very scratch resistant, the larger watch face and screen. The crown is also quite handsome although it's easy to press accidentally.
May 13, 2023 | Ang All measurement data is correct I bought the watch because of the EKG function. The measurement works perfectly. The Android APP is very comprehensive and easy to understand. Sleep, oxygen, breathing, and pulse are automatically monitored when set up. I am very satisfied with it and have a way to monitor my vital functions. My doctor likes this too. In addition, the steps and climbed floors per day are recorded and evaluated. The only drawback is that the dial is not fluorescent, only the hands. But that's only a small drawback May 13, 2023 | anonymous Very good hybrid health watch Configurable for personal needs.

Easy to evaluate via the app. Two points deduction, as my skin reacts allergically to the watch and the number of climbed stairs is usually displayed completely wrong.

I haven't worn a watch for a long time and I've never had a smartwatch before. The weight of the watch was a bit unusual at first and a bit higher than the watches I've worn so far, but you get used to it quickly. The operation of the functions is very easy and intuitive, almost self-explanatory. The battery life is sensational, I charged the watch once after purchase and will get about 3 weeks out of it. It would certainly be more days if I didn't use the functions for tracking sports events more often. These feel like they're draining the battery well. In general, the additional functions such as ECG, sleep tracking are top-notch! The results are understandable and correspond to what one perceives oneself. All in all, a really good product! I don't want to miss the watch anymore.

LG H.R April 23, 2023 | anonymous Very good watch The watch is class with all its functions and design, however, the price is a bit high in my opinion :) April 22, 2023 | anonymous Accurate info about heart/respiratory health The ScanWatch provides information about my heart and respiratory health while exercising and at rest. Easy access to its ECG feature can let me know if I'm suffering from a dangerous arrhythmia, and its constant monitoring of my heart and breathing lets me know how I've performed after a run, a ride, or any other activity as well as when I am asleep. Coupled with the Withings BP cuff and their smart scale, I have a better understanding of my health on a daily basis. And all of my data is easy to access in the HealthMate App, showing my overall trends and where I am relative to my goals for greater health.

April 15, 2023 | Neya The smartest smartwatch Having been a long-time Steel HR Sport watch user since it’s launch, I decided to upgrade to the Scanwatch primarily for the improved display and ECG capabilities, but I’ve been so impressed with so much more than just those two enhancements. The overall design is so classic and sleek, and as a result it works even better as a watch for all occasions. Paired with the even tougher, scratch-resistant glass, I know I don’t need to worry about it if I’m doing something more physical/hands-on whilst it’s on my wrist. The battery life seems to be even better than the Steel HR Sport, with it lasting a whole month even with daily ECG’s. Finally, the improvement which took me by surprise for how much more useful the watch is than its predecessor, is the fully functioning crown. Now that it’s possible to scroll through notifications (forward and back) by turning the crown, and also navigating and controlling the many features on the watch via the crown, it feels like it augments daily life much more - Reducing the need to use my phone. Combined with the Body Cardio scale and the Thermo device, and I’ve got myself a pretty impressive health monitoring ecosystem, which all seamlessly combines within the ‘Withings’ app, building a truly informative picture of my lifestyle and physical condition.

April 14, 2023 | Sk A great alternative After a few years with the Apple Watch, I was looking for a visually more discreet option with better battery life. Very quickly, the only alternative with these attributes that came up was the Withings Scanwatch. Now, it must be said fairly, I always had the latest model from Apple. So the comparison object is really at a very high level! Nevertheless, I do not regret the purchase. The price is absolutely fair! The workmanship is great, the design is discreet and timeless. The smartwatch functions are sufficient for me. One or the other could be improved. The sleep tracker usually only works incorrectly for me and I have to manually change the duration afterwards. In order for the battery to last 30 days, it must be placed next to, rather than on, the arm. I have not activated many functions, have been wearing the watch permanently for 9 days and still have 20% battery left. Nevertheless, a good performance - especially for someone who had to charge their Apple Watch daily before going to bed. Notifications do not always work. The connection to the mobile phone is unfortunately interrupted very quickly, for example, if you just go to the toilet. And if you don't look at your watch quickly enough and the notification is already gone, you have no way of getting it displayed again. The selection of wristbands is enormous, as Withings uses the wristband standard that is also used for normal jeweler's watches. I was not aware of this before. Despite one or the other flaw, I love the Scanwatch and would buy it again at any time - especially at this price.

April 2, 2023 | Christian Could be better I bought this to replace my Fitbit. I wanted to get away from the Google ecosystem and liked my other Withings products. I liked the idea that it had basically the same features as my Fitbit but also had an advertised much longer battery (30 days instead of 7). As far as I can tell even though I spent a premium on my ScanWatch, its quite the downgrade. I get at most 14 days of battery, even with most features turned off. The sleep tracking is really hit or miss. Sometimes it cuts off my sleep by about 3-4 hours. I frequently have to go into the app and correct the wake-up times. In my 6 years of owning my various Fitbits, there's only been a handful of times that it didn't track properly. Another thing that kind of bothers me is the placement of the watch. It's a little uncomfortable to have to make sure it's always about an inch away from your wrist. If you want accurate readings at all you have to make sure it's in the correct position at all times, which means to lock it in a position that it doesn't naturally want to stay, you have to overly tighten your wrist band. This leaves marks on your skin where the skin tries to fill in the holes on the band and other spaces. If they can at least fix the sleep tracking issue it would gain a star... We shall see..
April 1, 2023 | Scott L Very good watch with some smart functionality Heart Rate, ECG, SPO2, Step counter are all useful features. The sleep tracking as well is very welcome, but one of the best features is having incoming calls / texts / whatsapp messages etc. displayed on the watch's small screen.

March 30, 2023 | Janos Replacing Steel HR. Unable to charge...
I used Steel HR for 2-3 years, but the battery life and the hands were a bit worn out, and they tended to shift even after adjusting them several times, so I decided to replace it with this model. In retrospect, I think it was a failure. Functionally, it is sufficient, but the charger's stability is poor, and it does not continue to charge. When I set it on the charger, it buzzes and says "Charging...", but sometimes it doesn't charge because the terminal contact is poor... I had to reset it several times before it finally recovered to 8%... that's how it is. It would be great if I could charge it with less stress.

March 22, 2023 | GIL Activity tracking Used with other devices, it is a good way to monitor one's health March 22, 2023 | Dinozzo Great watch, but incomplete I had this one and an Apple Watch 8 to choose from. Visually and in terms of battery life, I really liked the Withings. Great design. The health functions are also similarly good and accurate. Ultimately, however, practical functions kept me from choosing the watch. Firstly, the lack of GPS; so you always have to carry your smartphone with you if you want to go jogging, for example. The same goes for music. On the Apple Watch, I can store music from Apple or Spotify and then just exercise with the watch. Great thing. Otherwise, a great watch.
March 19, 2023 | anonymous Best health monitoring watch available.
Had a recent heart issue with AFIB, looked for a smart watch just for health and heart monitoring. Didn't need all the other stuff for sports apps. This is the best watch for health tracking with fantastic battery life! Very stylish also, I still like the looks of a conventional watch, this one is very good looking.
March 19, 2023 | anonymous Constantly complimented on watch...
Was never a huge watch guy but did like fitness trackers and just never was happy with the function AND look of other devices. I wanted a watch that looked like a traditional watch and could be worn in both informal and more formal environments. My first Withings watch was the Steel HR, which I loved, but when Scanwatch came out, I was looking for a new watch and was excited by the additional features this watch offered. Have not been disappointed at all. I constantly get complements on it as a watch, then when the folks commenting learn it's also a smart watch/fitness tracker, they're blown away. I love sleep tracking, alarm features, workout tracking, HR monitoring and breath work options.

Can do much more than you might think.
It is primarily a health watch. Nevertheless, it reliably records all workouts. Even messages are displayed in full as a running pace on the small display. Extremely comfortable to wear. The battery lasts easily 20 days. All activities can be exported as a report. The ECG and other values are very accurate. Reacts independently to heart rhythm disturbances. Clear purchase recommendation from me.

March 8, 2023 | RedFoxFinn Scan Watch I find the watch visually appealing. Unfortunately, the display is very small and difficult to read with increasing age. I like the focus on health functions. However, one always looks at the many alternative smartwatches that offer much more functions. I wish for an update with a larger display and more functions. Unfortunately, I have been waiting for it in vain. There has been no progress for years. I had a water damage with the watch once, annoying, but the service from Withings was very good.

Style. Use it with scale. Helps me review sleep patterns March 8, 2023 | Toby Design optimal, Software satisfactory I use the following ScanWatch functions: Watch, Steps/Floors, Pulse/Heart rate, Workout, Oxygen saturation during sleep, occasional EKG for suspected atrial fibrillation, Sleep March 8, 2023 | Alexander M.
Schlicht, robust, smart, einfach klasse I am excited about my Scanwatch. It looks very good, is robust and helps me in everyday life with its smart functions. But most importantly for me are the health data that I receive through the Scanwatch. When I am not at home, the sleep monitoring helps me to keep an eye on my sleep apnea. Oxygen saturation and pulse are quite interesting parameters. In combination with my Body Cardio, Thermo, BPM Connect and Sleep, I receive comprehensive health values that provide me with important information. I am excited and could even convince my wife to get a Scanwatch.

Battery life sensational I use the Scanwatch together with a Withings scale and a Withings blood pressure monitor. This way I always have an overview of my daily measurements. The clinical validation makes it easier for these values to be taken seriously by the doctor. I especially like the simple design and the long battery life.
March 8, 2023 | Robert Gesundheit Easy to use March 8, 2023 | HDD Top Watch Long Battery Life March 8, 2023 | Eckehardt Design optimal, Software satisfactory I use the following ScanWatch functions: Watch, Steps/Floors, Pulse/Heart rate, Workout, Oxygen saturation during sleep, occasional EKG for suspected atrial fibrillation, Sleep March 8, 2023 | Alexander Metz My personal guardian in the background! My Witthings watch accompanies me day and night. During the day, it reminds me to move, shows me the current blood pressure, the oxygen level in the blood, and an EKG. Of course, it also reminds me of appointments. And at night, the Witthings watch monitors my sleep.
March 8, 2023 | Formosadragon Very good health watch, compromises in sports Beautiful sporty design, very good accuracy and variety of health data, very long battery life. The only drawback is that the measurements during sports (heart rate) are inaccurate, sometimes wrong or interrupted. In combination with BPM Connect and Body Cardio and the analysis through the Health Mate app, it provides very good control and monitoring of one's own health to make the necessary corrections if needed.
March 8, 2023 | Gerd Blood Pressure Independence 2 other devices March 8, 2023 | fern Scan Watch I find the watch visually appealing. Unfortunately, the display is very small and difficult to read with increasing age. I like the focus on health functions.

Unfortunately, I have been waiting for it in vain. There has been no progress for years. I had a water damage with the watch once, annoying, but the service from Withings was very good.

Motivates one to engage with their health and well-being. The existing EKG and pulse monitoring are things I no longer want to miss. The Scanwatch reliably keeps you up to date on your own training goals.
March 7, 2023 | Detlef Scanwatch is Advanced The data points Scanwatch monitors and reports are the key health indicators and positive habits. The data is precise and overall looks pretty accurate. It is seamless to wear the watch virtually always, and I love the battery life. I have used the watch with the scale which is an excellent addition to the watch. I also have had the under-mattress sleep device for at least two years and it has been one disappointment after another. It will not stay signed on to my wifi and in the few stretches when it does stay hooked up, I find the results to be very inaccurate and random. I called the help desk and got a few suggestions that helped for short time but then it was back to its old ways. Suspecting it was out of warranty so I just bought a new sleep monitor device from Amazon and it seems better but too soon to tell if will stay better and become trusted.
March 7, 2023 | Lamar C Smith I bought a watch two years ago I have a watch that is not repairable for 2 years March 7, 2023 | Ahmedazali Mu faitfull wrist companion I have several withings products, the watch is not obtrusive and works as advertised March 7, 2023 | Robbie Response Being able to read the information on the watch March 7, 2023 | Réré Perfect watch!

It has an attractive aesthetic augmented by the ability to swap out bands. Clean design. Excellent companion app displaying all relevant measures at a glance, including measures from other Withings devices I own (scale, BP cuff, and thermometer). Selected notifications from my phone are also displayed, albeit temporarily and only once (which is a good thing for me!) March 7, 2023 | hksmith Problem with Android 13 Beautiful design, great battery life, the right features for me March 7, 2023 | Jörg At the time of the heart.
Cardiac for over ten years, I always monitor the frequency of my heart rate during my sports training, the one I should not exceed according to the faculty... Controlling my weight with the connected scale has also been very helpful. I also like to check the duration and quality of my sleep. And then, setting a goal for the number of steps and becoming aware of reality is particularly satisfying!

March 7, 2023 | Andreas Alois Gut Appealing Smartwatch Quick monitoring of vital functions. Elegant design. Super long battery life.
March 7, 2023 | Michael Coole Hybrid Watch, but...
Visually very nice and in combination with the smart functions it meets my expectations exactly, but the stainless steel bracelet cannot be adjusted exactly in length, either it is too short or too long. There are better solutions where you can adjust the length more precisely at the clasp. The GPS recording for cycling activity is also not recorded. There is already a ticket for this, which has been open for almost three weeks now and has been forwarded to development. So everything is not quite mature yet.

March 7, 2023 | Verena Interesting results I have the blue dial edition and gold case. Looks great. However, the measurement results are not always plausible. In addition, a Body Cardio scale is also used.

It relaxes well and helps falling asleep. I use the walking function in sports practically every day. It's very motivating, although I don't necessarily need motivation. And no, I don't use any other Withings product.
March 7, 2023 | Nédina Reliability and efficiency Very reliable watch, I have had it for 3 years (scanwatch) to monitor a heart murmur. Lately, it has detected episodes of atrial fibrillation and accelerated heart rate at rest. The battery still lasts between 3 and 4 weeks, nothing to complain about. The bracelet still holds up even when working with the watch every day. The only downside is that sometimes I would like to be able to turn off the watch. There is no such functionality. It is rare for me not to wear it, I only take it off for showering.
March 7, 2023 | Ricardo Chic Beautiful chic watch that doesn't look like a smart watch at first glance. Still has all the important functions. Still using the blood pressure monitor March 7, 2023 | Bianca Reliable! In 2021, this scale showed my husband that he has atrial fibrillation. It may have saved his life.

March 7, 2023 | LSN Louis Long-lasting smartwatch with a classic look Scanwatch is a unique product on the market. It has a very classical look. It lasts 3 weeks on a single battery charge. It packs a number of health-related features. It stops distractions since I can simply silence my phone and react just to the discreet vibrations on my wrist.

The reliable connectivity to the mobile phone is also given and there, in turn, in the app, all other statistics of the other devices from the series are available. It helps to achieve realistic goals well, of course, only with the self-discipline that one should bring. The only drawback is that you cannot connect many other apps for nutrition tracking, such as YAZIO March 7, 2023 | Andreas Hart rate and o2 level it provides the information I want when I want with a single push in the button March 7, 2023 | Bob Excellent device Smart looking, accurate and robust March 7, 2023 | Blackers Uncomplicated Smartwatch Long battery life March 7, 2023 | Stefan W.

The app makes it easy to understand the data and manage the settings of the watch. I mostly track sleep, exercise plus weight plus I wake up with the wrist alarm. My second Withings watch.
March 7, 2023 | Z Rundum-Scan It helps me, along with the scale (Body Cardio), and the blood pressure monitor (BPM Connect), to have my health data under control at all times. A good tool to discuss with the doctor, so to speak, on an equal footing.
March 7, 2023 | Johann Simple and reliable Discreet, The smartphone interface is easy to use and complements the use of the watch perfectly...the best part is the watch's battery life. I can keep the watch for several weeks before recharging it.

Smart scale Body+ is more reliable.

The ability to measure EKGs and blood oxygen saturation is a great addition.
March 7, 2023 | Matthias an essential watch Tracking steps, activities, heart monitoring March 7, 2023 | Isabelle Wertig The watch is of good quality, but for 499€ there are better options on the market. However, since I also have the scale and blood pressure monitor, it is a good addition.
March 7, 2023 | Monetaer Good activity tracking but not sleep tracking Activity tracking (steps) is very good. The floor tracking is also very effective and gives a good idea of the activity even without any activity tracking from the watch. However, sleep tracking is not accurate at all or rather, it never triggers at the times when I go to bed and wake up. Nap tracking is also not supported, which can be inconvenient for some users. I really like the aesthetic aspect of the watch and that's the main reason for my purchase. No one thinks it's a smartwatch (which it isn't exactly). The build quality is very good. The case is made of steel and the glass is sapphire (after a year, I have no scratches on the screen). However, the case back is only glued and not fitted. It's a surprising choice by Withings because the back eventually comes off before the end of the warranty period (in my case, it came off 13 months after the purchase). I had this issue even though I don't wear my watch to take a shower or go swimming. I hope this design issue will be resolved in the future (I'm not the only one who has had this kind of problem). Despite the inaccuracy of sleep tracking, the lack of reliability in heart rate tracking, and the case problem, I recommend this watch because it's the only one that allows for precise activity tracking without having a smartwatch that lacks elegance.

March 7, 2023 | Natlion Watch of very good technical quality Useful for my health and sports tracking. I use other Withings products March 7, 2023 | Jule30 Quantum leap of hybrid watches I have been a fan of Withings products for several generations of devices and I don't want to give up the Scanwatch. Whether it's EKG, tips for movement, body data capture, sleep analysis, and more, the watch has enriched my life.
March 7, 2023 | Stefan Dehnert Reliability of tracking I use the connected scale and blood-pressure monitor in addition to the watch. Tracking heart rate during sports activities, helps with weight loss and fat mass.

March 7, 2023 | Johann Optimal Health Monitor Very good! I use a temperature device. Unfortunately, I had to give up on the good products (scale and blood pressure monitor) in the meantime (pacemaker for 1 year) March 7, 2023 | helkue 88888 no March 7, 2023 | robert Herz Sleep monitoring, atrial fibrillation No, no other product...

It is not the typical smartwatch for pseudo-tech geeks.
March 7, 2023 | Startreker Comprehensive health monitoring The ScanWatch not only counts my steps but also gives me an overview of my sleep quality. The ability to measure EKGs and blood oxygen saturation is a great addition.
March 7, 2023 | Matthias Wertig The watch is of good quality, but for 499€ there are better options on the market. However, since I also have the scale and blood pressure monitor set, it is a good addition.

March 7, 2023 | Dirk Quantum leap of hybrid watches I have been a fan of Withings products for several generations of devices and I don't want to give up the Scanwatch. Whether it's EKG, tips for movement, body data capture, sleep analysis, and more, the watch has enriched my life.

March 7, 2023 | KO Unobtrusive classic-looking SmartWatch I like the simple unobtrusive design as well as the good user guidance, with longer battery life. Also, the reliable connectivity to the phone is given and there, in turn, in the app, all other statistics of the other devices from the series are available. It helps to achieve realistic goals well, of course, only with the self-discipline that one should bring. The only drawback is that you cannot connect many other apps for nutrition tracking, such as YAZIO.
March 7, 2023 | Andreas Best Hybridsmartwatch The design and 30-day battery life is perfect! The best watch I have ever bought.
March 7, 2023 | Fabian Coole Hybrid Watch, but...
Visually very nice and in combination with the smart functions it meets my expectations exactly, but the stainless steel bracelet cannot be adjusted exactly in length, either it is too short or too long. There are better solutions where you can adjust the length more precisely at the clasp. The GPS recording for cycling activity is also not recorded. There is already a ticket for this, which has been open for almost three weeks now and has been forwarded to development. So everything is not quite mature yet.
March 7, 2023 | Manfred Problem with Android 13 Beautiful design, great battery life, the right functions for me March 7, 2023 | Jörg Schöne Smartwatch This is a beautiful watch with which I can record all important parameters and has an extraordinary battery life.

Cardiac for over ten years, I always monitor the frequency of my heart rate during my sports training, the one I should not exceed according to the faculty... Controlling my weight with the connected scale has also been very helpful. I also like to check the duration and quality of my sleep. And then, setting a goal for the number of steps and becoming aware of reality is particularly satisfying! March 7, 2023 | Fredo30 Performance and autonomy Combines both health benefits and a connected watch, but much better because it looks like a real elegant watch March 7, 2023 | Jonathan My inseparable Already give me the time 😉 Then I use all the functions and I particularly like the 7 breathing exercises in the evening in bed. It relaxes well and helps falling asleep. I use the walking function in sports practically every day. It's very motivating, although I don't necessarily need motivation. And no, I don't use any other Withings product.
March 7, 2023 | Nédina Reliability and efficiency Very reliable watch, I have had it for 3 years (scanwatch) to monitor a heart murmur. Lately, it has detected episodes of atrial fibrillation and accelerated heart rate at rest. The battery still lasts between 3 and 4 weeks, nothing to complain about. The bracelet still holds up even when working with the watch every day. The only downside is that sometimes I would like to be able to turn off the watch. There is no such functionality. It is rare for me not to wear it, I only take it off for showering.

The floor tracking is also very effective and gives a good idea of the activity even without any activity tracking from the watch. However, sleep tracking is not accurate at all or rather, it never triggers at the times when I go to bed and wake up. Nap tracking is also not supported, which can be inconvenient for some users. I really like the aesthetic aspect of the watch and that's the main reason for my purchase. No one thinks it's a smartwatch (which it isn't exactly). The build quality is very good. The case is made of steel and the glass is sapphire (after a year, I have no scratches on the screen). However, the case back is only glued and not fitted. It's a surprising choice by Withings because the back eventually comes off before the end of the warranty period (in my case, it came off 13 months after the purchase). I had this issue even though I don't wear my watch to take a shower or go swimming. I hope this design issue will be resolved in the future (I'm not the only one who has had this kind of problem). Despite the inaccuracy of sleep tracking, the lack of reliability in heart rate tracking, and the case problem, I recommend this watch because it's the only one that allows for precise activity tracking without having a smartwatch that lacks elegance.
March 7, 2023 | Calixte Number of steps Pedometer yes March 7, 2023 | Toph Long battery life: approx. 1 month Battery life, compared to other watches I've had in the past.

I love Withings March 6, 2023 | DWS Comprehensive Stylish Health Monitor Helps to keep track of steps and heart rate, used in conjunction with Withings Sleep, Withings scales and Withings BPM provides a great reference point to my normal and helps with setting health goals.
March 6, 2023 | MartinF I love tracking my progress I’m a very loyal fan for years now. Bought my second watch not too long ago. I love the functionality of it, it monitors what’s important to me, and after many years of use, I love to see the changes - biorhythms, sleeping patterns, tracking my exercise levels, etc.
March 6, 2023 | Mara Tracking without being tied to a charger The main things that I like about the scanwatch are the battery life, it's appearance and the ecosystem. The battery lasts for 3-4 weeks depending how often you have a sports session, which is far easier to manage than the 24-48 hours most smart watches provide. The appearance is great, it looks like a standard watch, and there is no need to press anything if you just want the time. The ecosystem is good as I can have my blood pressure readings from the BPM Connect and the weight/fat % from my Body plus scales all together with my Scanwatch reading in one app. Overall I am very pleased with all my Withings devices.

March 6, 2023 | Joe Your concerns are modified heart rate sleep time etc March 6, 2023 | ruan The best watch I've ever had The ScanWatch convinced me from the beginning. It offered me everything I needed: sleep analysis, heart rate measurement, oxygen measurement, and a clinically certified EKG. The battery life then completely convinced me. The ScanWatch offers the best of both worlds: enough smart health functions and the elegant, classic design of a wristwatch.

March 6, 2023 | Lenebs Smart watch with style My Scanwatch does everything I need from a smart watch and more without being a distraction and it looks fantastic. Subtle alerts for important calls and emails and a great suite of health monitoring tools in a device that looks at home in the gym, in the office or on a night out.

March 6, 2023 | Mlyne Satisfied Heart monitoring in relation to the phone March 6, 2023 | phil13600 Stylish, practical, full of features! This is my 3rd Withings watch and so far my favourite. It has all the features I want to monitor my health and track my workouts. And all this is done without sacrificing style. I like the classic look, less cluttered than other smart watches, and the fact that the battery lasts so long makes it perfect! March 6, 2023 | Harry D.
verbesserungswürdig Functionality, good battery life March 6, 2023 | JoRi Smartwatch, which is only missing a little Reliable and versatile March 6, 2023 | Jörg Hanisch Good but could be better I like the watch, it is beautiful, elegant and simple, it provides the essentials and its autonomy is remarkable. I also have the Body Cardio scale. That being said, two remarks: first, the watch is only half accurate for sleep because it considers that one is sleeping if one does not move (during insomnia for example), which distorts the real sleep time, and nothing about REM sleep (unlike the Apple watch); secondly, the scale only completes the full cycle once out of ten and measures heart rate very randomly (not very important in the end..).
March 6, 2023 | Arnaud Extremely long battery life I use the Scanwatch daily. It is a reliable companion in everyday life. Even during long hikes of approximately 50km per day, it always provides accurate results.
March 6, 2023 | Rüdiger Indispensable Daily Companion March 6, 2023 | Mo78955 Fast Perfekt I own various Withings products and they not only look very good, they are reliable, the battery lasts a long time and they provide almost all the health data you need. The only thing missing is heart rate variability, although it should be calculated during an EKG determination. Too bad. In the app, I miss the ability to enter, for example, blood sugar values, as an important health parameter. Even better would be a Bluetooth blood sugar device from Withings. Otherwise, everything is great.
March 6, 2023 | PDog Great in every way Horizon is super beautiful Tracking fitness level inspired me to improve this. Since using it, I also do a lot more sports. I try to reach my 10,000 steps.

Great for daily workouts such as running or cycling!Also use it for sleep, it is well documented light and deep sleep phases, as well as the pulse during the night and the duration of sleep and interruptions!I do not use the notifications for calls, SMS, etc. for me the watch is purely for health and sports purposes! March 6, 2023 | René Health monitoring with style Simple and discreet, good and clear app, easy to use, good battery life, also have the Body Scale and Sleep Analyzer March 6, 2023 | Vanessa Heart monitoring I use the Horizon Scanwatch and the Body+ scale. Through the app, I always have many health data at hand.
March 6, 2023 | Karl Fashionable watch with health functions I really like the Hybridwatch. It has a classic elegant look and offers all the functions for a health-conscious life. Additionally, it is capable of displaying notifications (calls, SMS, WhatsApp, ...). However, you cannot make phone calls or pay at the cash register with the ScanWatch. Also, you cannot retrieve historical data (last sleep analysis, EKG, ...). This is where the clear and intuitive Withings App comes in. It only displays current data. As Withings is a health expert, the development of the products is strongly focused in this direction. The accuracy of the captured data surprises me every time. Since I also use the 'BPM Core', I believe I can monitor my health very well. Unfortunately, I often misplace my phone, so I would like a 'find my phone' function. Or a display on the watch showing the Bluetooth connection to the phone.

Elegant A watch first, even if connected March 6, 2023 | Jorge Best hybrid watch ever!!!! Love the design, power reserve, the build quality and the available functions. Best watch for me March 6, 2023 | Andrew Best price-performance ratio, top design The watch stands out with a timeless, beautiful design and is also technologically advanced. Its battery life of around 3 weeks between charges is unmatched in the smartwatch industry! March 6, 2023 | Roland Style without all of the clutter The ScanWatch is a great looking watch with all of the major features of the Apple Watch but non of the excessive apps that you will never use. The combination of the analog and digital displays isn’t a compromise but the best of both worlds. The the O2, heart rate and ECG sensors all work great and the battery life is excellent.

March 6, 2023 | Guillaume Old user All round it’s good and useful. In the past though (perhaps with earlier versions) it was great to have the swimming lap counter. If this was to be available again it would be great.
March 6, 2023 | Giant Paul Can save your life Thanks to my scanwatch, I was able to record my arrhythmia episodes and my cardiologist could see what type of arrhythmia it was and treat me. He was delighted because, as he told me: otherwise, we have nothing, you have to be lucky enough to have this arrhythmia in the cardiologist's office!!! So: very satisfied with this scanwatch! March 6, 2023 | Fanta22 Battery life: unbeatably long Waking up during sleep due to heart palpitations and/or racing... quickly write an EKG and go back to sleep reassured.
March 6, 2023 | JMüller Very good equipment Reliable and durable equipment that fully meets my requirements for tracking fitness/weight/sleep/health March 6, 2023 | TAZ Love it - but breaks easily The perfect combo of style and function. Track weight, sleep & pulse. Had two different models, but both broke after a while after normal daily use.
March 6, 2023 | Peter Gustafsson A dedicated companion I appreciate: ========== - The battery autonomy and its fairly quick charging time - As someone with arrhythmia, I appreciate the detection of A.F. and the precise monitoring of heart rate. As for the E.C.G, it would be necessary to compare it with that of a professional device. I dislike: =========== - The calculation of the number of steps is completely random and bogus. Just sit and swing your arms for 2 hours to have taken 10,000 steps. - The number of hours of sleep is completely bogus. Just lie down without moving to consider that you are sleeping.
March 6, 2023 | PAT Gestalterisch top, expandable functions Sports activities (here more features would be desirable). Health tracker (heart rate, oxygen, sleep, EKG) very good. Connection GPS with iPhone is very unreliable.

March 6, 2023 | Tom Beautiful design, very good battery life After having good experiences with the Steel HR, I was curious about the ScanWatch. Overall, I quite like it, only the heart rate measurement is unfortunately very inaccurate - sometimes even worse than with the Steel HR. I am curious to see if the firmware update announced by the support will improve this.
March 6, 2023 | Willie Wonka Classic style health watch.

March 6, 2023 | Michel Vancoppenolle Beautiful but imprecise and without customer support A very elegant watch but the collected data is much less precise than other similar ones and the customer service ignores the problems...
March 6, 2023 | Pims Average user experience The Scanwatch works very well, has a very long battery life. I use it with the under-mattress recorder (sleep) and the ECG BPM core blood pressure monitor. I find the Healthmate app confusing and the Scanwatch documentation as well. (Apparently, I'm almost sure), you need a smartphone close to the Scanwatch to retrieve the data, otherwise we don't know how long it keeps them. Some services appeared (by mistake) like the scan during sleep, but I can't find the results. Apparently, the Scanwatch monitors oxygen saturation during sleep, but I doubt it (I have another device (Wellue SleepU) that does it very well). I learned that if you break the watch's glass, it goes straight to the trash.

March 6, 2023 | Guillaume Quality and customer service 👍 Withings customer for several years with multiple products (scale, blood-pressure monitor, and ScanWatch). Withings products are innovative and effective.

Tracking without being tied to a charger The main things that I like about the scanwatch are the battery life, it's appearance and the ecosystem. The battery lasts for 3-4 weeks depending how often you have a sports session, which is far easier to manage than the 24-48 hours most smart watches provide. The appearance is great, it looks like a standard watch, and there is no need to press anything if you just want the time. The ecosystem is good as I can have my blood pressure readings from the BPM Connect and the weight/fat % from my Body plus scales all together with my Scanwatch reading in one app. Overall I am very pleased with all my Withings devices.
March 6, 2023 | Dazaster Top Works great, battery holds up as promised, so far without any problems, better than expected March 6, 2023 | anonymous Great watch A great watch, more elegant than expected, not so sporty but a very good purchase March 6, 2023 | anonymous The best watch I've ever had The ScanWatch convinced me from the beginning. It offered me everything I needed: sleep analysis, heart rate measurement, oxygen measurement, and a clinically certified EKG. The battery life then completely convinced me. The ScanWatch offers the best of both worlds: enough smart health functions and the elegant, classic design of a wristwatch.
March 6, 2023 | Andreas Wiedel good watch long battery life, good readability March 6, 2023 | Michael With the scale, additional information With the scale, info from the phone, calls, emails, steps, pulse, calories March 6, 2023 | avovat77 Gesundheit aktuell This product monitors my personal day and night.

Reliable technology I like the shape of the watch. Comprehensive information about its daily condition. Blood pressure monitor and scale from Withings are also in use.
March 6, 2023 | Holger Good watch, high-quality processing Oxygen saturation, step counter, EKG March 6, 2023 | Siris verbesserungswürdig Functionality, good battery life March 6, 2023 | JoRi Smartwatch, which is only missing a little Reliable and versatile March 6, 2023 | Jörg Hanisch Extremely long battery life I use the Scanwatch daily. It is a reliable companion in everyday life. Even during long hikes of approximately 50km per day, it always provides accurate results.
March 6, 2023 | Rüdiger Fast Perfekt I own various Withings products and they not only look very good, they are reliable, the battery lasts a long time and they provide almost all the health data you need. The only thing missing is heart rate variability, although it should be calculated during an EKG determination. Too bad. In the app, I miss the ability to enter, for example, blood sugar values, as an important health parameter. Even better would be a Bluetooth blood sugar device from Withings. Otherwise, everything is great.
March 6, 2023 | PDog Great in every way Horizon is super beautiful Tracking fitness level inspired me to improve this. Since using it, I also do a lot more sports. I try to reach my 10,000 steps.

Through the app, I always have many health data at hand.
March 6, 2023 | Karl Fashionable watch with health functions I really like the Hybridwatch. It has a classic elegant look and offers all the functions for a health-conscious life. Additionally, it is capable of displaying notifications (calls, SMS, WhatsApp, ...). However, you cannot make phone calls or pay at the cash register with the ScanWatch. Also, you cannot retrieve historical data (last sleep analysis, EKG, ...). This is where the clear and intuitive Withings App comes in. It only displays current data. As Withings is a health expert, the development of the products is strongly focused in this direction. The accuracy of the captured data surprises me every time. Since I also use the 'BPM Core', I believe I can monitor my health very well. Unfortunately, I often misplace my phone, so I would like a 'find my phone' function. Or a display on the watch showing the Bluetooth connection to the phone.

Best price-performance ratio, top design The watch stands out with a timeless, beautiful design and is also technologically advanced. Its battery life of around 3 weeks between charges is unmatched in the smartwatch industry! March 6, 2023 | Roland very good quality I have 2 watches, 1 scale, blood pressure monitor and sleep monitoring mat March 6, 2023 | Wolfgang Battery life: unbeatably long Waking up in sleep due to heart palpitations and/or racing... quickly write an EKG and go back to sleep reassured.

March 6, 2023 | Tom Beautiful design, very good battery life After having good experiences with the Steel HR, I was curious about the ScanWatch. Overall, I quite like it, only the heart rate measurement is unfortunately very inaccurate - sometimes even worse than with the Steel HR. I am curious to see if the firmware update announced by the support will improve this.

Allows discreet and effective tracking, day and night, of my activity. I use my watch with 2 other Withings products, a scale and a blood-pressure monitor, I am very satisfied, the rest of the family too.
March 6, 2023 | Lenebs Reliability Accurate counting of steps and kilometers. A well-evaluated sleep, coupled with a scale and blood-pressure monitor, provides an interesting report for my doctor March 6, 2023 | Gimerje Easy to use. And compliments for my For my health and sports.
March 6, 2023 | Mlyne Satisfied Heart monitoring in relation to the phone March 6, 2023 | phil13600 Good but could be better I like the watch, it is beautiful, elegant and simple, it provides the essentials and its autonomy is remarkable. I also have the Body Cardio scale. That being said, two remarks: first, the watch is only half accurate for sleep because it considers that one is sleeping if one does not move (during insomnia for example), which distorts the real sleep time, and nothing about REM sleep (unlike the Apple watch); secondly, the scale only completes the full cycle once out of ten and measures heart rate very randomly (not very important in the end..).

March 6, 2023 | Guillaume Can save your life Thanks to my scanwatch, I was able to record my arrhythmia episodes and my cardiologist could see what type of arrhythmia it was and treat me. He was delighted because, as he told me: otherwise, we have nothing, you have to be lucky enough to have this arrhythmia in the cardiologist's office!!! So: very satisfied with this scanwatch! March 6, 2023 | Fanta22 Very good equipment Reliable and durable equipment that fully meets my requirements for tracking fitness/weight/sleep/health March 6, 2023 | TAZ A dedicated companion I appreciate: ========== - The battery autonomy and its fairly quick charging time - As someone with arrhythmia, I appreciate the detection of A.F. and the precise monitoring of heart rate. As for the E.C.G, it would be necessary to compare it with that of a professional device. I dislike: =========== - The calculation of the number of steps is completely random and bogus. Just sit and swing your arms for 2 hours to have taken 10,000 steps. - The number of hours of sleep is completely bogus. Just lie down without moving to consider that you are sleeping.
March 6, 2023 | PAT Excellent product Efficiently and simply meets my expectations regarding the monitoring of my health parameters while being a very pleasant watch with good autonomy.

March 6, 2023 | Michel Vancoppenolle Beautiful but imprecise and without customer support A very elegant watch but the collected data is much less precise than other similar ones and the customer service ignores the problems...
March 6, 2023 | Pims Average user experience The scanwatch works very well, has a very long battery life. I use it with the under-mattress recorder (sleep) and the ECG BPM core blood pressure monitor. I find the Healthmate app confusing and the Scanwatch documentation as well. (Apparently, I'm almost sure), you need a smartphone close to the scanwatch to retrieve the data, otherwise we don't know how long it keeps them. Some services appeared (by mistake) like the scan during sleep, but I can't find the results. Apparently, the scanwatch monitors oxygen saturation during sleep, but I doubt it (I have another device (Wellue SleepU) that does it very well). I learned that if you break the watch's glass, it goes straight to the trash.

A word 'Functionality' Connectivity March 4, 2023 | Québec Scanwatch I like taking my ecg in the morning, it's helpful to see my sleep breathing and spo. I also use thermo in the morning and the scale on weekends. I have the BP monitor, just need to get back into the habit of using it.
March 4, 2023 | Bob Beautiful watch, hidden fitness tracker! Early adopter due to watch styling and continuous fitness improvements. Currently enjoying my Scanwatch Horizon’s dive watch styling and the latest health metrics. Not a fan of hyper-fitness designs so a focus on good-looks by Withings make these devices unique.
March 4, 2023 | Jon Hill Smart watch Delivered on time. Item as expected. Good battery life.
March 4, 2023 | anonymous A word 'Functionality' Connectivity March 4, 2023 | Québec Glitches here and there Love that it looks like a regular watch, step count and if I feel I need take pulse or oxygen level I can do there and then. I use to check and monitor my weight and blood pressure with same company products or take a note from dr visit. Glitches on adding exercise i haven't done and button very sensitive if you are leaning to get up or if bending wrist up for anything, other then that I like my watch.
March 3, 2023 | Toni More features Sapphire dial, easy messaging, and O2 level measuring March 3, 2023 | Bob Smartwatch with smartwatch functions...........
 offers everything a smartwatch should do. Accessing the menu items is a bit cumbersome, but the ScanWatch runs longer without charging than most much more expensive comparison devices.
March 3, 2023 | Saeco Great watch do oxygen test twice Like the knowledge on hand literally March 3, 2023 | Alexis So much better than the others This is the perfect watch / tracker combo. Waterproof with a 30 day charge life. Unlike the other products I have owned by other companies, I never have to take the Scan Watch off. It performs flawlessly for me and the app is so easy to navigate. I truly feel that Withings far exceeds the competition. We use it along with the Withings scale and blood pressure monitor.
March 3, 2023 | PRA7 Reviews Tracking health vital statistics Simple and intuitive to use March 3, 2023 | Alybaba Quality Keeps my health at the forefront of a busy life March 3, 2023 | Ryan Great! Extremely versatile watch with great features! First of all: The battery lasts a long time! I have activated almost all functions (pulse, sleep recording, apnea, oxygen content... etc.). Nevertheless, the watch only needs to be charged every 10 days. The battery lasts significantly longer if not all functions are activated. Extremely great feel, solid case, quite heavy compared to well-known sports watches (although the comparison is not quite correct). I have been using the watch since the end of 2022 and would buy it again at any time. Accessories are available for purchase, so changing the straps and colors is possible (nylon, rubber, leather).
March 3, 2023 | anonymous Used goods Although it is called used goods, it was not described that the watch is not complete. The strap is missing and the description is missing.

March 3, 2023 | Saeco Stylish practicality Provides good practical information for tracking health data. It love that it links to my blood pressure machine and scale so that all my health info is available in one place. Frequently get compliments on how stylish and attractive the watch is.
March 2, 2023 | Kitty1096 Hybrid Beats Smarwatch Very happy with my Scanwatch. It is a great balance between a 'smartwatch' and a classy timepiece. It provides me with the notification information necessary and importantly - a 30-DAY BATTERY LIFE! Love that! March 2, 2023 | JDR Classic look for a smartwatch I like the sleep and activity features. I have the weight scale and recently bought a watch for my wife.
March 2, 2023 | Gene Great data tracking Useful data and insights March 2, 2023 | James Better than an Apple Watch The ScanWatch is my second from Withings - I owned the Steel HR for about 5 years - and love this almost as much. Integrates well with the app and my Body+ scale, fits comfortably and as a Withings it looks stylish (like a watch not a fitness product!). My only complaint is the fussiness of activating the EKG function, and the frequency of inadvertently activating the workout tracking (and then trying to shut it off!). The rolling vs just button-pressing method to get to functions I don't think is as flawless as previous. But otherwise it works great as part of my fitness lifestyle and of course providing me with access to my communications.
March 2, 2023 | Hdavids1 All the functions but with style I'm an early Withings adopter - scale, watch and blood pressure cuff. I bought one of the other smart watches and missed my Withings, so now I am back. The biggest pluses over other options - battery life and looks.
March 2, 2023 | Robert G Sophisticated look, long battery life I needed something to alert me when I'm focused. For the most part this does the job. I only have important notifications through so I can ignore the others. Besides that, I use it for tracking my hikes and once a month use it's various health tests.
March 2, 2023 | Gary Gendel Great watch! My scanwatch horizon is my second Withings watch. I love that it looks like a normal watch. Plus, the battery life is fantastic! March 2, 2023 | Mitch Looks great and performs better More accurate than previous versions and a looks great March 2, 2023 | Djw Excellent watch Exercise tracking and electrocardiogram March 2, 2023 | Luis Very good but not great Is a great-looking watch. Get many comments. Needs more and nicer band options. App is good but tracking seems a bit off when compared to other fitness watches and trackers that I have.
March 2, 2023 | Doug Fantastic stylish watch that's functional I use it with my scale to keep track of my health.
March 2, 2023 | Troy B Hybrid Beats Smarwatch Very happy with my Scanwatch. It is a great balance between a 'smartwatch' and a classy timepiece. It provides me with the notification information necessary and importantly - a 30-DAY BATTERY LIFE! Love that! March 2, 2023 | JDR Almost like a regular one? It looks almost like an analog watch, is not too heavy and looks very good. I immediately ordered the black leather strap, which can be attached easily without tools, and the quality is excellent here too. The watch measures my vital signs and my steps very reliably. Counting floors also works precisely. The workout recognition is better than many competitors. If you can do without blood pressure measurement (which usually needs calibration every few weeks anyway) and like analog watches, you should give this fine watch a chance. By the way, I chose the black model in 42. The app is also well done and is still regularly updated, it is clear and comes without advertising, thanks Withings.
March 2, 2023 | anonymous Excellent watch Exercise tracking and electrocardiogram March 2, 2023 | Luis a fib scanning my weight and bp for A Fib March 1, 2023 | jerry Long Battery Life The decisive factor for me was the indicated long battery life and the elegant look of the watch. Sleep monitoring and breathing monitoring work very well, as does ECG, pulse monitoring, and oxygen saturation. The battery life is considerable, with a remaining runtime of 12% after 23 days.
March 1, 2023 | anonymous Ability to edit Likes: long battery life, accuracy in data, ability to do ecg, resp, and O2 sat. I do not have other withings products. Dislikes: can edit sleep duration, but cannot add in a nap, and sleep data is not filled in from the time period. So, if I wake up at 7:30, but go back to sleep from 8-10, I can add the 2 hours by extending the sleep duration to 9:30, but the data regarding deep / REM etc sleep is not there. Fitbit can edit sleep better.
February 27, 2023 | Kelly Good, but PLEASE add Menstruation I like that this watch has a fair battery life and is able to track major aspects of my health and exercise. However, I would love for Withings to add a menstruation feature to track cycles, symptoms, and more to better understand our bodies as women.
February 26, 2023 | Marisa Steps, heart rate, and notifications Quick information and notifications at a glance February 26, 2023 | Court A nice tether I like it first as a bridge or tether between important messages from my family (text), second as a watch, third as a fitness tracker.
February 26, 2023 | Mar Simple and easy to use, with style.
I use the scanwatch for ekg function, sleep monitoring and fitness. Be aware that the AFIB monitoring and alert is not activated for the watch in the USA. The ekg must be done manually by the user if they think they are in AFIB. Also the sleep monitor does not track REM sleep only deep sleep. Aside from these issues, the scanwatch works very well and I am happy with it.
February 26, 2023 | David Classy Watch I love the analog look and feel. It has a touch of class while still giving modern features of a connected watch.
February 25, 2023 | Demetri Very good with some reservations I have them to monitor my atrial fibrillation.

What I like most about these watches: the battery charging time, which differentiates it the most from its competitors, the alarm clock by vibration so practical! The tracking by sleep graph and all physiological functions, the ease of communication when questioning... It is beautiful and efficient, I love it! February 25, 2023 | Gab A good start… I like the way my skin watch wears and looks. And it has held up well. I also like that I don’t have to charge it but about three times a month. But the data just does not seem to be accurate always. When I go out and walk for a few miles I’ll come home and it’ll tell me that I went .4 miles. And I feel there are some accuracy issues with sleep inn steps counted sometimes and also with fitness level. I really enjoyed wearing a watch, but wish that I had more confidence in some of the data. Thanks.
February 25, 2023 | Ralph This is great you should buy :) This watch as well as looking cool helps with phone notifications and workouts, it’s definitely worth the buy.

Nice elegant smartwatch with a few limitation It is a nice watch that doesn't look like a smart watch. It feels good to wear. The best part is the long battery life, unlike most smart watch February 24, 2023 | Bonquiqui Ideal for health monitoring A 'health watch' that includes everything you need. Very clear and also a real 'jewel' that fits every occasion and every outfit.
February 24, 2023 | anonymous Beautiful and functional Great watch, beautifully crafted and great features, fulfills its purposes wonderfully.
February 24, 2023 | anonymous Withings ScanWatch Hybrid Smartwatch with ECG, heart rate sensor and oximeter Meets my expectations for a ScanWatch. With the help of Amazon product support, everything is okay.
February 23, 2023 | anonymous Toll Good product; EKG works great. Very helpful February 22, 2023 | anonymous Withings ScanWatch Delivered as ordered. Serves its purpose. The long battery life is noteworthy. Values are comparable to medical results. Recommended for older users! February 21, 2023 | anonymous I love you So far, I can only report positive things. It was very easy to set up, the battery is still at 70% despite a week of use. It looks great and the functions make my everyday life easier. 100% recommendation to buy.
February 21, 2023 | anonymous Well thought-out and accurate smartwatch in a discreet design As a result of excessive sports activities in my younger years, I now have an athlete's heart that often beats irregularly. Therefore, it became necessary to monitor my own heart rhythm regularly. After a long search, I ended up with the Withings. First of all: After almost a year of use, I am really very satisfied, the watch reliably and unspectacularly performs its daily service. The conception of this watch obviously focused on health aspects. Therefore, you cannot make phone calls, receive messages, listen to music or the like with it. This is about monitoring in a positive sense: oxygen saturation, breathing, pulse including rhythm disturbances and of course physical/sports activities. According to my findings, the sensors on the watch bottom measure quite accurately, but it is important that the bracelet is neither too tight nor too loose. The watch is described as hybrid: In fact, it is an analog wristwatch with an integrated analog pedometer and a small round screen. The watch is operated with just one button, by a combination of pressing and turning, which easily navigates through a logical menu displayed on the screen. I find this to be a well-thought-out and simple operation, especially after physical activity, as the button can also be easily operated with sweaty fingers. The recorded data is transmitted via BT to the SP, which is reliable and without any problems. Owners of not-so-new smartphones should check whether their device supports the 'BLE' standard (Bluetooth Low Energy) before considering buying this watch. I had not checked this myself and as a result had to get a new smartphone.... The application available for iOS and Android runs stably and really offers a variety of possibilities to prepare and display the data provided by the watch in various dependencies to each other. Statistical evaluations are certainly one of its strengths. I would like to highlight here only the very good sleep monitoring, which in my opinion is particularly important. It can even show at which time of night which pulse was present. For me, this is particularly important and a main argument for buying this watch: At the touch of a button, an ECG can be recorded at any time, which can then be printed out as a PDF via the app. In case of need, these printouts can simply be taken to the doctor. This avoids the widespread 'presentation effect', where disturbances that occur at home are often no longer detectable at the doctor's office. The smartwatch discussed here does not have a GPS sensor, which is not a disadvantage for me. Firstly, I know where I am anyway, and secondly, I don't have to tell the whole world on the hunt for the ultimate 'like' when, where, how long and how fast I was on the road.... Finally, a brief comment on battery life: According to the manufacturer, the battery should last up to thirty days. I have found that it lasts about three weeks. Of course, the running time depends on the frequency and intensity of the measurements used. Conclusion: Clear purchase recommendation.
February 21, 2023 | anonymous Buy All good, always again February 20, 2023 | anonymous Super satisfied - only one blood pressure measurement is missing My impression of the watch and the app deserves a full 5 stars. It does everything that is indicated really well and the app is also great to use. The possibility of a blood pressure measurement is not indicated. However, this is still important to me, especially since all the necessary sensors for a pulse transit method are already available (at least as far as I understand). Obviously, this is 'only' a software question. Therefore, there is one point deduction.
February 19, 2023 | anonymous Has style and class, very unobtrusive I came from various other smart watches before, including an Apple Watch Series 6 and a Pebble Watch. I have to say that the watch makes a very decent impression. Basically, it has most of the smart watch functions, such as a pedometer, EKG, even blood oxygen, and all on a small round screen. The rest of the watch is relatively inconspicuous, the perfect gadget for fans of the Bauhaus deals and fans of the designer Dieter Rams. However, the biggest plus point is the grandiose long battery life among smart watches. With one charge, you can easily get through a month, which was the deciding factor for me and no other smart watch can honestly compete with that.
February 18, 2023 | anonymous Plausible medical data and chic simple design I've had the watch for a few days. For comparison of health functions, I have: An Amazfit bracelet, the Sense from fitbit, a med. Pulse oximeter and a handheld 1-channel ECG from Beurer. The Scanwatch performs equally or even better than the mentioned devices and can do everything. The ECG is hardly noisy if you keep still. The deviation from the SPO2 of the pulse oximeter is 1% SPO2 and 1 heartbeat. By the way, you can view the clinical study partners in Europe (!). The sleep monitoring works very well, including SPO2 evaluation. Unfortunately, the REM phases are missing as with fitbit. The heart rate measurement on the bike works very well actively. Passively, you should choose a training session beforehand. That's a bit annoying. Compared to fitbit, the manual triggering of an SPO2 measurement is an advantage. The watch also makes a very stable and valuable impression. You can also display WhatsApp messages, calendar entries, etc. on the display. So it's a very useful watch for vital signs that also looks elegant and simple. So if you don't need smartwatch functions like music player, etc., this is the right place.
February 15, 2023 | anonymous Very nice watch, too heavy for me.
The installation was easy and intuitive. Unfortunately, it could not record GPS. Therefore, it is not recommended for people who do outdoor sports.
February 14, 2023 | anonymous Precise, helpful, beautiful I could never have imagined wearing such a precise measuring device 'disguised' in a beautiful watch all the time. Atrial fibrillation as a possible cause of stroke can be detected early, so that continuous use of anticoagulant therapy can be reconsidered. It's great that with the help of SpO2 measurement, snoring information about the effect of possible apnea can be obtained. Surely, the other measurement possibilities stimulate more physical activity. A meaningful side effect for those who are not fitness enthusiasts. And then there's the long battery life of this beautiful hybrid watch. A compliment to the developers! February 13, 2023 | anonymous Good watch, great battery life.
It's working great, gives accurate measurements, easy to install on your phone, long wrist band, easy charging and great battery life. The only thing is that I'm yet to find if and how it can alert you when you have reached a certain BPM. I didn't get an answer from costumer service over email.
February 13, 2023 | anonymous Perfect watch with EKG for health check! Hello, the Withings Scanwatch shows how it's done! A chic watch in at least 2 sizes (unfortunately the 46mm variant for the strong arm is still missing) and with all the functions you need for a health check. The EKG monitoring is great and provides reliable results (including warning for atrial fibrillation). Sit down, relax, activate and wait 30s. The heart rate, sleep rhythm and breathing activity are also reliably checked! With the EKG, the watch does everything you need. The app on the phone is also great and easy to understand. Includes a report for the doctor as a pdf printout. In addition, a long battery life with a single charge of up to 3 weeks. Overall, it can do everything that others should be able to do by now but can't. Something is always missing and especially the EKG. There are 1-2 other manufacturers but either the EKG is only conditionally reliable or the battery only lasts 36 hours. The Withings Scanwatch can do everything a little better. If there was a 46mm version, I would buy a second one too. Note: if you track your breathing activity every night, the battery life will of course be reduced; because the watch tracks permanently over the night. Logical...! Overall, great watch and Withings hit the bull's eye not only with this watch!!bern54 February 12, 2023 | anonymous Withings ScanWatch 42mm Withings ScanWatch 42mmTest Nov.2020Super Design. Con: not readable in the dark.App: OKMeasurement accuracy needs to wait for updates.Battery is excellent!!Unfortunately, it remains with Apple.Score: 3.5Best regards, Bresser February 8, 2023 | anonymous Withings ScanWatch - great watch ***** Watch as described, bought it to monitor AFib. Top in all functions ***** February 7, 2023 | anonymous Poor synchronization Nice watch with good functionality. However, notifications do not appear on the watch when received on the phone. The apps are unlocked under Healthmate, but the watch remains silent when receiving messages. Occasionally, turning off and reassigning app permissions and synchronizing helps. Unfortunately, it only helps for a day at best.
February 7, 2023 | anonymous The only one and the bestest “hybrid” watches on the market Awesome design, good battery life February 7, 2023 | anonymous Classic watch with great smart features Fast and hassle-free delivery. High-quality processing, battery lasts at least 14 days to 4 weeks depending on usage. Very good setup assistant. Perfect interaction with iPhone. Report creation and printing of measurements/recordings.
February 6, 2023 | anonymous Long Battery Life With my usage, it lasts so long that I forget when I last charged it.
February 6, 2023 | anonymous It was a gift ...
I received the ScanWatch as a gift, but I chose it myself. For personal reasons, I was looking for a watch with the ability to write an EKG and stumbled upon the ScanWatch. A stroke of luck for me. It records both EKG and heart rate, oxygen saturation, sleep monitoring, and much more. The operation of the watch and the corresponding app is largely self-explanatory. In addition, the pedometer has motivated me to walk more ... A gain for me! The battery life until the next charge is very good! It does shorten if you choose to monitor your sleep every night, but everyone can decide for themselves which functions are important and which ones are less needed. I can definitely recommend it! February 5, 2023 | anonymous A great watch with good features At first, I ordered the Withings ScanWatch Hybrid Scanwatch Horizon, but it was so heavy and big that I returned it and ordered the Withings ScanWatch Hybrid Smartwatch. This watch is very comfortable for me to wear and is not so heavy. The watch shows me how I spent my day and night. To what extent this is reliable, I would like to explore only through one or the other check by measuring blood pressure. But that fits quite well. I can highly recommend the smartwatch and am thrilled with the battery life.
January 29, 2023 | anonymous Good design, easy operation, enormous battery life Great design, looks like a normal watch. Easy operation, only requires some patience when measuring oxygen levels. Enormous battery life.
January 27, 2023 | anonymous Beautiful functional high tech analog hybrid The scan watch is a great alternative to other smart watches. Definitely has more design appeal. Battery life is good but extremely variable depending on how you decide to use it. Lots of settings to explore. Very comfortable but I upgraded to a leather strap. Sleep tracking works well but it only provides an average spo2 reading which is taken every 30 minutes for 30 seconds. I was under the impression the watch would provide more continuous information about night time spo2 and detect drops etc and show this on a graph, but it does not. Otherwise all the other features are excellent. I particularly enjoy the 0-100 progress dial. Means I can simply glance at it and I know if I've achieved my number of steps for the day. The dial is relevant to whichever workout mode you select and can be customized. Very cool January 26, 2023 | anonymous I really love this watch, and it's helped motivate me to stay on track.
This watch is perfect for my style, being more of a classic analog appearance but having many excellent features for tracking health metrics, and just enough mobile alerts to meet my needs.The silicone band created a red itchy rash the first week or two I was wearing it, but as I continued to clean and ensure it was fit well and dry, the itch and redness disappeared and is no longer a problem.Could also be that I hadn't worn a watch regularly in years, so my skin had to get used to it again.The heart rate monitoring, blood oxygen, and ECG functionality is the best!The sleep tracking is also a fantastic feature that has helped me considerably as well.All of these metrics being measured is nice, but automatic tracking within the mobile app makes it super easy to see what's going on and watch for trends over time.I also purchased Withings body composition scale and blood pressure sleeve.All three devices working in conjuction in the mobile app provide and incredible view of even minor progress towards my health goals, which is what I really needed to motivate me to stay on track.It's easy to get discouraged when you don't immediately see a change in the mirror or even on the scale, but by seeing improvements and changes to body composition, resting heart rates, steo counts, etc... it's a nice reminder that your efforts are paying off towards overall improvements to health!Also I noticed some reviews complained that the hands on the watch face did not glow in the dark, but they actually do!Maybe that's an update since the original release, but I'm very pleased with this watch in all regards.
January 26, 2023 | anonymous Works and looks nice Hubs did a a lot of research and chose this. He likes it and is happy with the purchase. We did order a different band that doesn't have those grip things in it.
January 24, 2023 | anonymous A great alternative to the Apple Watch First of all, the Withings Scanwatch is a normal, 'conservative' round wristwatch. In the model discussed here with a black dial, the 'digital circle' in the upper third of the watch hand field is less noticeable. In this small circle, which can only be read and tracked with good eyesight without glasses, all the information is displayed that makes the Scanwatch a smartwatch. Everything is included: sports modes, stopwatch, timer, etc. but above all, health values are displayed. The Scanwatch displays not only blood pressure and heart rate, but also signs of heart rhythm disorders (atrial fibrillation), which only Fitbit & Applewatch do (as far as I know). Blood pressure & ECG are also included. The ECG is really easy to do. Blood oxygen values are also included and there are special adjustments for various 'workouts' in the sports apps. After a little getting used to, I like the watch every day. The mobile app 'Health Mate' is particularly good, which collects and organizes all sports activities and encourages you to continue daily. The Scanwatch is a real all-round recommendation from me, especially since it is around € 150 cheaper than the cheapest Applewatch at around € 250. The Applewatch is just the real small computer on the wrist, the displays are larger, you have to decide. I just like the watch on my arm, which can also do everything digital, especially in the health sector.
January 23, 2023 | anonymous Super It's just great. What bothers me is that my wrist is too thin and it's too heavy to wear January 22, 2023 | anonymous Beautiful watch with excellent craftsmanship, has all the features most people really need I've had the scanwatch for about 6 months, and I must say, it is still as good as day one. Battery life is so good (2-3 weeks) even with all functions turned on. The watch feels sturdy with excellent material all around. App pairing is smooth and the user interface in the app is clean and easy to navigate.As for fitness tracking, the only thing I wished it had was a GPS. Otherwise, SPO2, step tracking, activity tracking, sleeping tracking, ECG, heart rate monitoring is all there. The heart rate sensor could be a little off sometimes because of only one LED, but that saves a lot of battery life. It's enough data for us common folk unless you're an athlete or need huge amounts of data, which in that case there are more suitable products.Overall, Withings as a company makes great products. I'm a happy owner of six months.
January 22, 2023 | anonymous The watch glass was fogged up from the inside.
The watch glass was fogged up from the inside. This should not happen with a waterproof watch. Visible in the photo on the right side. Too bad. It's going back.
January 21, 2023 | anonymous Robust, unobtrusively beautiful and reliable measurements The title says everything I can say about it. Only occasionally does it need several attempts for the 30-second measurement, but that is probably more due to the body than to the watch January 21, 2023 | anonymous NOT for people with pacemakers....
I would have wished for this note to be at the top of the product description. Then I wouldn't be sad that I had to return the watch. Unfortunately, I only found out about this after installing the app and reading the help topics. Based on the technical data and options known to me before the purchase, all my expectations regarding the product were fulfilled, both regarding the functions of the watch and the app. The setup via the app was done using easily understandable explanations for each individual option. The instructions for using the watch functions and their practical application were also easy to understand. In retrospect, the measurement results seemed plausible to me compared to existing comparative data from medical examinations. The results of the sleep analyses are also informative. From my point of view, there is nothing to complain about regarding the mechanical design of the watch. The height of the case is normal, the (standard) strap is comfortable to wear, the display is easy to read in any light, and the watch (here: in black) looks discreetly elegant on the wrist. It's just a shame about... (see title).
January 20, 2023 | anonymous Stylish and fully functional It is my first smartwatch. I compared and examined the functions and corresponding applications thoroughly before purchasing, so I am satisfied with the functions. What I was most concerned about was the appearance for everyday use. This smartwatch looks like a simple and stylish analog watch. Also, I am satisfied with the battery life as I only need to charge it about once every two weeks.
January 20, 2023 | anonymous Very nice and good Worked perfectly on Christmas Eve January 19, 2023 | anonymous Great compromise between stylish traditional watch and modern smartwatch features Watch looks really nice. So far its been very durable for all day wearing, and the battery life is excellent.You'll definitely want to change the stock band as its far too uncomfortable and not very stylish.The watch takes standard bands so you can mix/match for the occasion. A nice leather band classes up the look nicely, and you can switch out a knit or other less formal for everyday wear and/or exercising.Tracking features are great.Two wish-lists: 1) That it would alert you when the battery was low. 2) There was a stopwatch feature on the watch.Overall really happy with it. Best smartwatch I've owned January 18, 2023 | anonymous Pulse rate, SpO2, ECG.
To monitor heart function January 17, 2023 | anonymous Super Watch I've had several smartwatches, but this watch meets my requirements the best. Long battery life of 3 to 4 weeks. Watch with real hands (AOD). Great vital measurements and activity tracking. Everything I need.
January 15, 2023 | anonymous Super Health-Watch in classic design I especially like the classic design with real hands! The focus of the watch is on health monitoring thanks to its excellent sensors (including blood oxygen level). Other typical smartwatch functions are only rudimentarily available, but I don't even want them. I am very satisfied, also with the battery life of several weeks! January 15, 2023 | anonymous IOS Version is up to date We had an issue with getting imessage IOS notifications. We had to update our IOS to the latest (over version 16) for notification to work.We wished that Withings had a minimum IOS requirements listed on their site.
January 15, 2023 | anonymous A nice fitness watch I have been wearing the watch for 3 months now and I am very satisfied so far. The design was particularly important to me; the watch is quite simple and beautiful. Only on second glance does it become apparent that this is a fitness watch. At the beginning, I was guided through the entire menu via the app, so I was able to quickly make all the settings that were important to me. The operation is simple and intuitive. Technically, the watch fulfills everything it promises and the battery lasts a very long time (I may have had to charge it 3 times in the last few months) January 12, 2023 | anonymous Keeps what it promises Product is as desired, easy to set up and use, highly recommended January 10, 2023 | anonymous Beautiful watch with additional features I have been interested in the ScanWatch since it has a "real" crown. For me, this makes it a wristwatch and it is also easy to operate. Beauty is subjective, but it still looks good next to my Nomos Tetra and can do much more if I want it to. What I want are occasional checks of some basic values, especially heart rate over 24 hours under different conditions, and some encouragement to get moving and stay active. It works quite well, but those who need more accurate and reliable values for statistics should buy an Apple Watch. The sleep detection often makes me smile and the stair climbing is probably calibrated on the Eiffel Tower - my first tracker that cannot do this in a 1F house. The heart rate monitor and pedometer are okay. The app, including synchronization with the Health app, is very good. On request, you get a small evaluation and advice and almost feel "coached". All of this together is a likable overall package for me, and those who like this minimalist watch get much more than, for example, a chronograph, without standing out with too many controls. P.S. The soft silicone band, which is sometimes criticized, is my first choice, especially since you have to wear the watch tightly for accurate heart rate measurement, especially during sports, which can leave pressure marks - even more so with a stiffer band.
January 10, 2023 | anonymous Amazing ... just need it in black (but I'm keeping it) This is an amazing watch. Superior build quality. Industry leading accuracy (and FDA approved). Simple design ... It's a 'health' watch, not a 'health and fitness' watch, so know that. While it tracks steps, it'd be hard to use in a full workout, I'd think. The included app works with other Withings products (BP cuff, etc) for a comprehensive system. And the battery life is great!However, I just couldn't wear it. It felt too conspicuous on my wrist. If the bezel were straight black like the steel-HR, it'd be great... but as-is, it looks like a 'business casual' watch and it not hip/cool in the slightest and stands out just a bit too much. Also, the crown is too big and easily triggered by wrist movement, but that's a minor deal (but could be remedied by moving it to the 2-o'clock positionNote to Withings: I'll be watching for a black version (maybe with a flat crystal?) ... and I like this one so much, I'll hang on to it even if it gets minimal wear. but the Amazfit GTR-4 will be the daily-wear watch.
January 10, 2023 | anonymous Awesome watch with great features! I have researched this watch for months before my purchase, and I am so pleased with it. Not only is it so functional for my needs, but it is beautifully made and is no way clunky, ortoo large to wear. You would think it was just a beautiful ,normal watch. Even physician friends were impressed with its accuracy, and easy operation. I am so happy I bought this watch, as It gives me better control of my health, and keeps me health minded. Definitely a plus in my book Withings! Thank you for making such a useful, and pretty device! January 8, 2023 | anonymous good upgrade from previous watch I had a Nokia watch the last 5 years, which was before Withings bought them. I waited a year for the new scan watch came out to make sure the bugs were fixed. I am very impressed with the data I am getting and had no issues with any of the options. I like the bigger text on the watch screen and the ability to make it brighter, so I can see it better. I have read lots of reviews on Amazon and I did not have any problems.
January 8, 2023 | anonymous I think they're great...
has everything I need, and doesn't annoy me with notifications or Google...
January 6, 2023 | anonymous Great Watch Hybrid is on everyone's lips these days, and here too: The Withings hybrid watch. Like it! The description is spot on, it looks good, everything works as expected, and it seems (nowhere explicitly stated) to be nickel-free; at least I don't react.
January 6, 2023 | anonymous I would buy this again I had heart bypass surgery a little over a year ago and wanted an easy way to measure my heart rate and ECG. This watch does both in addition to a number of other functions. And I like that it looks like an attractive watch instead of a high-tech device and has a battery life that is so long. I would buy this watch again.
January 6, 2023 | anonymous Functioning perfectly. Super accurate results. Highly recommended. Gladly again Fast delivery. Price-performance ratio is good. Helps a lot to check sleep quality, oxygen in the blood, and EKG. Highly recommended January 5, 2023 | anonymous Scan 2nd. Because I like it.
Withings is the 4th product, including Pop, HRsport, Scan, and Scan. I think I can be satisfied by focusing on the following two points. The first point to be aware of is water. It is better to avoid operating the crown in situations where it is constantly in contact with water. When I repeatedly operated the crown in situations where it was constantly in contact with water, it condensed. When I contacted support, they only recommended drying, and in my case, it was not eligible for repair (the same as other reviews). The first Scan is sealed. The second point to be aware of is that if there is a period (several days in my perception) when it is not synchronized with the app, the time will be off. If it is synchronized with the app, it will be automatically corrected. If you remember that it is not synchronized, you just have to take care of it. I considered other watches, but I bought the second Scan. It has been a year and there is no condensation. The sapphire glass on the windshield is scratch-free and stress-free, and the notifications are not intrusive, only telling me what I need to know about my activities. The ease of charging, the good appearance, and the gratitude for taking care of me are the reasons for continued use.
January 5, 2023 | anonymous Good Watch Looks like a good normal watch. The functions are great.
January 4, 2023 | anonymous Great device! First impression is great, only the weight and the somewhat bulky exterior are a bit of a nuisance, but that doesn't lead to any deductions. The watch itself is high-quality and the measured values seem reliable and can be used as a good indication. The app is a bit 'fiddly' at the beginning until you have found/understood all settings/functions, but there is also a lot of 'thoughtfulness' here.
January 2, 2023 | anonymous Back cover comes off Purchased at Bic Camera, where extended warranty is available. The texture as a watch is high, and it is easy to understand incoming calls with vibration and LCD display. I purchased a separate Milanese type band and used it comfortably. After about a year and a half of use, the back cover came off and I requested repair from Bic Camera, but it was returned as unrepairable. It seems that Bic Camera no longer handles it, and it has been replaced with a smartwatch from another manufacturer in the same price range. I want to use this good watch for a long time, but since even minor repairs cannot be done, I have to use it as disposable. If it breaks during the warranty period, let's buy it with a feeling of luck.
January 2, 2023 | anonymous Top Watch The watch is easy to use, the battery lasts for 3 weeks. And medically very valuable.
December 31, 2022 | anonymous Smartwatch with high CP value The appearance design is very luxurious, the battery life is also very good, the price is also great, worth buying December 29, 2022 | anonymous Withings ScanWatch Hybrid A slightly different smartwatch but just right for me+ Long battery life+ stylish design if you buy the overpriced metal strap+ you have to like the shape of the notifications- frequent errors in the SP02 measurement- workout tracing starts automatically without GPS, it works manually, let's hope that further software updates will improve everything December 28, 2022 | anonymous The watch is good, the app not so much As a basic smartwatch I like it both as a good looking watch and for the health functions. I've had a couple of other smartwatches and like the Withings a lot more.However, the app, which is needed for using the watch, is not very well done. In particular, the distance measurements for walking, biking, etc. are pretty much useless. Because it gets discrete GPS fixes which have some jitter, it thinks you're walking a very jagged path so it winds up being about 10% longer than the actual path. It should smooth the path to get a more accurate reading.Be aware that the scanning function for automatic afib detection isn't available in the US. The manual cardiogram function is very easy to use, so it's not that big a deal.
December 28, 2022 | anonymous excellent smartwatch excellent smartwatch December 26, 2022 | anonymous Alle Funktionen sind sehr gut und ziemlich korrekt. You Die App ist übersichtlich. Man müsste die Schrittlänge einstellen können. Auch die Funktion der SpO2 Messung stimmt mit meinem Pulsoximeter überein und war für mich der Hauptgrund für den Kauf. Akkulaufzeit hervorragend!Würde diese Uhr immer wieder kaufen.
December 26, 2022 | anonymous Nice EKG watch, unfortunately not a sports watch Nice watch with very good wrist sensor (EKG and pulse). When wearing it at night, the watch doesn't feel good for me. As a fitness watch, it can't replace my Fenix 6 at all. So the only plus is the EKG, everything else is done better by Garmin.
December 22, 2022 | anonymous Suitable for me I bought the watch as a replacement for my Steel HR, which I have been using for 5 years now. So I can make a little comparison here. The Steell HR is still running, by the way. I just wanted an upgrade. My sports are swimming, hiking and cycling. I am an active person, but not a competitive athlete. Design: I am a fan of classic watches that simply show the time when you don't ask them anything else. That makes them perfect and I really wear them on every occasion. I just don't want to look like I'm on my way to the Iron Man at some events. The watch looks quite valuable, which I also like. Functions: Pulse, breathing, SPO2 saturation, sleep, and EKG are interesting functions for me. This gives me feedback on my health and my performance in swimming, hiking and cycling. By the way, the watch always recognizes the sports automatically. So I don't have to activate anything. For me, this is important because I don't have to think about activating any function before I start. I usually don't use notifications for SMS, WhatsApp, etc. But when hiking or cycling, it can be quite useful if you have the smartphone in your backpack and don't want to take it out for every signal tone. I almost never use connected GPS because it drains the smartphone battery faster. But of course, it is also an interesting function if you want to display your pulse together with the distance. Battery: With the above-mentioned functions, the watch runs for about 16 days on one battery charge. If you turn off the automatic SPO2 measurement, it will run for almost 4 weeks. Comparison ScanWatch with Steel HR: Larger OLED display, much nicer, easy-to-read, luminous dial, sleep detection not significantly better, pulse measurement is better, operation is just as good, and then there are the new features: SPO2 seems a bit pessimistic to me, EKG is sensational interesting, breathing monitoring works, but I can't judge it. Bracelet: Original rubber band is comfortable, but a bit thin for my taste. Anyway, if you wear it constantly, you have to replace it after a year anyway. I then like to take a more stable rubber band. Conclusion: The Steel HR was a loyal 7x24 companion for me for years, opening up interesting insights. The ScanWatch does many things better and of course has other interesting functions that I also like to use. I find the operation very good. I don't have to solve any puzzles and can understand the functions. Otherwise, the watch does many things automatically. The app: Fits well with the overall concept of the watch and has been improved over the years. The professional athlete would probably miss a lot. But for me as an ordinary person, everything fits perfectly.
December 22, 2022 | anonymous Most stylish smartwatch out there.What all smartwatches should desire to be style-wise I love hybrid smartwatches, and I am in love with traditional looking watches, but want at least some limited smart features (like seeing who is calling/messaging me, and some fitness tracking).The blue and rose gold if gorgeous on the watch.The smart features are pretty good too.Having a physical dial to interact with on the watch if far better than my previous Garmin Vivomove which had a very poor touchscreen interface that doesn't work well when you are sweating at the gym December 21, 2022 | anonymous Great hybrid smartwatch The device looks good and works good as well.
December 20, 2022 | anonymous Top seller Looks really good unfortunately it was broken so I can't rate the watch myself but everything else went smoothly top seller December 20, 2022 | anonymous Fragile Fragile, mostly accurate December 20, 2022 | anonymous Great Watch Great and beautiful watch, the functions are easy to understand through the app, well and safely packaged, too bad that the price on Amazon constantly varies otherwise I would have ordered another one.
December 18, 2022 | anonymous Recommend buying the watch on offer Good: Design; Comfort; Readability even in the dark; Easy operation. Bad: With all monitoring functions turned on, the battery lasts 2-3 days. Sleep without REM analysis; Manual measurement too often unsuccessful. According to the network, an update is coming, then there may be a better rating.
December 18, 2022 | anonymous Watch Unfortunately, it does not work properly December 15, 2022 | anonymous Delivers what it promises, not cheap, but quality and functionality I can only recommend this Scanwatch. Top in function, quality really good. Functions with the APP flawless. Some say EKG is not measured, I also thought so, but you have to turn it on in the APP on your mobile phone, and even more functions. Conclusion: Thumbs up, I can only recommend it.
December 13, 2022 | anonymous Elegant watch that tracks health or vis versa This is an excellent health tracker with an easy to use app. It tracks most significant stats and performs as an ecg as well. The small screen is just large enough to read easily and simple to navigate. The design is more of an elegant watch than a fitness tracker. In fact I get compliments on how it looks from people who have no idea what it does. It's become my favorite watch and fitness tracker.
December 12, 2022 | anonymous Okay for the price with minor flaws Unfortunately, the display is partially difficult to read due to the curved glass and light reflections. WRIST OXIMETRY initially had constant unsuccessful measurements until I stopped placing my hand on the watch. PEDOMETER is also inaccurate, but I will continue to test it further.
December 11, 2022 | anonymous Excellent battery life and great performance I am a former Apple Watch 4 owner, but moved to Withings because I was tired charging that watch every single day.I bought the 42mm black dial Withings because the high contrast of hands and watch face is easy to read.Only the 42mm version has lume on the hands for night reading.Even with my poor close vision I can read the time in total darkness.This watch does a good job of tracking workouts (including geo tracking via my phone) and sleep patterns. I like the alarm function because the gentle wrist vibration doesn't disturb my bed partner.The HealthMate mobile app has a nice display of key information.It's worth the time to go through the app tutorials and go deep into the settings to get everything set up the way you want.It syncs seamlesslywith the Apple Health and Strava apps.Battery life has been excellent.I track workouts and sleep daily and after ten full days of use, the battery has just under 50% remaining. I wouldn't expect to get the 'up to' 30 days on a charge, but it is a solid two week battery.If you track breathing during sleep, expect a pretty substantial battery drain.I turned that function off.The watch is very comfortable to wear.The anti-reflective coating doesn't to the best job, but it's not a big deal.Buy this watch if you want a fitness tracker that looks stylish and doesn't need frequent charging.You will give up the full functionality of an Apple Watch, but if you can live with that, this is a great choice.
December 11, 2022 | anonymous Gut Gut December 10, 2022 | anonymous Still top after over a year of use I bought the watch in the summer of 2021 after my old watch (Steel HR Sport) had condensation under the glass. Unfortunately, the support from Withings was non-existent, but the dealer replaced the watch within the warranty. So far, the watch runs without any problems and needs to be charged very rarely. Even with daily wear, the watch still has no scratches and runs as expected. The only thing that bothered me compared to the previous model was the included strap. I sweated too much during sports, so I ordered the old sports strap of the SteelHR, which was great and the straps can be easily replaced. I am still very satisfied and hope that if I need support again, it will respond faster or at all. Unfortunately, I still miss the ability to record bouldering. Climbing seems to require a lot of breaks. But that is more of a problem with the app than with the watch.
December 9, 2022 | anonymous Sensor technology up to date I chose this Withings smartwatch because it can record ECGs, is clinically tested according to the manufacturer, and because the battery has a comparatively long life. A small charging station is included in the delivery, which must be connected to a USB-A power supply not included, and a simple felt case. The dial of the watch with conventional hands glows weakly at night and is also easy to read for older people. However, not the very small round display, for which I need glasses. The silicone strap must be tightened firmly to ensure the proper functioning of the watch - even at night, if you want to control your breathing rhythm while sleeping. This is not always pleasant. If you sweat under the strap, frequent cleaning is required, otherwise skin irritation may occur. Rinsing under running water has worked well for the watch so far. The watch's measuring functions can mostly be started using the crown. However, for evaluations and further configuration, you need the app and the smartphone. The app doesn't seem as structured to me as I would like it to be, and is sometimes overloaded. Like most fitness apps, it is extremely curious and annoying with constant requests for data that has not been entered. This does not necessarily create trust in the manufacturer's cloud for me. There are some functions that I like. First of all, there is the ECG. Although the recorded curve is far from the results of a professional multi-channel device, it allows at least a rough detection of the heart rhythm. Atrial fibrillation can be detected and generates a warning in the app. However, this also happened while shaving with an electric razor - I very much doubt that I had rhythm disturbances at exactly that time. Although the sleep monitoring provides interesting insights, it often has to be edited, which does not lead to trust in the recorded results. Often, falling asleep is recorded hours too late or waking up too early. On the other hand, nocturnal waking phases seem to correspond quite well with one's own memory. The O2 value in the blood is always displayed about 2% lower than with a comparatively used finger sensor. I cannot objectively evaluate the analysis of breathing disorders during sleep due to a lack of comparable measurements. With regard to the fitness functions, the watch does not differ significantly from others, here too the automatic recognition of activities is rather poor and often has to be corrected in the app. Even with manual control, the watch shows significantly more calories burned than, for example, an ergometer with parallel measurement. The step detection seems to be relatively reliable, differing only slightly from a separately worn pedometer. The floor detection (walking up/down stairs) also works quite well, although the watch itself has no GPS and is not constantly connected to the smartphone. The battery life depends on the frequency of use of the measuring functions and is about one week for me - I am satisfied with that. Many of the weaknesses identified could certainly be eliminated by extreme tightening of the watch strap, removing body hair under the watch, applying contact gel, etc. But who wants to do that? Sensor technology remains a weak point of all smartwatches. And it must be admitted that Withings has this problem better under control than most other providers. But it is still far from being perfectly solved.
December 9, 2022 | anonymous Elegant Hybrid Watch with strong features Long battery life, unfortunately often accidentally reset by long pressing the button. If defined as a shortcut for measurement, at least no accidental reboot December 9, 2022 | anonymous Unfortunately, one flaw no blood pressure measurement After the purchase, I realized that the app supposedly also realizes a blood pressure measurement via the watch, but this is not the case December 8, 2022 | anonymous Long lasting battery - may be the best solution inhybrid watch market I used before Withings steel watch and was quite happy with the choice. Now I bought scanwatch - no disappointment - just a joy because of the better user experience. Thanks December 8, 2022 | anonymous Withings for heart diseases Helps significantly with heart diseases, especially with rhythm disorders December 7, 2022 | anonymous Better than Fitbit Excellent battery life and still working well after 2 years of use (numerous Fitbits of mine have died after about 1 year) December 5, 2022 | anonymous Does what it's supposed to do So far I'm satisfied with the watch. Long-term experiences will show if the watch is really useful.
December 4, 2022 | anonymous Great Stealth Smart Watch After being diagnosed with intermittent AFIB, I wanted a watch that can monitor pulse rate and do a simple quick ECG.I didn't need all the extra phone and connectivity features in the Apple watch, so I picked the ScanWatch.Works great for what I need it to do.Looks like a classy dress watch and doesn't shout 'I AM A SMART WATCH' to casual observers.The iPhone app is easy to use and informative.The stock 'rubber' strap that comes on the watch was uncomfortable for me, so I ordered a Speidel Twist-O-Flex (Black, 16-22mm, Regular length, Curved ends).100% improvement in comfort, looks, and easy ON/OFF! December 1, 2022 | anonymous Great watch for people with health issues!! We gave our dad this watch for his 60th birthday because he has health problems. With the watch, he can better monitor his body and its functions and manage his health. The price is high, but what wouldn't one do to feel relatively good. Thank you.
November 30, 2022 | anonymous Great disappointment It's not that the product is bad, but the information and connectivity. It was not mentioned that the ScanWatch can only be operated with the latest Health Mate version. Since I still have an old phone with Android 6 'Marshmallow' on which the latest Health Mate version 4.10.1 runs, but the watch requires the latest update, I cannot operate the watch. 240,- Euro for the old Fritz. ;-( November 28, 2022 | anonymous Why have hands if they don't show accurate time? I bought this smartwatch because I wanted a product that was close in design to a normal watch, with real hands. Unfortunately, there is a problem with the Scanwatch, as it has hands but they are very regularly misaligned. Therefore, reading the time from the hands is not reliable! By now, it has become a habit to also press the button to read the time digitally and thus be sure that you have a correct time indication. The problem is known and the app allows you to adjust the hands again. And here is the next point of criticism, as the hands can only be aligned via the app. A smarter and more satisfying solution would be to be able to do this at least via the watch setup - a software update should suffice here. For these two reasons, there are also two stars deducted. From a design point of view, it is actually a good concept, and the battery life is good compared to other smartwatches. The only minor design flaw in my opinion is that the watch is designed for 20mm straps, which is a bit too narrow for the case size. A 22mm band would result in a more balanced design. The menu control is easy to use.
November 24, 2022 | anonymous I like my watch Simply superb November 24, 2022 | anonymous Beautiful watch Very good watch battery lasts 1 week November 23, 2022 | anonymous Recommended Good battery life of real 2 weeks! Without all the frills with pictures or phone, that only costs battery power. The data is quite good and accurate. At first, I hesitated because of the price, but the watch is really one of the best! It's really worth it! November 22, 2022 | anonymous Great watch for people who don’t like to charge often My first watch lasted me 4 years (the hour hand quit working after I sanded some floors), so I bought a second. I love the watch because I only have to charge once a month, it’s durable, and can be worn in shower/swimming. I barely take mine off other than to clean it/my wrist. This time around I did buy a screen protector. My old one was pretty scratched up, but again, I wore it for everything.
November 19, 2022 | anonymous The watch does what it promises Very good and accurate ECG, easy printing November 17, 2022 | anonymous Unable to connect to Galaxy s22 Actually a nice watch. Unfortunately, it became defective after a short time and cannot connect to the smartphone. Deleted the account, created a new one, and reset the watch. All unsuccessful. I will order a new watch and test it again. Until then, only two stars. It would be desirable to have telephone support in German so that errors can possibly be fixed with a specialist.
November 16, 2022 | anonymous Beautiful but it thinks I’m always on the bike I’ve had 2 different scanwatches and both always think I’m on a bike ride. I could be dead asleep and it says I cycled for an hour. Super frustrating. I love my watch really just for its appearance so I’m waiting on someone to come up with something I like to replace it.
November 16, 2022 | anonymous Scan Watch not working anymore After a few weeks, Scan Watch is no longer working. Frequent communication breakdown with Health App. Failure of functions such as EKG and SPO2, etc. Several attempts to repair Scan Watch in collaboration with Withings Service have failed. I want to return the Scan Watch. What should I do? Please send me the return documents.
November 11, 2022 | anonymous EKG Watch with Style Really beautiful with the stainless steel case and curved glass. Also not too big. The functions mostly correspond to a health watch. I especially appreciate the detailed sleep analysis which seems to be quite accurate. It's a shame that there is no integrated GPS available for outdoor training. Without a smartphone, it's not possible! The long battery life is also worth mentioning positively. The classic design makes it an everyday watch. Highly recommended for minimalists with high standards.
November 9, 2022 | anonymous ECG Functionality I purchased it from US Amazon because I wanted ECG and SAS diagnostic functions. However, when setting up using iPhone, I was worried that the ECG function might be restricted in the Japanese app store, so I created an ID for the US app store and was able to use it with full functionality. Maybe if you buy it on Japanese Amazon, you can display ECG by setting it up on the US app store! November 8, 2022 | anonymous One of the best health monitors with an ECG function Sleeping monitoring and ECG monitoring keeps an eye your health 24/7 - every day and night of the year.
November 5, 2022 | anonymous Inaccurate.
I sleep like the deadfor 10 hours and according to withings, I haven't slept all night. I still use Sleep Cycle on my phone and expected the watch to be far better. Sleep is pretty simple. Not sure I care to spend $300 on a watch that has not been accuate once in 30 nights.Update: in the past week, there have been some significant software updates. The watch seems to knownow when I am sleeping and it has picked up other things that I hadn't seen before. So, I'm hoping that it keeps getting better.
November 5, 2022 | anonymous Beautiful sports watch I already used the previous model and I am just as satisfied with the new one. It does exactly what it should, doesn't look like a fitness watch, and has a long battery life (about 3-4 weeks) November 4, 2022 | anonymous Sport equipment and watch, what I wished for The heart rate is displayed with a delay, but seems to be accurate. Otherwise, the watch is okay.
November 3, 2022 | anonymous Simple and very good! I've used various smartwatches so far, but this might be the best! With smartwatches, there is a momentary gap between raising your arm and the screen lighting up, or it doesn't light up even when you raise it, which is frustrating. Actually, I didn't use such vital signs or exercise, I just wanted to know the notifications, so I was looking for an analog watch that could notify me, and I found this one. It looks simple and there is no discomfort whether you use it for business or private use. This is a review just after I received it, so I don't know about charging or app compatibility, but I know that notifications for Line and phone calls come, so it's enough! The watch hands are accurate because they are linked to the smartphone, and it's great that it can be charged instead of replacing the battery! If I had to mention a bad point, it would be that the contact when charging feels a bit off. It's okay because it charges properly, but it would have been perfect if it could be charged more smoothly.
November 1, 2022 | anonymous Sophisticated and classy Watch is great. Went from a 100% smartwatch fossil that did everything possible and because of that battery life was horrible and the UI was nearly unusable. This is so much nicer, looks super clean, battery lasts forever, and everything I do is super responsive. The data is so in depth it's pretty cool, all though I assume most health trackers have some of the same points but I definitely have no regrets. The one thing I was it could do is ring your phone if it's lost similar to find my phone with other android watches.
October 31, 2022 | anonymous Good purchase This is my first smartwatch and I am almost satisfied. First of all, the battery life is amazing. In my case, I charge it about once every three weeks. If I had to charge it every day, I might find it too much of a hassle and stop using it. The feature that checks my sleep status at night is also very useful. It reminds me to pay attention to my sleep, which is always a concern for me. And above all, the fact that it has an analog watch in addition to the digital one was the deciding factor for me to buy this watch. Garmin also has a smartwatch with an analog watch, but I found an article in the Amazon review section that said the analog and digital watches were not synchronized. This watch is synchronized and can even adjust the minute hand subtly. Two hands are enough for me, and the 38mm black dial version has a sophisticated design that I am convinced was the right choice. The downside is that there is no detailed instruction manual in Japanese. There is a basic operating manual, but some details are not included. There are some parts that I can figure out by playing with it, but there are still some unknowns, and I get frustrated sometimes. However, overall, I would give it four stars.
October 30, 2022 | anonymous Fair Fair October 29, 2022 | anonymous Very good smartwatch, optimal health functions, perfectly coordinated app, long battery life Very good smartwatch with optimal health functions, perfectly coordinated app and very long battery life, easy to use, extensive app with very good evaluations, with a beautiful watch design. Perfect if you are looking for very good health functions. With the app and other devices from Withings, you get a good overall picture of your values, with the possibility of transmitting the values to the doctor.
October 28, 2022 | anonymous The ScanWatch Hybrid Smartwatch with ECG, heart rate sensor and oximeter detected AFib in me Since my general practitioner advised me to keep an eye on my blood pressure and I already had a good blood pressure monitor from Beurer, I also purchased this Withings ScanWatch Hybrid Smartwatch with ECG, heart rate sensor and oximeter. Already on the second day after receiving the watch, it detected AFib in me. I immediately informed my general practitioner and an ECG with him confirmed the AFib. Already the next day, my heartbeat could be brought back to normal function by an electrical impulse in the clinic at Gesundbrunnen. This purchase was absolutely right for me!!! October 25, 2022 | anonymous Very satisfied After about 2 years with the ScanWatch, I can only recommend the product. The ScanWatch looks good, has always worked to my satisfaction and has also always motivated me to stay active.
October 23, 2022 | anonymous Very satisfied No annoying daily charging, only every few weeks, which is very pleasant. Works reliably and does exactly everything as described.
October 22, 2022 | anonymous So far, I am very satisfied For me, oxygen saturation is important - it works accurately.
October 22, 2022 | anonymous Top Watch Even after a year, I am more than satisfied with the watch! The battery life lasts about 20-30 days (without alarm, etc.). However, with constant monitoring of heart rate at night, the watch only lasts about 10 days. That's why I turned it off. The functions are more than practical. You can also connect with other Withings watch wearers on Facebook as motivation to take more steps. The watch makes a good impression and does not scratch. I am simply satisfied! October 20, 2022 | anonymous Completely satisfied A beautiful classic watch without any frills. Setting it up was easy and it is mostly self-explanatory. Text messages are more readable than on any smartwatch I had before. I can recommend it to anyone who does not primarily need it as a sports watch.
October 19, 2022 | anonymous Like A successful and great invention. I like it and it does what I expected from it. Unfortunately, when measuring blood pressure, I had problems. The measurement showed many times that the blood pressure is normal. Since I have been wearing the watch for over a month, I wanted to return it, but it is not possible because it can only be worn for one month and no returns are accepted after that. That's what you call a warranty.
October 19, 2022 | anonymous No automated AFib notification in the United States I like this watch, but it's my first and only smart watch. I have had some problems with the app, but online support has generally been responsive and helpful. It basically works as promised. Some research of the literature supports that the ScanWatch ECG is about as good as the other watch-based devices and will signal any AFib AFTER you take an ECG. I'm disappointed that the watch DOES NOT have automated AFib detection notifications or heart rate notifications in the US. These features are not yet approved by the FDA. You have to read the fine print to figure this out. If you need these features, then you need an Apple Watch. But that requires an iPhone and I'm not going there. I agree with others that the Steps seem to be off, but I almost always carry my phone (for music or podcasts) and the GPS provides a reliable measure of distance covered. I'm not worried about a specific number of steps, so I think the watch is plenty good to show my effort/performance over time. I like the looks and battery life is reasonable (weeks, not 30d). The sleep tracking is not perfect, but it has helped me understand and track my sleep quality (my opinion). When the watch says I had 50% deep sleep, I can tell that I'm more rested than the many nights I have with lower numbers. And it records heart rate during the night, but I'm not sure it can pick up short-term palpitations. We'll see. If you feel something, you can always take an ECG since it's on your wrist! I think this DATA will help me figure out how to get a better night's sleep. The watch literature says it's not guaranteed to work over two years, so consider paying for product insurance if you want more than that. I consider it a cost worth paying to track heart health and sleep.
October 19, 2022 | anonymous The daily control for the heart.
Great product, many options.The accuracy for sports is not well to register the distance (the difference between this product and the Suunto that I use is big, when counting kilometers).I am using this monitor for more than 5 months, and in the last 2 months the mobile app has failed many times for the sleep tracking, also the heart rate tracking daily (looks like lost the communications between the mobile app and the monitor). After all, it is good for the health control.
October 17, 2022 | anonymous Is it already broken? For some reason, SETUP is displayed and nothing happens, with a cross mark. The smartphone also shows that it is connected to the device, but it remains connected forever. Is it already broken? October 16, 2022 | anonymous Very helpful purchase as a watch and for health Very good explanation of how to use it, good features, elegant watch, good explanations in the app October 15, 2022 | anonymous Amazing Love this thing it does everything you need in a smart watch, always works, and the battery lasts FOREVER October 14, 2022 | anonymous Highly recommended Great smartwatch with many features and the look of a high-quality normal wristwatch. Very long battery life, including ECG function with the possibility to export the results as PDF.
October 13, 2022 | anonymous Comfortable, stylish, and works great Not very fond of the silicone band but all of the features are great. Seems to be very accurate and the app is easy to read and understand. I would purchase another one for a loved one.
October 13, 2022 | anonymous Wrong time - Good EKG If I don't regularly open the app on my phone and synchronize the tracker, the time is already wrong after a few days (see picture). A no-go. Something like this should happen automatically in the background. EKG function has delivered good results for corona-related heart rhythm disorders.
October 12, 2022 | anonymous Loved the watch for 22 months...then it started fogging, back fell off and crown stopped responding I really liked this watch. I didn't want an obtrusive watch like a full smart watch but I wanted the ECG (even though it isn't formally approved in Canada). It has a 2 year warranty now, but not when I bought it but I won't be buying a new one. Even with a two year warranty I would barely be on the right side of the time. Two years for a watch to be falling apart is inexcusable. I have traditional watches that have lasted 10-15 years. I take care of my watches but this just seems to have planned obsolescence written all over it. It looks great and performs great until it breaks. A little research showed me as not the only one to lose the back of the watch. The one benefit of the back falling off? The fogging stopped, but it is obviously not even a little bit resistant now.

October 7, 2022 | F.S.

Solid, classic hybrid watch.
Improve precision of the hands when setting. Second hand.
October 7, 2022 | Marc Reliable, accurate, long battery life, beautiful The ScanWatch has proven that Withings products work reliably. The design is pleasantly understated. The purchase of additional Withings products in the future is not ruled out.
October 7, 2022 | Hans-Jürgen Still clock The appearance is the first priority because it is not immediately recognizable as a smart watch, battery available for up to 25 days and many activity options October 7, 2022 | Roedermerker Balance between optics and utility Having heart rate and EKG in such a beautiful watch is great! However, the heart rate measurement while walking is unfortunately poor and not usable (often much higher when compared to a reliable secondary device).
October 7, 2022 | Kai Querbeet I like the simple clear appearance. I would like a display for body temperature.
October 7, 2022 | Horst Watch with many functions Interesting functions that can be read through the app.

Gut Wristbands could be better higher time accuracy October 7, 2022 | Kurt Opinion Analysis, e.g. pulse, in the app should be more accurate October 7, 2022 | TR Very good watch! It would be useful to have blood pressure measurement. Unfortunately, the watch keeps showing that I have been cycling, but it's not true. The sensitivity of the detection should be revised here.
October 7, 2022 | GWE Super beautiful and yet functional watch The design is great, you can't tell it's a fitness watch. Some winter sports could still be added (cross-country skiing, curling).
October 7, 2022 | Nina Stylish - no colorful 'mouse cinema' Does everything it promises. I miss the option to recognize longer standing and to start a workout without a phone and record it.

The heart rate monitor measures incorrectly Except for the heart rate function, I find the watch very good. I also have the scale.
October 7, 2022 | cfw The scale keeps running and running...
The best argument is the long battery life and the fully automatic detection of sports - really top October 7, 2022 | Dirk Excellent companion Can always rely on watch and data. Very good battery life. Occasionally compare measurements with the doctor to evaluate the results.
October 7, 2022 | Michael B.
Reliable and elegant Looks good, the records work reliably and no one notices that it is a smartwatch.
October 7, 2022 | TS ScanWatch Overall, I am very satisfied. The only thing that bothers me about the sleep analysis is that lying still is counted as sleep. Currently, I find the sleep analysis of the Apple Watch to be more accurate.

October 7, 2022 | Gerhard Multifunctional health and fitness tracker The long battery life is great. It would be desirable if blood pressure could also be measured and sugar levels could be entered. I also use the upper arm blood pressure monitor October 7, 2022 | Doc. Michael Top product at a fair price In addition to the ScanWatch, I also use the smart scale Body Cardio, both complement each other very well and the combination of the two devices with the HealthApp on my smartphone is great October 7, 2022 | Peter Robust watch with great features Button lock would be good. Recognize movement while swimming. Detect active calories. Measure temperature October 7, 2022 | Sven M.
Long battery life, inaccurate pedometer Long battery life. Pedometer and Bluetooth connection could be improved.
October 7, 2022 | A.Selent Beautiful Watch The sleek design of the ScanWatch (38mm) immediately caught my attention when I was searching. I use the watch in conjunction with a Body Cardio and a BPM Connect.

the data from the watch i blood pressure monitor scale and thermometer all from Withings October 7, 2022 | Bettina Long battery life Good connection stability to mobile phone, very good battery life, health report of the app should be configurable October 7, 2022 | Alex Good, but room for improvement When everything works, the ScanWatch is good. Occasionally, sleep is not recorded or recorded incompletely. If Bluetooth could be turned off, the watch would be perfect.
October 7, 2022 | Horschte The watch has a very long battery life and is Visually appealing. Improvement: shorter strap length for slim wrists, so that the watch fits well and measures accurately.
October 7, 2022 | TLA Alles super, except not waterproof Waterproof October 7, 2022 | Moni Reliable and robust I like the quality of the case and the sapphire glass. I use the sports functions and occasionally the notifications. The watch could be a bit more compact and lighter.
October 7, 2022 | Jens F Long battery life Navigation is missing October 7, 2022 | Lomugolf Atrial fibrillation is not always displayed The watch looks great, is not immediately recognizable as a functional watch. The EKG should be improved. Often does not detect atrial fibrillation. Especially during tachycardia.

Nordic walking is missing in the activity October 7, 2022 | Hothe good health monitoring Very good health monitoring, not suitable for sports activities.

October 7, 2022 | Mick Unreliable display Display often incorrect When atrial fibrillation is indicated, the message 'Normal sinus curve' appears upon verification October 7, 2022 | Dieter Good battery, data quality generally okay I really like the design - analog dial.

The fact that it can also monitor my sleep is a positive side effect for me, although it has shortened my sleep in two nights.
October 7, 2022 | Klaus H.
Oxygen in focus I think monitoring blood oxygen is good. I would find an alarm helpful if the value goes below a certain level.
October 7, 2022 | Steinkopf Interesting Insights I use a watch and a scale. Overall, it forms a good picture of my physical condition. Interestingly, the data also reflect minor issues (e.g. a small infection) in me October 7, 2022 | Stefanie Very good but...
This watch could be perfect if there was customer support. The era of disposable tools for the slightest problem is over.
October 7, 2022 | Philippe The right balance It's a real watch, the notifications are convenient. I also use the Withings scale. Too bad it can't be used as a heart rate sensor with another application.

October 7, 2022 | Schado Super autonomy The whole is good, only the activity tracker does not differentiate between 'cycling' and 'walking' October 7, 2022 | Thierry30 Not bad, but could do better Discreet, good battery life, sensors fairly accurate overall except for step count October 7, 2022 | PikniK Elegant watch: classicism and high tech First of all, its appearance: beautiful watch, and easy access to data such as ECG or sleep tracking or SP02. One regret: no V02 max October 7, 2022 | JacT Simple data, perfect quality, minimalist style Like some other health watches, I would like menstrual cycle tracking, body battery, altitude acclimation.
October 7, 2022 | Seve Beautiful watch that provides the expected tracking The watch is beautiful, a little thick and heavy. It meets my expectations and offers many health tracking features.

Missing a written manual for French.
October 7, 2022 | RIJO ScanWatch User Review I like its design, useful for knowing my heart rate while cycling as well as the distance while walking.

Battery durability (approximately 1 month after 2 years of use) also highly appreciated.
October 7, 2022 | Louve Could do better In sport mode, automatic pause would be a plus. Lacks a bit of precision in heart rate measurement. (Compared to a chest strap) October 7, 2022 | Titi3618 Watch that primarily tells the time I like its appearance, which is that of a normal watch. It instantly displays the number of steps taken on its dial. As for the rest, it offers a significant number of easy options.

October 7, 2022 | Kevin L No return on demand Always the same problem with activity detection. Add an option to disable this feature.

October 7, 2022 | TOF 1 1 October 7, 2022 | ERW Does what is says on the tin :-) Monitors all as expected. Some automatically, others manually. Good for monitoring health health, oxy stats, sleep.
October 7, 2022 | Rab Nice tool Better measures October 7, 2022 | Thanos Revolutionary I use my watch every day, as a watch and then much more. The health monitoring is second to none and all is recorded on the app which even gives you a full weekly report. It is amazing.
October 7, 2022 | Billt Elegance and long lasting battery More measurements, same battery life October 7, 2022 | Attilio Smart watch in elegant body Excellent health functions with limited sport tracking. With blood pressure monitor and smart scale (separate products, also Withings) fits all my needs.
October 7, 2022 | Miklós Everything you need from a watch As a person who’s aging, it is of imperative importance to keep track of any signals that something could be wrong with my heart October 7, 2022 | IvanT Walking Yes I use it,combined it my withing scales to monitor my health after my oesophagus cancer removal.
October 7, 2022 | Jack it has no HRV analysis It helped me to control my exercise and my physical condition October 7, 2022 | Dimitri Good but with room for improvement The watch is nice in general but there is a bit of room for improvement on the size of the display and the construction of the menu for easier navigation.
October 7, 2022 | Marcin Great watch I like the look, the battery life, the functions. It could be improved by having more bands available in Australia and have a glass back where the sensor is as I get a rash on my wrist.
October 7, 2022 | anthbear Best watch on the market Foremost is the quality an the styling then battery life of once a month an for comfort on my wrist I is a very special watch to me October 7, 2022 | Dave c It's stylish, yet functional in all sports The stylish 'mechanical' and smart watch functionalities makes it versatile all-around wear w. 24/7 tracking I wish it had remote functions for Android: call answering, camera remote, next song October 7, 2022 | Thomas G Great hybrid watch I have liked Withings watches from the begging, starting with their first Swiss Made hybrid connected watch. The ScanWatch is great in terms of design, features and baterry.
October 7, 2022 | Razvan Super watch! I’m about 10 years with Withings product October 7, 2022 | Alexey Use for several medical reasons I can keep my medical records with me at all times. Even test when out if something feels wrong.
October 7, 2022 | Dave S.
Good looking! I like the stylish look, and the rechargeable battery that lasts way longer than other smart watches’ batteries do.
October 7, 2022 | Mats Beautiful, functional watch I’m often asked about it this watch as it’s actually nice to look at, people are amazed of all the features. The long battery life clinches it over others October 7, 2022 | Alice Just a simple watch Nothing special about it October 7, 2022 | John The best smart watch choice For those who don't want a flashy toy-looking watch on their wrist but prefer to have a classic looking watch that includes the most necessary health functions.
October 7, 2022 | Marius Exactly what I needed As a person with heart problems I purchased the ScanWatch because of its health tracking abilities. It has been invaluable & provided day to day peace of mind.
October 7, 2022 | Peter Good watch, very bad app.
The app should be improved greatly. The walking distance inaccurate. I really would appreciate a feature: when the watch disconnect from my phone (because of distance) it could give a notification.
October 7, 2022 | Imre Beautiful watch Functionalities are great. the battery could last longer though. and it could have more analysis options for the heart conditions. also, it would be nice if gps worked without the phone (I don't want) October 7, 2022 | vaiva Smartwatch looking like regular watch SpO2 and heart rate uninterrupted record October 7, 2022 | David Excellent hardware Superior build quality and materials, excellent battery life. My only suggestion would be to use luminescent hand and markings on the Activity dial.
October 7, 2022 | Demonike A tight fit Unless the watch is worn on a tight strap there is a propensity for the crown to be accidentally depressed resulting in annoying Ian’s unwanted functions kicking in.
October 7, 2022 | Ian My Messages and Health Fact Reporter! The best function is my messages and call display so I do not always have to dig into my pocket to check my mobile. Health, sleep & steps and especially weight with my synched Withing's scale! October 7, 2022 | Budd Great battery, solid activity tracking It's a great watch with impeccable design, great battery life, and ability to track lots of activities. A dedicated GPS and more advanced metrics for activity tracking would be a great addition.
October 7, 2022 | Ivo Very good product 1 month without charge is nice.
October 7, 2022 | Damien Battery seems to degrade I‘m still missing the nap-detection which was working perfectly until this feature was removed with no understandable reason. It looks like the battery is degrading over time.
October 7, 2022 | TGO Love it Great battery life. Subtle styling.
October 7, 2022 | Paul Amazing watch Keep me going until I achieve my step goal October 7, 2022 | GaryZ Useful Using smartwatch I can receive useful detailed information about my sleep, workouts, sometimes I can check ECG, oxygen saturation. I am satisfied with using it.
October 7, 2022 | Attila Solid smartwatch The battery lifetime is unbeatable. Design wise it rather looks like a proper watch than a smartwatch.
October 7, 2022 | Marcus Its beautiful, reliable and always charged up Love my ScanWatch Horizon, but had to upgrade to it due moisture seal fail on previous ScanWatch after 2 years. Wish Withings watch + app would give more info during runs e.g. buzz every km.
October 7, 2022 | Mark R Oxygen levels and heart rate monitoring Long battery life October 7, 2022 | Halsey Good on the whole Does what is says and is reliable. The main thing I dont like is lack of weekly exercise target and actual minutes on dashboard; all other main manftrs. have this (Garmin/Apple etc) October 7, 2022 | User Great looking Smartwatch.
I was apprehensive at first as I wasn't familiar with the name, but I'm so glad I bought one. The features on the app are great. Just a shame it doesn't have its own GPS. Would recommend.
October 7, 2022 | David It's analogue - and smart! I love that the bands are standard size. Crazy idea: buy moov.cc and integrate their swimming tracking.
October 7, 2022 | Tim W Your health status in your hands I like the fact I can do a quick check on oxygen, ECG and BPM with a few touches when I need it. But I love that I can track sleep, breathing disturbances, and activities automatically.
October 7, 2022 | Monica Almost there The watch itself physically is a well polished piece of kit. I've been wearing it for about a year now and there are small software things which get in the way of making this a 5 star product.
October 7, 2022 | Gurps Excellent timing & other things It's simple 2 set up & operate. Teh glass on the face can scratch easily. No I don't use it with any other Withings products October 7, 2022 | Ewey My Withings is the only watch I wear now! I love the look, feel and wear of this watch. And it keeps track of me medically while looking great on my wrist! October 7, 2022 | Carrie P The best classic smart watches.
I love the timeless design and how the 'smart' part of the watches is subtle. The practical side of the device is excellent durability and battery.
October 7, 2022 | David S.
More Smartwatch than it looks The small display is bright and easy to read. The control concept is logical and intuitive. The battery life is great.
October 7, 2022 | Tom It’s accuracy is reliable. It looks good.
I own three Withings products, I also got one each for my daughter and my husband, we all wear our watches all the time because you can, in the shower, sports, and for keeping a check on your health.
October 7, 2022 | Stebby Elegant, smart and accurate watch Lovely watch, with great tech and app. Very accurate ECG, and excellent battery life.
October 7, 2022 | Nb75 Comfort and reliability It is elegant, precise and very useful when using it with the information provided by the scale October 7, 2022 | Shilou Weight and composition If used with other products, it can greatly improve assistance in breakdowns and repairs that do not exist and you must buy a new one October 7, 2022 | Ramesphal Perfekt I use the ScanWatch, the scale, the thermometer and the blood pressure monitor October 7, 2022 | Alexander M.
Battery Life I think the design of the watch as well as the battery life and charging time are unbeatable.
October 7, 2022 | Alexander M.
Full control connectivity is great. Infotainment from the phone could be better October 7, 2022 | Carlo Everything works perfectly All functions are trouble-free, I still use the scale, both are displayed well on my phone.
October 7, 2022 | F.S.
Very nice watch with great features I like how discreet it is. The main functions are available. However, the calorie count seems to be very inaccurate. I use the scale for that.
October 7, 2022 | Marsha Gesundheit Form-fitting, Robust, Very good functionality October 7, 2022 | Nils A beautiful smart watch The watch has the classic beauty of a wristwatch and all the latest health functions.
October 7, 2022 | tad Sleep Positive sleep control Negative too few fashion October 7, 2022 | Barbara She does what she's supposed to do Really good piece October 7, 2022 | Ernst-Friedrich H.
Classic yet modern I like the design of the watch and how long the battery lasts. I would like to have a few more sports like stand-up paddleboarding. I still use the scale.
October 7, 2022 | Yvi Gesundheit Maybe it could also measure blood pressure October 7, 2022 | Erwin Digital in analog design Battery life TOP (20 days without problems); Charger FLOP (charging contact is sensitive) October 7, 2022 | Oliver Great battery life Stylish design, great battery, various workouts are automatically detected October 7, 2022 | Nicole Great overall package with long battery life The watch is functional with a timeless design. Particularly noteworthy is the long battery life and data storage in Europe.

Unfortunately, not all iPhone notifications (e.g. WhatsApp) are consistently displayed. I also own Thermo, Blood Pressure, and Scale October 7, 2022 | Vater Top Quality Easy Operation October 7, 2022 | KWH User-friendly Good overview of health and easy to use without any additional effort. It is shocking to see after a week that you have only taken 2000 steps daily.
October 7, 2022 | Werner Very helpful Helpful for me in the health field but also motivating for training October 7, 2022 | Otto B.
Solid, classic hybrid watch.
Improve precision of the hands when setting. Second hand.
October 7, 2022 | Marc Reliable, accurate, long battery life, beautiful The ScanWatch has proven that Withings products work reliably. The design is pleasantly understated. The purchase of additional Withings products in the future is not ruled out.
October 7, 2022 | Hans-Jürgen Still clock The appearance is the first priority because it is not immediately recognizable as a smart watch, battery available for up to 25 days and many activity options October 7, 2022 | Roedermerker Balance between optics and utility Having heart rate and EKG in such a beautiful watch is great! However, the heart rate measurement while walking is unfortunately poor and not usable (often much higher when compared to a reliable secondary device).
October 7, 2022 | Kai Querbeet I like the simple clear appearance. I would like a display for body temperature.
October 7, 2022 | Horst Watch with many functions Interesting functions that can be read through the app.
October 7, 2022 | Dr. P. R.
Gut Wristbands could be better higher time accuracy October 7, 2022 | Kurt Opinion Analysis, e.g. pulse, in the app should be more accurate October 7, 2022 | TR Very good watch! It would be useful to have blood pressure measurement. Unfortunately, the watch keeps showing that I have been cycling, but it's not true. The sensitivity of the detection should be revised here.
October 7, 2022 | GWE Super beautiful and yet functional watch The design is great, you can't tell it's a fitness watch. Some winter sports could still be added (cross-country skiing, curling).
October 7, 2022 | Nina Stylish - no colorful 'mouse cinema' Does everything it promises. I miss the option to recognize longer standing and to start a workout without a phone and record it.
October 7, 2022 | Leiselauscher Sport promoting Blood pressure measurement would be nice October 7, 2022 | Klauzi Good control Good feedback on daily movement October 7, 2022 | Daniel S.

October 7, 2022 | Günter H.
She helps one to move more One can see their step count immediately, heart rate and blood oxygen are accessible. Even outside of sports, these are helpful information October 7, 2022 | PeTu Simple and clear operation.
VF detection is very good. Unfortunately, blood pressure measurement is missing.
October 7, 2022 | Gerhard B.
Long battery life Great, regular watch design yet smart, with long battery life and 100% waterproof, suitable for swimming October 7, 2022 | D.H.
The heart rate monitor measures incorrectly Except for the heart rate function, I find the watch very good. I also have the scale.
October 7, 2022 | cfw The scale keeps running and running and running...
The best argument is the long battery life and the fully automatic detection of sports - really top October 7, 2022 | Dirk Excellent companion Can always rely on watch and data. Very good battery life. Occasionally compare measurements with the doctor to evaluate the results.
October 7, 2022 | Michael B.
Reliable and elegant Looks good, the records work reliably and no one notices that it is a smartwatch.
October 7, 2022 | TS ScanWatch Overall, I am very satisfied. The only thing that bothers me about the sleep analysis is that it considers lying still as sleep. Currently, I find the sleep analysis of the Apple Watch to be more accurate.
October 7, 2022 | T.R.
Practical and beautiful Blood pressure measurement October 7, 2022 | Toni2504 perfect technology and impeccable support timeless design, clear app, long battery life October 7, 2022 | Gerd G.
Very long battery life 30 days of battery life, very nice design. Great watch for sports. The watch could be improved in terms of sleep analysis. Additionally, I have a scale, blood pressure monitor, and thermometer.
October 7, 2022 | Bernd B.
Modern technology in a classic watch design Long battery life, inconspicuousness, reliability, and reproducible measurement results. Common use with the blood pressure monitor. I wish for a more universal data export for my own October 7, 2022 | Bernd Daily Motivator You can't tell from the outside what my ScanWatch with stainless steel strap is capable of ;-) I use it for activity and sleep tracking and try to follow the personalized recommendations.
October 7, 2022 | Gerhard Multifunctional health and fitness tracker The long battery life is great. It would be desirable if blood pressure could also be measured and sugar levels could be entered. I also use the upper arm blood pressure monitor October 7, 2022 | Doc. Michael Top product at a fair price In addition to the ScanWatch, I also use the smart scale Body Cardio, both complement each other very well and the combination of the two devices with the HealthApp on my smartphone is great October 7, 2022 | Peter Robust watch with great features Button lock would be good. Recognize movement while swimming. Detect active calories. Measure temperature October 7, 2022 | Sven M.
Long battery life, inaccurate pedometer Long battery life. Pedometer and Bluetooth connection could be improved.
October 7, 2022 | A.Selent Beautiful Watch The sleek design of the ScanWatch (38mm) immediately caught my attention when I was searching. I use the watch in conjunction with a Body Cardio and a BPM Connect.
October 7, 2022 | R. B.
the data from the watch i blood pressure monitor scale and thermometer all from Withings October 7, 2022 | Bettina Long battery life Good connection stability to mobile phone, very good battery life, health report of the app should be configurable October 7, 2022 | Alex Good, but room for improvement When everything works, the ScanWatch is good. Occasionally, sleep is not recorded or recorded incompletely. If Bluetooth could be turned off, the watch would be perfect.
October 7, 2022 | Horschte The watch has a very long battery life and is Visually appealing. Improvement: shorter strap length for slim wrists, so that the watch fits well and measures accurately.
October 7, 2022 | TLA Alles super, except not waterproof Waterproof October 7, 2022 | Moni Reliable and robust I like the quality of the case and the sapphire glass. I use the sports functions and occasionally the notifications. The watch could be a bit more compact and lighter.
October 7, 2022 | Jens F Long battery life Navigation is missing October 7, 2022 | Lomugolf Atrial fibrillation is not always displayed The watch looks great, is not immediately recognizable as a functional watch. The EKG should be improved. Often does not detect atrial fibrillation. Especially during tachycardia.
October 7, 2022 | Monika C.
It should be a help, not replace a doctor Scale Blood pressure Watch determine why one does not feel fit in the morning. Nordic walking is missing in the activity October 7, 2022 | Hothe good health monitoring Very good health monitoring, not suitable for sports activities. The automatic detection is insufficient and inaccurate. Suggestion: automatic detection should be turned off.
October 7, 2022 | Bernd Highly recommended Very good stability, it would be desirable to display EKG instead of just 'normal' October 7, 2022 | Mister55 Reliable, competent companion I use the ScanWatch to monitor heart and oxygen saturation October 7, 2022 | Jules S.

October 7, 2022 | Heinz Very satisfied I only use the watch. It focuses on the essentials and has no unnecessary frills. I consider it a medical device for displaying suspicion of atrial fibrillation.
October 7, 2022 | Mick Unreliable display Display often incorrect When atrial fibrillation is indicated, the message 'Normal sinus curve' appears upon verification October 7, 2022 | Dieter Good battery, data quality generally okay I really like the design - analog dial. The step counter motivates me, I use the heart function scanner regularly. Tracking sleep phases used to work better.

October 6, 2022 | Andrew Well-made, useless for sleep tracking The ScanWatch looks really nice, like a high-quality traditional watch. The build quality is high. It works well as a step tracker. The sleep tracking is terrible. It's a good watch, not a great watch October 6, 2022 | Matt Tracking sleep Like appearance and display in app. Download of updates often doesn't work.
October 6, 2022 | Kevin A great watch - but...
Long battery life, a great list of features October 6, 2022 | Mikey The app forgot I have a watch synced After latest update the app broke the connection to my watch. No more activity syncing.
October 6, 2022 | Demetri Exactly what I was looking for The Scanwatch replaced my Galaxy Watch after 3 years. Why did I switch or not stay with Samsung? - The watch looks like a watch, an inconspicuous display with fluorescent hands, so you don't necessarily have to activate the display in the dark. - The battery life of the latest Samsung models is 3-4 days and the Scanwatch lasted 25 days with my settings. - All functions can be used with any smartphone manufacturer. With the competition, you need a smartphone from the same manufacturer to use all features. - The watch is not as big as the competition and thanks to sapphire glass, it has a significantly higher protection against scratches on the glass. Of course, the accuracy of the health functions of a smartwatch can be debated. Compared to my Samsung, I didn't notice any difference in pulse or steps, so it's neither worse nor better. Sometimes I feel that if you move a little slower, the watch doesn't record the steps as well. Probably the acceleration sensor is not as sensitive as with other manufacturers. I think the app is very well done. It's not overloaded and synchronization takes just a few seconds. For each feature, there are either video tutorials or fancy pictures that explain everything. Only the sleep recording is not really good. Sleep interruptions of several hours have been indicated several times, even though I slept through the night. Also, lying down and listening to audiobooks is not sleeping, Samsung is better at that. Workout detection also works, but since the watch doesn't have GPS, you have to manually start the workout to record the running or cycling route. A recording without a smartphone would therefore not be possible. All in all, I'm still very satisfied with the watch. Most of them can do more, but for me, a step counter, pulse, notifications, and recording sports 3 times a week are completely sufficient. Of course, you can answer messages by voice and check the weather report with Samsung, Apple, Huawei, and Co., and you don't necessarily need a smartphone for sports, but most watches are also much more expensive and require the appropriate smartphone manufacturer for some functions and need to be charged more frequently.

October 6, 2022 | Denis cougnaud useless thing it's not even pretty October 6, 2022 | R. ONCHON ecg no improvement since the release over two years ago very disappointing October 6, 2022 | david l The importance of transparency The lack of transparency of the company Withings in selling us wonderful products without telling us the whole truth. As the product does not have this function in certain countries.
October 6, 2022 | Stephen Very nice watch The exterior of the watch is surprisingly beautiful. I installed the app on both my smartphone and tablet, as the tablet provides a better overview. If I want to view the latest measurement results on one of the devices, I have to turn off the other device, otherwise I cannot see the current results. Another drawback is the display of the sleep index. It is not clear how long I spent in deep sleep or in a wakeful state. The REM phases are not displayed at all. The times when the individual phases lasted are also not visible. I have had another device before that was only half as expensive, but it displayed the sleep phases more accurately. However, there was no possibility to create an ECG and measure the oxygen concentration in the blood. All in all, I don't want to miss the device though.
October 3, 2022 | anonymous Refund not working I bought 2 of the watches because I wanted to give them to my parents. Since my mother does not want the watch, I returned the ladies' model over a month ago. Unfortunately, no refund has been made to date. Otherwise, the watch is very nice - my father likes his watch.
October 2, 2022 | anonymous I like it The battery life is good, so it's nice that it's okay to charge it once every 3 weeks to 1 month for normal use. I also like the scoring of sleep. I replaced the belt, so I don't feel uncomfortable even when I'm working. I'm glad I didn't give up on finding a watch-like design.
October 2, 2022 | anonymous Withings ScanWatch Hybrid Smartwatch I'm not a watch person, but this watch is amazing, I don't take it off anymore. Easy to use, no unnecessary frills, time and date easily readable, does everything that's important to me, battery life is incredibly great! Clear app, October 1, 2022 | anonymous Very happy with my purchase I love the way the watch looks, not square, bulky and masculine. I love all the things it keeps track of, the app and that it easily syncs with my doctors app.
October 1, 2022 | anonymous Solid watch The watch is beautiful. It looks like a really nice fancy watch. Full disclosure, I returned the watch. I was really looking to wearing it to bed. I’m a light sleeper and found the watch to heavy to wear. My focus is on sleep. I loved the details from the app and that it sends data to Apple Health. This is the only reason I reduced it by one star and why i returned it. For comparison, it’s heavier than Apple Watch 7 andFitbit Versa 2. Not by tons but still noticeable for me. Good luck! September 28, 2022 | anonymous Timeless design Well suited for monitoring and controlling bodily functions September 27, 2022 | anonymous A beautiful, simple and timeless watch that measures important vital and activity values The watch finally meets my expectations of a beautiful and informative watch. All data is smoothly transferred to the mobile phone. The measured sleep data is very informative and motivates me to go to bed earlier and improve my overall sleep behavior. As a heart patient, the possibility of ECG and accurate pulse measurement calms me down. In any case, I am thrilled with this very beautiful and simple watch with timeless elegance, but also with the recording of vital values and my activities. I like to wear the watch very much because it is hardly noticeable, even at night. So for me, a watch that I would really recommend at any time.
September 26, 2022 | anonymous Super Fits perfectly September 25, 2022 | anonymous Great successor to Withings Sport HR I am a convinced user of smart watches that do not want to show this immediately. Ideal successor for my Withings Sport HR. The additional functions are excellent and the size is still suitable for my narrow arm. The price was unbeatable compared to the manufacturer's website. Delivery was as usual fast and punctual.
September 25, 2022 | anonymous Long battery life Still working on the accuracy.I seem to have several thousand more steps using my Fitbit. The biggest issue so far is the magnet on the charger is very weak.Does not stay attached to the watch if it’s not flat.
September 25, 2022 | anonymous Very interesting watch that doesn't look like a tracker at all. Stylish Great features, classic look, very versatile September 22, 2022 | anonymous Good quality for a reasonable price I needed a reliable source for recording the vital functions of my heart. The Scan-Watch does exactly what it is supposed to do and with the PDF function, it gives me the ability to send the corresponding EKG diagrams to my doctor if needed. I highly recommend it.
September 21, 2022 | anonymous Quality TOP, solid software! It is immediately noticeable that the watch feels absolutely valuable and has a great design. However, if you want a smartwatch with many display options and graphics DIRECTLY on the watch, this is not the right one. Most of the data processing, display, graphics, and information is done directly on the Bluetooth-connected phone. But the software runs very smoothly and solidly and seems absolutely mature. What I don't like so much is that the menu navigation is too confusing for me personally. What I notice about Bluetooth is that the connection between the watch and the phone only breaks off when my phone connects to other Bluetooth devices (e.g. with headphones or with my older smartwatch). Then it may be necessary to reconnect. Otherwise, the connection is very stable and reliable. So I am absolutely thrilled with my watch!! September 21, 2022 | anonymous The watch is good for self-monitoring.
I bought the watch for my husband's birthday.
September 20, 2022 | anonymous Love this watch! Two weeks in and I am very pleased.I bought this watch to do three specific things (besides keeping time):1) Monitor for a-fib and provide a cardiac rhythm strip (not really an “EKG”) for my cardiologist.2) Monitor my sleep and O2 sats within reasonable accuracy parameters. 3) Allow me to screen emails without pulling the phone out.This Watch checks all the boxes and I am fine with analog face, have never really used a digital watch.Have only charged once so battery is a bonus- I sent back an Apple Watch because the short battery life.Included strap is very comfortable and the weight is fine, actually lighter than my prior diving watch.The watch looks great but that is low on my list.I do not wear it in the shower and probably will always keep it out of water, after all my diving watch is for that.Very pleased so far…hoping the reliability won’t let me down! September 17, 2022 | anonymous Connection problems after about 1 year!!? For the 2nd time already, the app has failed, in other words, no recordings are made. I have already bought this watch with ECG function twice. I am disappointed about it. The factory reset does not work. I don't know what to do. I use the watch without the app - so I have no visual recordings - what a pity!! September 14, 2022 | anonymous Withings Watch The setup was quick, I've had it for 1 week and the battery is still at 70%. Despite being 82 years old, I can manage it well. I can only recommend it.
September 13, 2022 | anonymous Uhr Super watch, very satisfied, THANK YOU September 12, 2022 | anonymous Great watch It does what it's supposed to do September 12, 2022 | anonymous Great find. Amazing Scan Watch A really good Scan Watch with a focus on health aspects, also designed to look great. Definitely an eye-catcher! Setting up the Scan Watch is easy. Congratulations to the developers! September 12, 2022 | anonymous Great Smart-Watch So far so good, great performing watch. However, I'm still waiting on how my $50 credit for the 'labor Day' discount. No one is answering any of my inquiries.
September 12, 2022 | anonymous Super Concept Withings offers a whole health concept with watches, scales, blood pressure monitors and more. I dared to try the watch. It arrived on time and quickly. Configuring it is intuitive and very flexible. So everyone can set up which information and messages they would like. Sleep control was important to me. With the included silicone bracelet, the watch is really comfortable to wear - even at night. And with the results that can be accessed every morning, if you want, lights have gone on for me. I now know exactly why I'm sometimes still so tired in the morning. With a battery life of one month, Withings hasn't promised too much. If you write a lot of EKGs or measure O2 saturation, the runtime is of course correspondingly shorter, but still very reasonable. The watch is also medically validated. Finally, there is also the possibility to write the collected data into a PDF file to prepare for a doctor's visit. Of course, this does not replace the examinations of the family doctor, but based on the data, he can see very well where he should look. I have been using this watch continuously for a month and am very satisfied.
September 9, 2022 | anonymous Smartwatch Well suited for medical purposes, extensive software included. High-quality hardware execution.
September 8, 2022 | anonymous Very stylish SmartWatch This watch looks elegant and high-quality. It is not recognizable as a SmartWatch at all. The battery life is great, only needs to be charged every few weeks. The connection to the phone (here Google Pixel 6 Pro) is very stable. The functions are all well implemented and useful, only the automatic sleep detection should be improved, the falling asleep time is not reliably detected. The case and glass are robust and the watch does not wear too thick. The alarm function is clever, it can shift the alarm signal to a phase of light sleep. The highlight is the companion app Health Mate, which is very clear and comes with useful tips and hints. It's a bit of a shame that there is a cloud requirement, but a check has at least shown that only connections to the Withings cloud and the usual Google APIs are established.
September 8, 2022 | anonymous First impression almost 5 stars The watch seems very high quality and is quite easy to use. The setup is a bit cumbersome to understand, in case, like in my case, something goes wrong. Unfortunately, a part of the bracelet arrived defective for me - namely, on one side the 'knob' is missing to remove and replace the bracelet (see picture). However, the supplied bracelet is very high quality and soft, making it comfortable to wear. ECG, blood pressure measurement, messages on the watch, sleep monitoring, etc. all work very well 👍That's why 4 stars (almost 5).
September 8, 2022 | anonymous The perfect smartwatch for me I wanted a simple watch with a pedometer and health functions that also lasts 2 weeks without a charger. That's exactly what this watch offers. The accompanying app also works as it should.
September 7, 2022 | anonymous Replaced my Apple Watch When my Apple Watch broke, I debated about replacing it or buying the Withings Scan Watch.Decided on the latter for a number of reasons, but the biggest one was battery life.I was so tired of charging my Apply Watch every single day.The battery life on the Withings is mind blowing good.I don't miss any of the features the Apple Watch had, and the Withings Oz and ECG are nice extras for me.I really like the bottom dial for steps as that is something i monitor every day.I already loved the app since I have the scale, temp, and blood pressure cuff already, so nice to just add the watch and everything syncs up nicely and data is in one place.The watch is the perfect size, I hated to have a dinner plate on my wrist and this is the perfect size.The weight is great for me as well and I like the way it looks.I was going to buy the metal band, but glad that I didn't when I found out the EcG performs best with the black band that is standard.Very happy with this purchase.
September 7, 2022 | anonymous Super! The Scanwatch is great, even my doctor is impressed with the results the watch provides.
September 6, 2022 | anonymous Incredibly valuable, largely medically oriented watch! After receiving a 42mm variant from the warehouse last week as unusable goods (first time disappointment with the warehouse, which I hold in high regard..): NOW a new attempt with a new 38mm variant: and wow: an incredibly well thought-out watch with many health-related parameters! Possibly a medical product, as even the ECG readings are displayed extremely precisely. This would put aside my criticism of the 'slip-up' from the warehouse last week. I can recommend this watch (even as a doctor) to anyone who may suffer from AFib. A technical masterpiece at an affordable price, quality, and knowledge from France! After a direct comparison with the two sizes, I would also recommend the smaller version to men, discreet and understated. Nobody knows that it is a sophisticated technology, and not just a smartwatch gimmick....By the way, it is also not a smartwatch, it can provide subtle vibration reminders for incoming emails, etc., but can be turned off. Withings calls it a hybrid watch. The best purchase on Amazon for months!! Essential for patients with arrhythmias/suspected sleep apnea! It's strange that I didn't come across this article earlier. So, I use a device from another company with only 2 leads, which can be used as a handheld device on myself and patients. However, the quality of the ECG curves is unbeatable with Withings. ABSOLUTE purchase recommendation for a specific customer group!!!!! Update: No patient with paroxysmal AFib should do without this watch! Easy to use. The most useful ECG watch on the market. I recommend the 38mm version. A YouTube video confirms this. The most useful smartwatch on the market!!!!! September 4, 2022 | anonymous Great Watch I like this watch a lot, it's stylish and load with features. I use it every day.
September 2, 2022 | anonymous If you think you're not receiving notifications...
My predecessor was able to use it without any problems, so even after passing away, I chose the same model without hesitation. However, it seems that the firmware has been updated, and there are many changes from before, so it took some time to get used to it. The biggest change was that [SETTING]-[DO NOT DISTURB] increased, and ON/OFF notifications are changed together. If you think you're not receiving notifications, try switching it.
September 2, 2022 | anonymous Battery life is incredible.
This product works well. There is much to be desired in terms of sleep tracking, but everything else is great. Battery life is almost 2 weeks.
August 28, 2022 | anonymous Pragmatically well solved The watch will bring you joy if you are interested in a pragmatic smartwatch with data acquisition via app. As a hybrid watch, the watch also has a colorless display. However, reading messages here is kept simple compared to a full smartwatch. For me as an athlete, the features are completely sufficient and, due to the classic design, a preferred variant to smartwatches with a full display. The materials are high quality and the watch generally looks very high quality. The dial does not stand out so much because there are no elements but color is used. The blood oxygen measurement never delivered a result at the beginning, but this may also be due to the situation. // August 27, 2022 | anonymous Top smartwatch with many health features and classic design I am positively impressed with this smartwatch. This is my first watch with health features and I am excited about the many functions it offers. What I can say after a few days of use is that these functions provide realistic values. It is also great that other apps can be easily integrated, such as WhatsApp or Outlook. But the best thing is the design of a classic analog watch. No one can tell at first glance that it is a smartwatch. The only small drawbacks are that the watch must be worn tightly on the wrist, which can be uncomfortable over time. In addition, the included silicone strap is extremely long and unfortunately replacement bands are not available in different lengths.
August 26, 2022 | anonymous Combination of analog watch and smartwatch with ECG analysis. Battery lasts 10 days.
Looks like an analog watch and is one. The smart functions work well with the app. Recorded ECGs can be forwarded as PDF. I myself am a cardiologist - with these ECGs, a rhythm analysis can be done well. If you are unsure about the automatic evaluation - regarding atrial fibrillation detection, it usually works correctly - you can send the PDF to your doctor. The workout function also works well. However, unlike competitor models, the watch relies on the connection to the mobile phone. And you can't make calls with it - I don't think you need to.
August 26, 2022 | anonymous very happy so far i spent a long time searching through the best hybrid watches and im glad i went for this one, i wanted something that looked good (not like the clunky techy touchscreen smartwatches) and would do simple things like step count, sleep track and maybe some exercise stuff.it defo looks lovely with the silver link band on and ive already gotten compliments on it :) price is reasonable and quality feels really good.looking forward to getting much more use out of it :D August 25, 2022 | anonymous Just enough smart features I have been wearing this watch for a few weeks now and overall I am happy with it. I was replacing a fossil gen 5, which I liked too but I got tired of having to charge it everyday and if I used all the features it would not even make it until bedtime. Since the batteries in smartwatches don't seem to last long enough, I decided to switch to a hybrid watch. If the battery lasts at least a week or two that seems reasonable and this one does.The scan watch gave me what I used most on the gen 5, so I thought I would give it a try. I got the 42mm one because the hands glow in the dark, but I found they are harder to read then just pressing the dial to bring up the digital clock in the small screen, although sometimes it can be too small to read without my glasses.The build quality is good and I think it is attractive. This is the first time I have used a silicone band, but I like it. The band is very long, and I have an average size wrist, so I would say get a different band if you have small wrists.The digital screen is functional but I guess it could be hard for some people to read. Notification alerts are all I was looking for, so the string of text that comes across the screen is enough to let you know what it is or who the notification is from and if I want to look at it.All of the health features are nice and the app is laid out well to read them all. I mostly just track my steps, but I like the other tracking features. The connection to my phone has been fine, except after an update to Android 13, but that seemed to get fixed with an update. The analog tracking dial is also a cool feature.What more can I say, nice watch. Not perfect, but it is a keeper.
August 25, 2022 | anonymous Wasn’t a fan.
I liked how pretty it was. I liked how it looked like a real watch. However it wasn’t accurate on the pulse ox, I didn’t like how it showed notifications like a banner and they were super short. I guess going from a FitBit to this one, I was a little spoiled but eventually what drove me to send it back was that it kept getting loose no matter what setting I put the wrist on. That was driving me crazy! I ended up getting a Garmin Hybrid and I am very happy I did.
August 25, 2022 | anonymous Long battery life for measuring sleep quality Oxygen concentration has large variations August 21, 2022 | anonymous The fitness device I have been waiting for Absolutely worth the price!+Excellent design and build.+Suitable even for someone with a thin wrist.+Black screen is large for easy reading but well hidden and matches the blue watch face.+Battery is awesome, really hits 30 days.-App is okay to use (a bit buggy and had some trouble navigating around looking for things) for tracking your steps and other health parameters. Sometimes it mistakes my brisk walks to cycling.-Skin feels a bit itchy after sweating with the silicon strap, so changed to the Milanese rose gold strap; colour matches perfectly, and gives the watch a premium look.
August 21, 2022 | anonymous Better than I hoped The perfect fitness watch for me: tracks all exercise routines as well as sleep time and quality, heartbeat, etc.And it looks terrific, like a classic quality watch instead of a gray plastic rectangular taped to your wrist (I'm looking at you, Fitbit) - AND it holds a charge for two to three weeks.Highly recommended.
August 18, 2022 | anonymous Very good functionality I best Looking Cardio watch !! Form and functionality is great! August 17, 2022 | anonymous A great product I've only had the watch for a day and I'm completely impressed. The setup and connection with the app is easy, the features are great and work flawlessly. The device looks good and is easy to use. The battery life also seems to match the description. I can only recommend the watch.
August 17, 2022 | anonymous GREAT PURCHASE I pondered for quite some time (probably 2 months) if I should spend money on this Smart Watch.I read the reviews and decided to give it a try.I have to say I am extremely pleased with this watch. It was very easy to set up.The app is user friendly,It looks very nice.I can not get 28 days of battery life, but I use this watch every day to track my workouts and I can easily get 2 weeks on the battery.I do like the ECG function.My only suggestion would be for the manufacturer implement a built in blood pressure monitor as a feature (versus a peripheral blood pressure option).
August 16, 2022 | anonymous No sleep data on WATCH :( So I like this watch a lot, but I wanted to see sleep data on the watch, at least the latest night data.Instead it requires bluetooth connection and mobile phone app.I dont like turning on bluetooth especially as I sleep or wake up. which is when I want to see the data. I especially dont want to get up and grab and see a bright phone screen which is required since it uses the app.Hope withings can push an update to show at least the latest night sleep data(length, deep sleep and light sleep numbers, avg heart rate)I would be happy to change this to five stars if so.Pros:long battery lifeCons:no sleep data on watchMaybe they can release a more premium version with GPS that can be turned on onboard too, But its fine if not, as I may get the Garmin Instinct 2 Solar instead. I just dont like to use multiple watches though :/ August 16, 2022 | anonymous Minimalist design and high-quality watch It does not have as many features as other high-end smartwatches or the Apple Watch, but it has the minimum notification function and excellent tracking function, which is satisfying. And above all, the design is fantastic! Personally, it is the number one design among hybrid smartwatches.
August 11, 2022 | anonymous Very nice & works great! After a long search and browsing through hundreds of reviews of various smartwatches, I ended up with this hybrid form and did not regret it! The watch is visually very nice, the functions are as expected, the battery level varies depending on usage. The associated app is easy to understand and use, the connection is stable and uncomplicated - in short: So far, I am more than satisfied with this watch!!! August 9, 2022 | anonymous Not new I received what appeared to be used.I thought I bought a new one so I returned it August 9, 2022 | anonymous I really needed to be able to check health parameters by I love that I can easily view ALL THAT I NEED. The ecg has picked up on AFib twice, prompting me to make an appointment! But I don't like the bright light every time I move at night! August 8, 2022 | anonymous 2 years of use, support is not great After 1 year and 10 months, suddenly I couldn't charge it anymore. I contacted customer support, but after several back and forth emails, they couldn't assist me because the warranty period had expired. It seems there is no repair option. They did offer a 25% discount at the official store, but it was not applicable for shipping to Japan, so it was meaningless for me. It's really disappointing because I liked it until the moment it stopped charging.
August 8, 2022 | anonymous Fitness Watch: Withings Scan Watch I am completely satisfied with this watch and bought it specifically to do something good for my health. I have problems with my heart, VHF, with breathing, and also with oxygen saturation. Therefore, I have more control over it.
August 7, 2022 | anonymous Better alternative to Apple Watch or similar Everything a smartwatch needs. Plus, the advantage of only having to charge once a month and the great design August 6, 2022 | anonymous Attractive, but couldnt get the O2 monitor to work So, its attractive, especially compared to my Samsung smartwatch I no longer use.I stopped using the Samsung because it was annoying to have to charge it every other nite.The Withings lasts much longer.But the difficulty of getting the O2 monitor to work meant it didnt meet my needs (+ the accuracy if working +/- 3% is too low to track my hypoxia).I sent it back.
August 6, 2022 | anonymous Stylish hybrid watch with great features! Super stylish watch with a beautiful dial, hidden features not immediately recognizable such as ECG and blood oxygen saturation, sports activities and more 👍‼️ Recommended August 5, 2022 | anonymous The best smartwatch! Perfect design - Simple and elegant.Long battery life - 1 month.Easy to use - Very simple setup.
August 4, 2022 | anonymous Just the right features and just the right design I was looking for a smartwatch like this. It can record steps, runs, and swims as an activity meter, and monitor heart rate and oxygen levels. It's just right, as it can't handle complex data or records. Compared to the competing Apple Watch, the design is excellent as it looks like a proper watch, and it only needs to be charged once a month, freeing me from the daily charging hassle.
August 3, 2022 | anonymous Great value, great fitness watch I wanted to keep track of fitness and heart rate/rhythm. It is approved by FDA. Looks like a dressier or normal watch but does it all health wise - pulse oximeter, ECG, heart rate, measure steps and sleep patterns. Text messages come across the screen. It does not play music and you cannot make a phone call with it. It works for what I needed and it was less expensive than most fitness watches. Battery life is crazy long too.
August 1, 2022 | anonymous smells not good if you continue use it for 2 days when I used it for two days, it smells not well.
August 1, 2022 | anonymous Looks like a watch......
and not like a wrist computer. Because the display only turns on relatively rarely, the battery lasts up to 2 weeks. It doesn't have as many features as the bitten apple, but it's completely sufficient for daily use.
July 29, 2022 | anonymous The simple smart smartwatch Pros: price is pretty goodBattery life is amazingBecause of battery life you can actually use sleep tracking and it does pretty wellGreat look (I was big into smart watches when they first were a thing. I even had the original gear the day it came out but within last 3 years grew tired of terrible battery life and I didn't really use them for smart features after a while especially cause they never look good)App is pretty nice and works wellFeels pretty good and not too heavyConsTakes a little while to set up. Give it about an hourBattery percentage indicator on app isn't perfect. Said 100% for like a week before it started going down. I keep most things on and have it vibrate for my messages and i get quite a bit everyday. Lasts about 3 weeks between charges no problem.If it could store music and be able to use with headphones I would have paid double. Seriously love this watch July 29, 2022 | anonymous Easy setup and plenty of features Instructions for setup were more clearly explained and demonstrated than for any other electronic device I’ve purchased. I like that the analog watch is visible at all times. In fact, it looks like a regular fashion watch, but is also a fitness tracker, has an ECG, pulse oximeter, and incoming notifications for iPhone calls & messages. Has all the features I need for half the price of the Apple Watch, many of the features of which I wouldn’t use.
July 29, 2022 | anonymous Display of EKG and atrial fibrillation The watch is already a masterpiece. The problem for me is that the wireless connection to the Withings app has already failed three times. Twice I reinstalled it and now for the third time, I can't go any further. The hands of the watch have freed the small dial (position, 10 to 12 the small hand and 10 past 12 the big hand. The watch shows 'Hello Setup'. The app wants to establish the connection but there is no connection. I can't set the watch forward or backward either. I am practically at my wit's end. My question is, can I exchange the watch with you or what do you advise me? Sincerely, Wolfgang Drews! July 28, 2022 | anonymous Great watch I already own the Withings Steel HR and have had it for a few years. That watch is still working but I decided to treat myself to the ScanWatch.The ScanWatch has all of the features of the HR but also includes electrocardiogram (ECG) and blood/oxygen monitoring.When you first pair the watch with the Withings app, you choose the State that you live in and then submit an ECG to a medical professional. They look over your sample and then give you the thumbs-up (hopefully). This process takes about 24 hours. After you get the green light, then the app will let you take an ECG (without submitting it) whenever you want.NB: The watch is currently locked to the region that you buy it. Therefore, if you buy it in the USA, then you choose your home State to register the ECG. At the time of writing there is no way to change the geographic location of the watch, which is a shame.So, if you intend to buy the watch at a good price due to currency fluctuations then just take into account the 'region lock'.As far as I'm aware, the watch/app will continue to let you take ECGs even if you travel to another region.
July 28, 2022 | anonymous Prima Ideal for quickly checking important health data.
July 27, 2022 | anonymous Stopped charging after 2 1/2 months, customer support slow This is a real shame, I love the watch but it just stopped charging after only 2 1/2 months of use. Have contacted customer service many times and they are very slow to respond. Having looked on various forums this appears to be a common issue.
July 27, 2022 | anonymous Beautiful Watch Like the look. Unfortunately, the glass reflects - that could have been solved better. Sleep tracker is unfortunately not usable. If you lie still but sleepless in bed, the time is counted as slept.
July 26, 2022 | anonymous Lasted less than two months Bought my watch on may 16th, arrived two days later, and i was wearing it the 18th. The watch lasted until july 19th. I woke up to a watch face covered and condensation, the watch back came off when i took the watch off. I am yet to here from the seller after contacting the seller, amazon, and withings a week ago. I cant recommend this watch, it wont hold up July 26, 2022 | anonymous The perfect watch for my workday Not overloaded with features, stylish and suitable for wearing with a suit, health functions work perfectly, the app is good and easy to understand. The battery lasts almost forever (about 20-25 days), it's simple. I upgraded it with a metal strap. Clear recommendation.
July 24, 2022 | anonymous Great watch, works well with Google Fit This syncs well with Google Fit on my Pixel 4XL, which is the reason I bought the watch. The ECG feature works for me in Florida, after the initial reading was approved overnight by their Health Partners here in the USA. It appears holding my wrist close to my heart helps get an ECG reading. I use the workout feature to track my time, steps and bpm. I like the stem feature, which is easier to use to scroll through the menus, than the touchscreens on my old Samsung watch. And the watch does not seem to use much power, 79% left after a week of use, much better than the Samsung which had to charged everyday.
July 23, 2022 | anonymous Top all functions so far All functions good so far. Survived water with salt and chlorine. Shockproof and robust. I replaced the original strap with leather. It would be desirable at this price to be able to choose the material of the strap.
July 22, 2022 | anonymous Very satisfied Like it July 22, 2022 | anonymous Reliable Health Check The Withings watch is exactly what I was looking for. It monitors my nightly breathing, pulse, and oxygen saturation. It accurately reflects how I feel at night and in the morning. As an apnea patient, it provides reliable information about my 'current' condition. I only wear it at night. It also has normal functions like time and step counter. It looks like a completely normal inconspicuous wristwatch. I have not regretted the purchase.
July 21, 2022 | anonymous Sleep and Heart Monitoring My watch provides me with important data about my health July 19, 2022 | anonymous Great Health Smart Watch This is a great watch. I find the accuracy to be very good. The app and install were really easy to use.
July 19, 2022 | anonymous A great watch but it was painful to wear There are a lot of great features on this watch but I have a small wrist and it was painful to wear on a daily basis. If they came up with a smaller and thinner version of this watch I would buy it in a heartbeat.
July 19, 2022 | anonymous Just wasn’t as good as the Apple watch After 2 weeks I switched back to the Apple Watch.I had such high hopes.It would probably be great for someone who hasn’t used an Apple Watch for the last 4 years.I just couldn’t adapt to it.
July 17, 2022 | anonymous Beautiful watch, I love it I’ve had the HR watch for years and this nice upgrade to the scanwatch was tight!!It’s sexy, vibrant, light weight, all the tracking stuff is sweet and it’s elegant.The attention to detail with the arms moving out of the way of the screen when you tap into the menus, the crown is so nice and smooth.I’m very very pleasantly surprised and it’s the perfect upgrade that does everything I need.
July 15, 2022 | anonymous Withings ScanWatch - Hybrid Smartwatch with Heart Rate Sensor and Oximeter Nice design. Easy to install. Unfortunately, ECG function is not enabled.
July 14, 2022 | anonymous For anyone who has special risks of heart attack or stroke If you have high blood pressure, take medication, had a family member who had a heart attack or stroke, then this watch is the measure of all things for you. While you sleep, it monitors your pulse rate, sleep, and checks your heartbeat for atrial fibrillation. With the accompanying app, which is intuitive to use with your phone, you have access to essential health data that you can easily transfer as a file to your family doctor or cardiologist. The great thing is the ability to create a simple ECG, which you can also pass on to your doctors. The battery life is more than sufficient. Even with intensive use of the watch, you have two weeks until the next recharge. The bracelet is skin-friendly and easy to clean. I have already recommended the watch several times.
July 10, 2022 | anonymous Recommended Good, subtle watch with many features. The app works well.
July 10, 2022 | anonymous No second In a small firmware update, I would urgently like to have a display with seconds in the Quicklook display - in a larger one also additional time zones.
July 9, 2022 | anonymous Great looking watch I loved the watch's look but returned it because the sleep tracking was very disappointing as was the pulse rate monitor and distance tracker.Specifically, sleep tracker said I ran 1.03 miles in my sleep.Pulse monitor was inaccurate when I really got moving and hit my maximum heart rate.And the distance monitor said I walked 3.75 miles when I know for a fact it was 4 miles.So, appearance was great.Functionality and tracking...not so much July 8, 2022 | anonymous Excellent Watch So I love this watch. The style is beautiful with minimalist features. The real gem is the data that is collected. This watch has it all. Now my complaint. I ordered through Amazon usa but live outside USA. The ECG feature requires approval from the USA medical profession in your state or it doesn't work. It is unfortunate this company is being held hostage to the medical profession when in Europe the feature is open. Too bad. I recommend you do not but from USA.
July 6, 2022 | anonymous Super quality best of its kind July 5, 2022 | anonymous Can recommend On the whole, I like the watch. At the beginning, there were major problems. I almost threw the watch and smartphone out of the window. It took me a whole day to make the watch work properly.
July 5, 2022 | anonymous Features NOT available if you buy the version that sells in Canada.
I bought this watch 2 months ago to follow up on my AFib and SO2 and I found out that those functions not available in Canada. So I returned the watch back to Amazon and bought an european version from e-bay, which arrived in about a week. ECG, Afib sensor and SO2 sensors working very well and I am very happy July 5, 2022 | anonymous Flawless, the watch meets my expectations The watch constantly surprises me with its hints and support. I mainly use it for sports and to have a certain incentive, but I don't have to achieve top performance. For me, the watch is a good monitoring of BPM and controlled performance under stress. Regardless, I am often asked about the good design of the watch. Most people are not aware that this is a smartwatch.
July 1, 2022 | anonymous Chicke Uhr From the warehouse. Condition is very good.
June 27, 2022 | anonymous great autonomy for a smartwatch just what I needed June 27, 2022 | anonymous Product and Service Product is as described; processing is easy and uncomplicated.
June 26, 2022 | anonymous Spitzenuhr, but...
Everything exactly as desired. Watch was unfortunately returned because the Bluetooth connection demanded constant attention June 25, 2022 | anonymous Does NOT tell you if you have AFib (in the US) I generally like the watch. I bought it mainly for health monitoring, so I didn't care if doesn't do everything that a smart phone can, and it looks like a watch.BUT because I may suffer from AFib (atrial fibrillation), which is diagnosed by means of an electrocardiogram (ECG), I thought this is the watch for me. I can monitor my heart rhythm and determine when or if I have AFib.Well, it turns out that if you buy the ScanWatch in the United States, you will not be able to get a 'signs of AFib' notification from the device after it reads your heart rhythm. That notification simply does not exist on the US model for legal reasons. Consequently, you will only get a 'normal' reading or an 'inconclusive' reading. If 'normal,' then there were presumably no signs of AFib. But if 'inconclusive,' you will basically still be in the dark. Lots of factors can affect whether the reading is inconclusive. One of those is AFib. Of course, you could learn how to read and interpret the ECG yourself...Now, if you buy your ScanWatch in Europe. You WILL receive 'signs of AFib' notifications when the device detects AFib. Withings Support has confirmed the above to me by email. Their service was prompt and helpful, but the upshot is ultimately disappointing because being able to positively detect signs of AFib was my most important reason for buying the product. Now, I just have to infer or guess.And the by the way, they also confirm that the regional US ScanWatch cannot be reconfigured if you move to another part of the world where the AFib detection feature is supported. So, I recommend buying and configuring your ScanWatch in Europe or other region where the feature is supported (there is a list of regions on the website, but you have to dig for it).I'm keeping the watch, but relying on the Alivecor KardiaMobile device (not a watch) to give better readings (1 or 6 lead) with more specific notifications (it will tell you if it detects possible signs of AFib). And it is significantly cheaper than the already inexpensive ScanWatch.
June 25, 2022 | anonymous A very beautiful well-crafted watch The watch looks very good, I have the 42mm watch.
June 24, 2022 | anonymous Beautiful but impractical The Scanwatch is a really beautiful watch, which sets it apart from other smartwatches. The small display is super easy to read and the jump of the hands at 10 past 10 also provides clarity at noon :-) Unfortunately, the watch is not usable for me in everyday life. The notifications are displayed as a ticker for about 12 seconds and then disappear. 'Disappear' in the sense of: the watch never shows them again. This of course also applies to all messages that have been received on the smartphone while the watch was outside the Bluetooth connection. Therefore, I reluctantly returned it, as the everyday usability of a watch is much more important to me than the fitness/health functions.
June 22, 2022 | anonymous Gefällt Great watch. Price-performance ratio I.O June 18, 2022 | anonymous Good Quality Smartwatch Good Quality Smartwatch that works flawlessly with my iPhone. Great for identifying atrial fibrillation. My cardiologist was really impressed with the print out graph results.
June 17, 2022 | anonymous The watch does what it's supposed to do, I like it, flawless function.
The recording of the watch in the app is clear, EKG recording is also fine, the watch looks good, really good. The only thing I have to criticize is that there are two small scratches on the bottom of the watch in the metal stainless steel case, otherwise flawless.
June 16, 2022 | anonymous Theoretically yes, practically no the model I chose in black Withings ScanWatch Hybrid Smartwatch with ECG, heart rate sensor and oximeter. It has a few weaknesses for me, which led me to return it. The most important point for me is that the watch glass is slightly curved but unfortunately not anti-reflective, so the watch can only be read very poorly. The operation is simple and precise by pressing and turning the bezel. Unfortunately, the entire description was only in English. The app is okay once it is set up, there are clearer ones, but you can certainly get used to it. The measured data, as far as comparable, were relatively similar to others. However, the weight of the watch is not so great, you also have to get used to it. All in all, unfortunately nothing for me.
June 15, 2022 | anonymous Recommended Everything is great, accepted by the cardiologist.
June 14, 2022 | anonymous Great watch! I got thu watch for all that it does!! It’s beautiful, easy to use, and valuable!! EKG, O2 Sat and sleep monitoring is great!! June 14, 2022 | anonymous Great looking smart watch All the necessary functions of a smart watch in the body of an normal watch. The strap, the body and the glass are great quality too. I had no scratches at all after more than a year wearing it.
June 13, 2022 | anonymous Great looking fitness watch that tracks everything you need to track.
This has been great so far.
June 12, 2022 | anonymous Super Watch Very satisfied June 11, 2022 | anonymous Very nice and elegant love it, very elegant and comfortable.Though it seems like my phone gives me more 'steps' than the watch, but whatever.
June 6, 2022 | anonymous Was disappointed watch does not support RTL languages Was disapponted watch does not support RTL languages June 5, 2022 | anonymous Sensors, Style, Sensibility! Pros:* 30 day charge if you don't use the Blood 02 Sensor, or a 7 day charge if you do, both of which are considerably longer than the 18 hour battery life of an Apple Watch. In my case, sleep monitoring with my Apple Watch saw many interruptions because the watch wasn't charged enough to last the night. With the Withings ScanWatch, I just charge it every Sunday and leave the 02 sensor on the whole week.* HealthMate is a very good app, with a lot of well-presented data, and it syncs with Apple Health, myFitnessPal, and Strava, to cover diet and exercise pretty well.* Stylish enough that you can wear it out to events. There's other bands (just like the Apple Watch), but the actual watch face is also considerably better looking than virtually all the Apple Watch faces I tried.* Part of a larger Withings ecosystem, so the Health Mate app integrates with Sleep Apnoea pads, blood pressure cuffs, smart scales, smart thermometers, etc. to track multiple aspects of your health collectively, and easily.Cons:* No ECG feature in Canada. Withings chose to get FDA approved in the US and NHS approved in the EU for their ECG function, an extra step which then requires a doctor's sign off on its use. The extra step gives you more certainty with the results, but until there's a medical body or bodies that approve it in the same way in Canada, the ECG feature will not be available.* The 42mm size is relatively heavy and large. Smaller men and most women will probably want to stick to the 38mm size.* GPS function is slaved to your phone, so if you want mapping for your runs or rides you'll want to have your phone with you.* Step counter tends to need stronger, discrete steps to count them, so if you shuffle because of mobility issues, you'll see a discrepancy between your ScanWatch and your iPhone step count.* If you get up in the middle of the night, the sleep tracking will usually stop. Withings says it takes 150 steps for this to happen, but I've walked 5 steps to get a drink, and 5 steps back, and it still stopped measuring my sleep and assumed I was up for good.
June 5, 2022 | anonymous Very high quality and visually very beautiful This was a gift for my sister who has to monitor certain cardiological values due to a heart disease. She was thrilled with the design and functionality. She found the app very intuitive and informative. Above all, she found the sleep analysis excellent. Since then, the watch has been her constant companion. She has received many compliments from her colleagues at work.
June 4, 2022 | anonymous I don’t know if it’s accurate, but I like the watch This is my second withings watch.I like seeing the phone messages from my kids without looking at my phone.Works well with the apple health.I don’t use all the other features but I’m glad to know I’m sleeping and breathing.Challenge for me is that I keep misplacing the charger… the older version was battery operated.It’s a great watch, if you are tidy.
June 4, 2022 | anonymous Totally satisfied with Withings Scan Watch Large face, clear display, health data I want, no 'frills' (calls, texts, battery-draining graphics) I don't want or need. App working well for me so far! June 2, 2022 | anonymous Good function, but very dark dial.
The watch is good in terms of function, but I returned it because the dial is very dark. It doesn't look visually appealing and it's difficult to read the time.
June 1, 2022 | anonymous Accurately capturing health data I am very impressed with the quality of the Withings measurement. I measured my heartbeat with a blood pressure monitor and the Withings showed exactly the same value. The measurement of sleep quality also seems very good and matches my perceptions. The steps are accurately recorded. The transfer of data to the app is very good and clear. The timer function is easy to use and also accurate, but more suitable for occasional use.
June 1, 2022 | anonymous HELPFUL SMART/MEDICAL WATCH ECG WORKED PERFECT HELPING DOCTOR DEFINE MY HEART PROBLEM June 1, 2022 | anonymous All the best! The watch is very good! May 31, 2022 | anonymous A wonderful watch The best health watch. Measures heart rate, saturation, makes a cardiogram of the heart. My battery lasts over 20 days, which is great. And last but not least - very beautiful, especially with the metal chain. I recommend.
May 30, 2022 | anonymous Great watch Download the app and you're ready to go, simple and step-by-step instructions May 29, 2022 | anonymous Digits and hands difficult to read Elegant watch but difficult to read May 29, 2022 | anonymous Good job from your side Nice app May 29, 2022 | anonymous Fantastic watch and very accurate.
This watch using the android app connects to my Samsung S21 5g Smart Phone.It keeps accurate track of my sleep pattern, heart rate and provides a heart monitor through the app and also an evaluation on the watch itself.It monitors for afib.It also monitors the number of steps and floors I take each 24 hr period.It also monitors for breathing abnormalities.The battery life is stellar, though I don't think it will quite last a month.I am one day short of two weeks and am at 41%, still fantastic for a smart watch.It charges up relatively fast.
May 29, 2022 | anonymous Too expensive for the performance Does not record GPS data May 28, 2022 | anonymous Ordinary smartwatch in analog look Overall, I am satisfied. What bothers me is the step recognition, which deviates significantly from fitness apps on my Huawei 30 pro. The watch assigns me suspiciously many steps. When selecting the 'walking' workout, only the distance covered is displayed in connection with the GPS of my smartphone, but not the steps, which an intelligent software could use to determine the average step length. It could therefore be that the otherwise well-made app does not 'learn', but only takes into account the body size and weight entered in the profile in the algorithm. Then the watch almost daily thinks it recognizes a bike tour with me, even though I haven't moved my bike. The health functions are convincing: sleep analysis, ECG, pulse, blood oxygen saturation. The battery life is top, the Bluetooth connection to the Android phone is problem-free.
May 28, 2022 | anonymous Withing Scan Watch Delivers what it promises. But I am still trying and learning.
May 27, 2022 | anonymous Geniale Uhr I have been using the watch for about 2 months now and I am very impressed! It creates a nice compromise between smartwatch / fitness tracker and analog watch. It is very high quality and the control via the dial on the side is very pleasant. I get about 20 days of battery life with daily use and wearing it at night.
May 26, 2022 | anonymous Stylish but bulky I've tracked withing watches for 5 years, waiting for the right watch to buy. I bought the blue Scan watch, and that thing is pretty.The sleep tracking is not great. The things it counts as interruptions are not good. For a gentle sleeper, i think the watch's reading will be more accurate. I'm a wild sleeper, and the reading is wrong.The watch is also a bit bulkier than I like my watches to be. But I guess that's the best current technology can achieve for now.I also do not like that it does not work count my steps in real-time like my old Microsoft Band 2 used to.All in all, I really got the watch because of its style. A smartwatch that looks like a regular watch. So, I'll keep it.
May 26, 2022 | anonymous Withings ScanWatch Super fast delivery and everything works great.
May 25, 2022 | anonymous immer wieder Without ifs and buts May 23, 2022 | anonymous Looks good, but not accurate I love the way the watch looks but the step counter is way off - sometimes 50percent lower than my Iphone counter.I have even done a test:walked 50 steps and Iphone recorded 48 and scanwatch got 36. And I wear the watch tightly (enough so that it leaves and impression on my arm).I like the sleep app - it seems accurate, but I don’t really have a way to test it.
May 22, 2022 | anonymous Excellent Battery life! About my most favorite watches! May 22, 2022 | anonymous Watch and Health A very nice watch with special features such as ECG, heart rate sensor, and oximeter. With the recorded values, you get a very good insight into your own health status. I can print out the values and take them to the doctor. Of course, it is not about the individual value, but about the recordings that I can print out or send directly to my doctor by email. However, the mobile app occasionally has quirks that need to be fixed. I am very satisfied with the watch! May 21, 2022 | anonymous High-quality watch The watch is of very high quality. The battery actually lasts for 4 weeks if functions such as ECG and oxygen saturation are not used too frequently. With frequent use, the battery charge reduces to about 3 weeks. A clear advantage over the Apple Watch. The purchase price is also significantly lower. The time is displayed with real hands. The watch works with Android and Apple iOS. The wristbands can be easily exchanged.
May 20, 2022 | anonymous Old stock but work fantastic The watch was probably stored on shelf for few years, battery came drained. Took about 36 hr to charge fully and then time decrease. Takes about less than 1 hours from 40% to 100% now. Still no ECG. Last about a week and change on one charge with everything on. Tracks well and simple/convenient to use. Overall looks, very sleek and professional. App could be little more intuitive but it keeps the record properly. Mainly only issue was, I didn’t know how long it was sitting on a shelf before I got it and the app, but after a month using the watch. I really like it.
May 20, 2022 | anonymous Total satisfaction A super great thing, everything I have done and recorded fits together, I find the sleep analysis totally amazing May 19, 2022 | anonymous Recommended For those who like to wear watches and at the same time keep track of their fitness, this is a great alternative to Apple Watch and similar products. It looks stylish and has many features. Comes in a high-quality design. Enjoy! May 18, 2022 | anonymous Clock is getting delayed I bought it because the design is cute. Even if I adjust the hands or adjust it with the app, the time gradually gets delayed. It will be fixed if synchronized with the smartphone, but I synchronize it four times a day. It is inconvenient if the most important clock function cannot be trusted.
May 18, 2022 | anonymous Successful blend of a timeless beautiful watch and a fitness watch I am not going to write about the many functions, which all work without exception, and are constantly measuring accurately when the watch is properly fitted. This applies to ECG and oxygen saturation measurement, and pulse measurement also works with a slightly loose bracelet, which I find more comfortable in the long run, without any problems. Before an ECG or oxygen saturation measurement, I slide the bracelet (now switched to leather) 1 to 2cm up the arm until it fits tightly, then it always works with reproducible results. The app works flawlessly on the iPhone, is clear and visually appealing, just like the watch. The data is also transferred to Apple Health, if allowed. A word about battery life: I wear the watch 24/7, which is why the battery lasts 2-3 weeks for me, as I train 3-4 times a week and the pulse measurement runs during that time, and occasionally additional measurements run at night in automatic mode. I have turned off the display activation when lifting. In my opinion, the price for the overall package including sapphire glass and app, which has to be updated over the years, is really cheap. I would buy the watch again immediately.
May 17, 2022 | anonymous Long battery life.
Good:Long battery life, accurate sensors(ECG/Heart rate/Oximeter), Good design, Support Asian (Korean) SMS display.Bad:Limited band variation. (It use 18mm band), Limited GPS tracking during exercise.
May 16, 2022 | anonymous A watch with a sensor suite, not a 'smartwatch' I dislike looking like an extra on Buck Rogers with a dinner-plate size watch hanging off my wrist. So smartwatches that look like sci-fi props don't interest me. I got turned on to the Withings ScanWatch by its (relatively) small size, only 38mm diameter, compared to the common 44-48mm 'dinner plate' watches currently popular. The other thing that appealed was the sensor were supposed to be certified by the FDA: BPM, PulseOX, and ECG. Other smartwatches will do it, but are not 'certified' to be used as what is effectively a medical device.I like the fact that I control my data, can send it off to my Doctor at will, and I'm not upcharged for any features. I love the subtlety of the watch, where most people are not even aware it has a sensor package or notifications, or timers, or stopwatches, etc.What I dislike is that notifications are the only Phone to Watch communication. If receiving a text, just the ability to rotate the crown to send back one of three responses (e.g. Yes, No, Eggs [or whatever]) would be a huge improvement. Also, I think there are many more onboard functions that the computer is capable of, but only the basics have been explored.I think Withings has a great start. But the sensor functions are not always accurate, easy to use, or well explained HOW they gather their data (such as sleep tracking) so you will often get bizarre readings from it that would not be tolerated in a true 'medical device.' So 10/10 for style, but 5/10 for creative thinkingfor everything the watch COULD do.
May 16, 2022 | anonymous All that is important to me.
I was looking for a watch that would alert me to urgent messages from my phone, BUT is just a watch and not a phone on my arm. Everything is great! The battery life is 4 weeks despite using all the features, fantastic! A subtle vibration indicates a message or call. It doesn't bother me when I'm busy. (No strong light or sound signal) The message is no longer retrievable, so if you missed the short message on the watch, you have to check it on your phone. For me, it's not a problem because I use the phone to reply and make calls anyway. The monitoring of heart function and sleep analysis is interesting. I don't really need it, but it's quite interesting. The GPS doesn't work or the watch can't do it, the distance traveled is calculated from the steps. Personally, I don't want GPS monitoring on my arm, it's enough if the phone does it. I will buy it again and give it as a gift.
May 14, 2022 | anonymous No access Unfortunately, no access to the setup with the button. It turns on and I can register the watch on my phone and the software, but that's it. Can't access the watch's setup. So, back to square one! May 14, 2022 | anonymous Notification sometimes doesn't come I basically use it for health management in conjunction with other Withings products, so notifications are secondary, but this is not good. Sometimes notifications don't come, so I use this product almost as a watch. Not smart lol.
May 14, 2022 | anonymous Versatile and Stylish Okay, I had an ounce of skeptisim about this watch. Now I don't. First off, this is more of a health- monitor/ information watch than. An activity tracker. Withings is going up against some heavy hitters that have established themselves in the activity tracking market. The health monitor segment is not as well know or developed so that's where they have placed their product trying to obtain a market share. That market segment is for young active people who are into the tracking their workout regiment. This watch will do that but it goes beyond that. It tracks your sleep and gives you insite to your overall health using the associated app. I am 61 so I'm not concerned with the little bit of exercise I do. It encourages me to do more but my real concern is my overall health status and catching changes early or being aware of the small changes that happen that can give me an indication something may be going wrong. That's where this watch excells. It tracks data points that help you to self monitor your health. The ECGand SPO2 monitor give you that information in combination with the sleep tracking that gives an overall picture as to what is going on. They seem to be accurate and you can set them to automatically monitor or you can manually monitor.Which brings me to another thing I like about this watch. I have a smart phone that is able to work as a laptop. That's a lot of information I can assimilate all day long. Smart watches try and cram all of that info onto your wrist, that not what I want. I want to distill my daily interruptions down to what is important. I set my notifications only to the email accounts I have to keep track of ,text messages and calls from two separate phone numbers. They stream across thescreen and I can briefly look at them and decide if I need to pick pick up my phone or go to my tablet to look at the complete message. This feature is not talked about hardly any at all by Withings but it is a strong point of the watch. And it does it with style.And my final point is I am not of the age where flash attracts my attention. Tasteful appointment catches my eye more than anything else.This is the final strong point of this watch. The subtly of the watch catches everyone off guard. I don't want people to ask or know I have the latest gadget. Rather the surprise that it is more than a watch is a conversation starter.My wife has seen it and wants one now. I'm going to pick up one for her and get a second rose gold with the blue face for wearing at evening events that are more formal.Final point, as I write this I received my watch and charged it on April 28th. I now have30% battery left. I have been working through all of the features so I have used it more than I probably will in the future. No complaints about battery life.This watch opens up an entirely new market segment that has not been exploited by any of the other hybrid or smart watch manufacturers. I look forward to seeing the new products they bring out.
May 10, 2022 | anonymous Like the watch a lot when it is Fully Working! For two month it did everything it claimed but then it stopped reporting my Sleeping Breathing disturbances.After several communications via email and sending videos and photos with their service department, (Which did respond in a timely manner) I was told the problem would be address in the next software update. Now that could be a long time coming and I believe the last software update may have caused this feature to stop.I still wear the watch in hopes that the update will come and fix the issue but I think their solution was lacking and a working watch should have been sent to replace it. I have many watches and put them aside because of the promised features of this watch.If and when the watch starts fully working again I will gladly adjust my rating, but to fail after just 2 months at this price point I can’t give it more than 1 stars because it now lacks the feature that I primary purchased it for.If this feature I purchased for is not restored within a reasonable amount of time, I will pursue other steps to have Withings honor their 2 warranty.So my watch received the new software update around 5-17-22 and the feature I purchased it for is again working. Withings Kept their word so I'm now keeping mind and elevating my review to 5 Stars.As the headline states I Like this Watch a lot when it's Fully Working!As or 5-22-22 working - Thank You Withings Tech...
May 10, 2022 | anonymous Too bad! Actually, it's a great watch, because the impression when unpacking is really excellent. However, 2 points really bothered me and triggered the return: 1. the Bluetooth connection to the phone was interrupted many times (and it was not the phone's fault) and 2. if I don't want notifications at night, I have to manually set this every time (!) on the watch or in the app and again the next morning, etc. That's annoying! I found the health measurements quite okay; however, it became questionable for me whether I need them daily or absolutely want them displayed.
May 9, 2022 | anonymous Sporty elegant Smartwatch I already had the Withings (Nokia) in gold and bought this one additionally for everyday use. I replaced the silicone band with a black Milanese Loop. Looks better and is much more comfortable to wear. Smart functions are top-notch and the watch looks like an IWC! Syncs perfectly with Google Fit.
May 9, 2022 | anonymous Great features, short durability The watch is great in principle. Unfortunately, it broke after half a year for me. The minute hand no longer moves. There are also others who have experienced the same thing. A Google search helps. Thanks to Amazon, I got a refund.
May 7, 2022 | anonymous ScanWatch Watch works great, highly recommended May 7, 2022 | anonymous Replace from SteelHR I replaced it because the display of SteelHR was broken. It doesn't get cloudy! I stick to this. I feel like the battery life is decreasing faster than SteelHR because of the added functions. I just started using it, so I'll keep an eye on it while cutting out unnecessary functions. The quality of the vibration is good. The resolution of OLED has also increased and it is easy to see! May 5, 2022 | anonymous Very satisfied Works perfectly May 4, 2022 | anonymous Clear functions Very beautiful watch May 3, 2022 | anonymous Early review but happy so far I'm an Apple everything user and wore an Apple Watch series 4 for a few years but recently traded it in. When wearing the Apple Watch, while I (mostly) liked all the integration, I often found myself wishing I had a nicer looking watch (especially for dressier times). I also found that the Apple Watch offered a little too much and could be distracting with all of its features and alerts. Since the series 4 didn't have an always on display, I found night time driving annoying because it would constantly light up and be distracting while moving my arms around. Yes, I know I could disable the 'wake display on arm raise' feature but, with no other way to see the time (other than pushing the button), this was the setting I liked most of the time; so I left it that way at night too.Anyhow, I thought I'd give this watch a shot since it looked so much nicer and I didn't need any light up displays to simply see what time it was. The fact that this model has an FDA cleared ECG and SPo2 feature is a bargain compared to what it costs for that on the Apple Watch. I've had the watch for only a few days but have been happy with it so far. Very easysetup, super quick to tell time, I can get a simple vibration alert when a phone call or text comes in (all selectable), track exercise, HR, SPo2, etc. Even if I get 15 of the 30 promised days of battery life then that is better than the average 1 day battery life on an Apple Watch. So far, I'm happy with the trade offs that had to be made to make this a nice looking watch with long battery life.I tried both the 42mm and 38mm watch. I'm a 5'9' 165 pound male and have a 17cm wrist circumference. While the 42mm looks a little big on me, the 38mm doesn't really look all that smaller to me. Personally, I liked the brushed nickel look, more detailed watch face, and easier to see hands of the 42mm over the (shiny finish and less detailed face of the) 38mm but that's all personal preference. Biggest issue for me is that the band is pretty big on me and has a lot of extra length that shows. I'll probably order a different band at some point.
May 1, 2022 | anonymous Malfunction occurred in about 3 months I purchased it and in less than 3 months, the menu stopped moving even when I turned the knob. I inquired twice but did not receive a reply for over a month. I was very disappointed because I liked using it.
May 1, 2022 | anonymous Serves its purpose First of all, I bought this watch as a Christmas present for my father (72 years old) because he has always wanted a fitness watch. Now that he has been using it for 4 months, I can give a first conclusion. My father is enthusiastic about his watch and except for the problem that the SPO2 function is not usable because apparently an additional measuring device is needed, he also uses almost all functions extensively. He is also always happy about the report that the app sends him at regular intervals and keeps a record of his self-measured values. So far, he has had no problems with the watch except after an update, but the problem was quickly solved after I explained to him what he had to do after such an update. I would give my father this watch again at any time.
April 29, 2022 | anonymous A work in progress I enjoy Withings products in general, but am not impressed with the ScanWatch. I've been using it for more than two months, while I worked through a running program and visit a trainer twice per month.My biggest issues have been with the heart rate. This watch is simply not functional as a fitness tracker. No heart rate data has been recorded for any runs I've completed, and only two or three times has the watch automatically recorded a workout. Those two or three times happened to be when I was walking across a street, not working out.Additionally, with my trainer, we monitor heart rate closely. My ScanWatch is often off by 100 BPM, showing 61 BPM during intense cardio. This is dangerous.I love the look of the watch and am very regretful that I can't continue to use it as a fitness tracker. But overall, I can't give this product a positive review, as it does not fulfill what it advertises to do.
April 29, 2022 | anonymous Easy to use Can only recommend this watch in every way April 28, 2022 | anonymous Can't get any better...
I ordered the watch at 10:00 pm in the evening and received it the next day at 10:00 am. Unpacked, charged (1h), connected to my phone, made some settings, put on the watch, took measurements, done! The watch looks elegant and stylish, the materials are well processed and it can be worn on any occasion. My expectations are 100% fulfilled. It can't get any better than this. Clear recommendation to buy. Thanks to Withings and Amazon for the great performance! April 27, 2022 | anonymous Much more elegant, straightforward and uncomplicated alternative to Apple Watch After five years with Apple Watch’s ever more complicated interface, notifications and an unwieldy and crowded Health App, the ScanWatch and it’s companion app are a breath of fresh air. More accurate and less intrusive (and many times annoying Apple Watch) plus, it looks much better.
April 27, 2022 | anonymous Watch is great, but too big for me After returning it, I did not receive a full refund. I am not a customer who returns items lightly. I found no other way to send this message.
April 25, 2022 | anonymous Good product.
Very nice and good but in Chile there is no way to connect to perform ECG and O2 monitoring. I'm figuring out how to do it.
April 24, 2022 | anonymous So close … There was so much to like about this watch and because of the high expectations, I felt the let down was even higher.This is my first smart watch and I gave it a shot because I am an old school analog watch kind of person and this watch did not look like a smart watch.I cared mostly about the sleep monitoring negate that is mostly what I bought this for.It did a decent job but every now and then it seemed to think I slept more than I did.Mini m minor gripe I guess considering I didn’t have much else to compare to.What I was most upset about was that the actual time was out of sync way too often. It’s simple to sync it back with the app, but why is a watch’s primary function so poor?It happened first when the battery was low so I guess I could understand.After a recharge and sync, time was accurate again. However, long before it approached 50% next time around the time was out of sync again. Why?This is all while the watch was worn regularly, almost 24/7 for 4 weeks.Needless to say, very disappointing and not recommended.
April 23, 2022 | anonymous If you are looking for a watch for health check this model is the best choice. The watch gives a very sophisticated and technically good impression. Since this is not a classic smartwatch or an outdoor tracking watch, one should refrain from having expectations for other services and use the great advantage of ECG, oxygen saturation or heart rate measurement. If you are still looking for a good replacement strap 20mm with quick release, you will have a great watch in the end.
April 21, 2022 | anonymous Finally a fitness watch that looks like a watch Great battery life, superb design and features! Unfortunately, it cannot be connected to the Fitbit scale April 20, 2022 | anonymous Great Hybrid Smartwatch Watch! This is a great watch. I had a previous version and traded up because I wanted the FDA approved AFIB and more visible hands. The features and design are improved. The traditional round face is my preference and the 42mm wears well. I had Fitbit also, that fell on the ground and the glass broke, oops. This is a sapphire glass, water resistant, and the multitude of tracking features, including GPS, make this a go to for me. Oh, and the 30-day battery life is amazing.
April 19, 2022 | anonymous Good SmartWatch The functions seem to work really well and correctly. Only the pedometer does not work properly in the apartment. However, this works perfectly during workouts. Overall, a clear purchase recommendation if you value accurate measurements. The functions are easily accessible and the synchronization with the app is also very good. I am overall very satisfied.
April 18, 2022 | anonymous The watch doesn't look like a smartwatch, the DESIGN is just amazing I bought the watch on the recommendation of my cardiologist because it can do an EKG. He has the same one and gave me a demonstration that convinced me. My predecessor, the GT2, could do a lot more, for example, it had GPS; phone, well, this one gets it from the smartphone, but without the smartphone nearby, nothing worked on the GT2 either. I just tried it out, did an EKG and transmitted it to the cardiologist, and the answer came after 15 minutes. Everything is OK with you. That's already okay and saves long waiting times and appointments. The future has begun.
April 11, 2022 | anonymous Great health watch with a different philosophy The media could not be loaded. Great hybrid watch with a different approach on what should be a connected timepiece.This is not a « screen watch » with all the apps and notifications (read distractions). It’s a watch made to be one and look like one, with real analog clock hands and a clean small round display. That’s all you need.Flawless minimalistic design, great construction quality and very comfortable.So far love the health tracking main features: sleep, steps and Spo2. (ecg not available yet in Canada). App connects to Apple Health. Battery life is amazing.Very pleased with Withings, great purchase.
April 11, 2022 | anonymous Overall good, sleep tracking needs work So first is all, this is a great watch. The battery life compared to my old Fitbit is spectacular. The main issue I've run into is the sleep tracking isn't very accurate. It misses when I'm clearly awake, and it always overshoots when I wake up by up to an hour.
April 9, 2022 | anonymous Beautiful watch, fitness functions not mature I have owned the watch since November 2021 and have always operated it with the latest software available. I would like to rate the watch better, but unfortunately, the recognition of fitness activities and tracking is significantly worse than, for example, with Garmin. Design Very successful, restrained design, very pleasing. The small display is not noticeable when switched off. Function The operation is well thought out and sufficient for the provided functions. The display of the individual values in the app is very clear. Battery life With permanent pulse monitoring, I get at least 14 days of battery life, which I find sufficient for everyday use. Workouts with GPS recording via the phone significantly drain the battery. Fitness functions Automatic recognition of workouts is weak, the same cycling route on the way back is recognized, but not on the way there. Calorie calculation for cycling workouts is a joke, apparently a fixed value per sport and hour is assumed and interpolated. A 45 km cycling event with longer recording should consume more energy than, for example, a 76 km tour where the recording was shorter. The values are more realistic with Garmin. I hope the health functions are better matured.
April 8, 2022 | anonymous Best Smartwatch I've been using this watch for a few months now and I'm still totally convinced. It looks like a normal simple watch and many people are very surprised by what it can do. But why should I care what others think? Well, okay...so you can wear it with an evening dress but also when mountain biking😉The range of functions is great. I don't use it for sleeping, but I use all the other functions. The pedometer, which motivates me to take the little extra loop every day, is just as integrated into my everyday life as the discreet timer when I don't want to use my smartphone. Using it during sports is also great. The battery life is amazing. Sometimes you forget that you even have to charge it. But the watch reminds you 😉I have to look for the flaws for so long that I can't deduct any stars for them. For outdoor sports with potential contact with stones, a protective film makes sense so that the glass does not get scratched. Sometimes my phone doesn't connect to the watch (but it could also be the smartphone). The Withings app does not include inline skating as a sport. In training mode, the date and time are not displayed on the screen. Afterwards, I can only recommend this smartwatch to everyone.
April 8, 2022 | anonymous Sleep tracking did not work for me.
The mobile app was okay, but it loses the direct comparison with the Huawei Health app due to the worse overview. The battery life is already enormous. All functions of the watch worked well except for sleep tracking. Sleep is only recorded after a duration of 3 hours. According to the forum, there are always problems here. That's why I reluctantly returned my watch.
April 5, 2022 | anonymous Long-term measurement and ECG feasible I have been wearing the watch for almost a month now. The battery still lasts. The watch detects physical activities and transfers them to the app. The ECG has also worked so far. I only gave the timer 3 stars because I haven't used it yet. Usually, I use the timer on my smartphone. Anyway, for the price, it's a great health watch and I would like to recommend it.
April 5, 2022 | anonymous Doesn't do well in Heat I like to monitor my heart rate when I am taking Hot Yoga and or in the Sauna. I've been doing this for years with my Fitbits.However, after one sauna session with the Withing, the inside of the glass fogged up and the battery then quickly discharged.Now the dial no longer works.I am hoping this was just a defective unit.The build quality on these watches is amazing and the batter life is phenomenal. I've sent in the unit for exchange.I'll write another review to let you know if the replacement holds up.
April 4, 2022 | anonymous Withings ScanWatch Very nice and elegant watch, I saw it at Saturn and wanted to take it with me for my wife immediately, unfortunately I couldn't buy the watch because it was a single piece. I ordered the watch on Amazon on Friday and the delivery was already there on Saturday. My wife is very enthusiastic and satisfied.
April 3, 2022 | anonymous Many ways to monitor your health The smartwatch has many useful features and the battery actually lasts long. I would buy it again.
April 3, 2022 | anonymous A beautiful and slick health watch with one limitation This is a beautiful and slick health watch. I've worn it for 5 days and it's very worthwhile. I considered other 'smart' watches but in the end, since I've had some health problems (history of afib although no issues for the past 7 years), I settled on the Withings Scan watch instead. The watch deserves its good reviews. The watch itself is pretty straightforward to operate, and the Health Mate app is well laid out and functions properly on my Android One Plus phone.I chose the smaller version of the watch and it fits my 7.25 inch wrist just fine. The strap it came with has plenty of adjustment either way.A couple ofinitial hiccups getting the watch to connect via bluetooth, but since then it connects and syncs with Health Mate very quickly every time. The one limitation: As of this date, Withings has not yet obtained U.S. approval for 'afib' or 'irregular heart beat' messages (although the ECG function works OK after I sent in the trial recording, getting approval just a few hours later).Hopefully this messaging function is pending for the U.S., since it has already been approved in a number of other countries (see the Withings web site). Have to wait and see, I guess. At least there is the functioning ECG. For now, if you can live with just the ECG minus the 'interpretation' I highly recommend the Scan Watch.
March 30, 2022 | anonymous Reliable even if simple This is a review after using it for about 3 months. In my case, I can use it for about 3 weeks to 1 month after charging, and it has a very good battery life. It's almost impossible to take it off, but personally, I feel a sense of openness when I take it off during charging. Maybe the belt doesn't fit me well. It will be solved by replacing it with a belt that suits me.
March 30, 2022 | anonymous A mechanical looking watch with all the digital adds on.
Great so far, easy to connect, works perfectly with my Apple phone. Battery life I get 10 to 15 days max March 28, 2022 | anonymous Brilliant smartwatch with room for improvement Been using this smartwatch for the last couple of months:I really love the form factor and functionalities and I am really amazed with the battery life.The companion app is very good also, with a lot of helpful information to check: the ECG works great.I think there is room for improvement regarding two aspects:1. NotificationsIf you don't check the notification when it arrives, it's gone forever and you have to check it in your phone. There are other hybrids smartwatches that have an specific option to check for previous notifications, and it's very useful. Hope Withings implement this sooner than later.2. Step counterI always walk the same circuit every morning and I have about 10% less steps with this smartwatch and with my Galaxy watch 4. I also check again a Mobvoi watch and both (Galaxy and Mobvoi) are closer together (less tan 1% difference) compared with the Withings watch.Anyway it's a great smartwatch and I plan to keep using it.
March 28, 2022 | anonymous great appearance, perfect for work I love the product. The ease of use, it's intuitive nature. It looks like a regular watch-quite stylish in my opinion, but it functions like a smart watch but with just the essentials that I need. If you are regularly using the smart watch functions with blue tooth to your phone--the battery life is closer to two weeks than a month.
March 26, 2022 | anonymous Almost perfect I am satisfied with the functionality, texture, and design, but when I bend my wrist, the crown is pressed and the display is unnecessarily shown. As a result, it is disappointing that the battery is consumed meaninglessly. I want the operation to change the lock function of the crown or the operation to display the display when the crown is pressed.
March 26, 2022 | anonymous Unbeatable battery - functional hybrid smartwatch with potential I bought the watch because I find the design very discreet and as a hybrid smartwatch it is not immediately recognizable. The white dial looks more elegant for my taste - but a black dial makes the OLED display much more inconspicuous. Compared to the 42mm model, the watch is more delicate but also lighter, which is noticeable on the wrist. I tried on the 42mm model for comparison. What I like better about the 42mm is the brushed case and the fact that the hands release the view of the display when pressure is applied to the crown, which they do not do on the 38mm models. I find that very unfortunate, the hands of the 38mm are thinner, but sometimes they also stand above the display, which does not significantly impair readability. Despite running training and multiple daily push notifications and measurements, the battery lasted almost 3 weeks. You can certainly do more. Compared to the Apple Watch, the long battery life is a blessing. What I didn't like was the display of incoming messages, which only run as a ticker due to the small display (which can take a very long time) and the fact that these push notifications cannot be displayed again. That means once missed, you have to reach for your smartphone. The measurement of pulse and O2 were pretty much identical when compared to the Apple Watch. During running training, I would have liked the pulse and time or distance to be displayed permanently on the screen - unfortunately this is not the case. However, synchronization with Strava worked well for me. However, in the Withings Mate app, I had duplicate entries for workouts. Otherwise, the app is really very clear and the hints for sleep evaluation and pulse are very helpful. I do not suffer from sleep apnea, so unfortunately I cannot say anything about the reliability of these measurements. All in all, a very chic watch with the elementary smartwatch functions, plus ECG and O2 measurement and a sensational battery life. This would indeed have been the knockout argument, but I miss the autonomous GPS function on the Withings (which would of course significantly affect the battery) and on the other hand the possibility to answer calls or reply to a message from the watch. Therefore, the watch is more likely to be used by me when I just don't feel like charging the Apple Watch every day and prefer understatement. All in all, I can recommend the watch. Sometimes there is criticism of the not-so-accurate step count and deviations in pulse. However, I could not find this.
March 24, 2022 | anonymous Model Face Pro/Cons I purchased the white face rose gold Steel HR.Compared to my older FitBit it is a million times more reliable in syncing and accuracy.I love it.However, the STEEL as compared to the SCAN is more difficult to read.The digital screen is smaller and more than the SCAN.Also, all the watch faces have a lot of glare from the glass.It is very difficult to see the rose gold hands, which are very thin, against the white face.Also the SCAN model has actual metal tic marks while the STEEL just has very light gray, difficult to see ticks.The black colored model with silver hands in the STEEL is much more readable, but it is just to masculine for me.The size 36 vs. 38, doesn't have a significant impact on the style.I don't think the size makes it look more or less masculine.So, I am keeping the NAVY colored SCAN.Due to the easier to read larger hands, larger brighter screen, and slightly more feminine appearance than the black.
March 23, 2022 | anonymous Withings HR to Scanwatch Loving the product. I had used the HR for over 2 years and then jumped the wagon as soon as this was released, impressed by how much the HR had impressed me. Not much noticeable difference between the except for slightly thicker dual and larger LCD display. Battery life with notifications is about 2-3 weeks. I turned off notifications and take ECG and pulse on an ondemand basis and battery is at 38% after about 25 days of charging.Battery life and the simplistic design are what impressed me the most on this beautiful device. And also the fact that I could use any strap off the market (allergic to silicon straps, so switch to leather strap before before trying the watch).
March 21, 2022 | anonymous Best health watch! I have only had it about a week and because I look at it so much it's at 50% battery. So time will tell but that's already better than other smart watches I've had. The band is a type of silicone but it is so soft that it does not irritate my skin because I'm super sensitive to metals and platics. Love that it sets and keeps the time for you and that it looks like a real classic watch. It is so much lighter and way more comfortable than expected. Super easy to navigate and you can even personalize it buy putting the options in the order you want (through the app). Love the fact that this is more of a health watch not just for those who are looking to get fit. It has those options to start a workout if you want but it has the oxygen levels and the ecg option (if you are over 22 years old and they approve you which is free in the app) which makes it even better. I originally found this for my mom and her heart health but I loved the options and got myself one as well. I really have no complaints at this point and am excited about what this watch can tell me.For those who don't know and want to understand: An electrocardiogram (ECG) is a simple test that can be used to check your heart's rhythm and electrical activity.
March 17, 2022 | anonymous Excellent Hybrid SmartWatch Remarks: I purchased a sports wriststrap from a local shop and it is a perfect fit with ScanWatch.This is the perfect smartwatch for me. Great Battery Life, Great Looking and Design, Great Functionality and minimal notification on my wrist. It is my daily driver right now.If you want a specific smartwatch that never distracts you while you work or focus on your activities. This is the best choice.Also Delivery is much faster than my expectation...Excellent service by AMAZON.
March 16, 2022 | anonymous An amazing watch I wear my watch every day and night. The battery life is amazing. I can highly recommend a Scanwatch. Withings is Nokia, a great name in old cell phones.
March 9, 2022 | anonymous Extensive and accurate measurements on the 3rd attempt, connection between phone and watch established. Automatic update. Since then, oxygen, pulse, and EKG measurements have been used. Measurement results match professional devices. Step counter also works well. Sleep quality measurement also works well. However, lying still in bed and reading is also considered light sleep. Atrial fibrillation automatically detected and recorded. Subsequently, an EKG was taken, printed, and sent as an email - Great watch!!! March 7, 2022 | anonymous Perfect watch Could not activate ECG cos watch is bought from USA and I need a USA phone number to activate the feature. I am not living in USA.
March 7, 2022 | anonymous Great watch I loved this watch, it looks like a nice traditional watch, but has all the digital features that I need. Great! March 5, 2022 | anonymous Misleading claims 1. The battery life is no were near 30 days. With all the functions on you would be lucky to get 7. Not a deal breaker.2. The watch face is the same size in all their watches they just added an 2mm metal band around the scan watch and called it a 40 mm. If they try to fool you with these two features then the question is. What other misleading claims are they making?Otherwise a good watch at a good price.
March 4, 2022 | anonymous Good and looks chic, but The watch and the app work well. Together with my iPhone, the basic functions of the watch work well. I cannot judge whether everything that appears is correct. What is really annoying is that forwarding messages to the watch does not (anymore) work. So, if you depend on it, you should wait before buying. Many people have described these problems in the help forum. Unfortunately, the help functions are not helpful or do not solve the problems. Addendum and correction to 4 stars Suddenly it works with the messages and they arrive well. I hope it stays that way.
February 28, 2022 | anonymous Best Hybrid Smartwatch ever This watch speaks for itself. Anyone who has ever had it will probably not want to miss it anymore. Of all the many hybrid watches, this is the only one that truly deserves the name Hybrid Smartwatch, no annoying apps, all information always immediately accessible. And it is also visually THE eye-catcher and at the same time as inconspicuous as a smartwatch. Thank you very much for this really great product. H.Barth February 25, 2022 | anonymous Top product with good handling for me I bought this product to have a rather inconspicuous monitoring of my vital data. This product fulfills the necessary purposes for me and also looks good. Since I always had to get upset so quickly in the office, I urgently needed a way to warn me of worse things! It warns me quickly when my blood pressure goes up, I can check if I have atrial fibrillation and the device overall calms me down more! Just the fact that I use it doesn't make me get to 100 so quickly anymore. Really recommendable.
February 25, 2022 | anonymous Internet friend This watch is simply great.
February 22, 2022 | anonymous Top Fitness Watch I have owned the Withings Scanwatch since January 26, 2022. I opted for the 42mm version. It arrived quickly and well-packaged, as is typical with Amazon. So everything was perfect. The watch is well-made and feels solid. However, for a watch that costs almost 300 EUR, one should expect a German instruction manual. But even without it, after a short adjustment period, I was able to handle all the functions. The Scanwatch measures 200 steps less than my Fitbit Ionic over a defined distance. But for me, that's accurate enough. The synchronization with the app works quite well for the most part. Occasionally, there are some problems, but that's not a big deal for me. However, one thing is absolutely negative. The advertising claims 30 days of battery life. That may be possible in the lab without use, but not in daily use. With moderate use of the GPS function, I can only get 10 days of battery life. That's more than my Fitbit, but it doesn't match the product announcement. And if a parameter deviates from the specification by two-thirds, that's a defect. That's why I only give it 4 stars. Nevertheless, I can give an absolute recommendation. The Withings Scanwatch is definitely suitable for documenting general fitness levels.
February 20, 2022 | anonymous Difficult Watch would not seem to pair correctly.After nearly an hour, everything is fine.All the functions seem to be working fine.
February 19, 2022 | anonymous Great device I am fully satisfied. The promised features are fulfilled, the battery life is sensational. Clear purchase recommendation.
February 18, 2022 | anonymous Amazing watch.
Great watch, I had read a lot about this watch before I bought it. I love it, fits well, works perfect. The app it’s great. Has some many features available. Battery was very i important to me as I have a iwatch but the battery don’t last much. This watch the battery is almost a month depends on how many notifications you have on.
February 18, 2022 | anonymous ECG does. It work for international buyers International buyers beware.At the time of purchasing this watch the item description did not mention that if you live outside USA you will not be able to use the main function of this watch ECG. I had to return it and buy one from Amazon.co.uk, if you purchase the watch in EU it works anywhere.
February 18, 2022 | anonymous International buyers beware Description fails to mention the ECG function of this watch only works in he USA.Had to return it and buy from Amazon.co.uk, EU one works in any country February 18, 2022 | anonymous perfect minimalist watch w/ pretty accurate step counter I needed a step counter and wanted something more fashionable than the typical products. This thing is rad: the straps are super easy to swap (same level of difficulty as a necklace clasp), the water resistance makes it so I can go into the shower with it, the watch face is beautiful, the screen is tiny yet perfect for checking in on steps, date, heartbeat, etc. The buzzing alarm helps wake me up more gradually and with less rage. Oh and battery really does last forever if you're not doing a breathing check every 15 minutes as you sleep. Takes less than an hour to recharge too. If you're looking for a pretty watch that tracks your steps and general fitness, but isn't another tiny computer screen bugging you with notifications all the time, this is a great option.Only con so far has been that when I binged some videogames the other night, it tracked me as sleeping. But maybe that's just me.
February 16, 2022 | anonymous Good design, but charging problems.
Well made. Repeated charging issues.
February 15, 2022 | anonymous Good for the price.
First of all, it must be said that the watch is not cheap for me at around 300€. However, the functions are good for the price. The pulse detection is mediocre like all optical sensors, but usable, the ECG is entertaining, but not more for me. Activity tracking is very different. When running/walking, the watch is quite accurate with the mobile GPS and coupled with Strava, you have all the data directly in view. Unfortunately, the watch does not count sets or repetitions for 'fitness' and shows HR and calories incorrectly (in the overview at the end, it fits again). Battery life is good, but that is probably due to the small display. Sleep detection is good, but sometimes it counts false breaks with my short ones as 2 interruptions. All in all, the watch is good for the price. It also looks chic. If you really value fitness functions, you should consider a Fenix 6x pro (approx. 500€)/ Fenix 7 pro solar sapphire (approx. 999€), but then you have to dig much deeper into your pocket. Alternatively, I recommend tracking sports with a chest strap (Wahoo) in addition, then the data of a Fenix can easily compete with a much more humane price.
February 14, 2022 | anonymous Had to return I returned it as it was not compatible in Australia February 11, 2022 | anonymous ECG works well Been using it for a few days, set up was simple, the only thing that confused me was the moving of the watch hands to 10:10 am to avoid obstructing the digital dial. Had to read the manual to figure it out.The app works OK, no complaints, but the paper manual does not seem to name it correctly. So far so good! February 9, 2022 | anonymous Great watch, app needs improvement.
The watch is great, but the app needs some improvement. If a patient wants to send the recorded ECG values to the doctor, each measurement must be sent. A larger time period is not transferable. Should be improved urgently.
February 7, 2022 | anonymous First-class functions and still visually a watch This ScanWatch accurately monitors sleep, breathing, step count, and workouts. However, it looks like a chic wristwatch, especially with the interchangeable strap.
February 6, 2022 | anonymous Top product, buying recommendation Top product, buying recommendation February 4, 2022 | anonymous Scan Watch The watch looks quite good and provides interesting information with the app. However, this is not a smartwatch, rather an instrument for monitoring health parameters.
February 4, 2022 | anonymous Not an Apple, but an elegant watch.
It looks like a wristwatch. That's a plus for me. All functions are executed without errors. I don't use many of them (but I've tested them all at least once), so the watch runs for a long time, up to 2 weeks. You can even make it last up to 4 weeks if you mainly use the pedometer. Step count tends to underestimate, the watch sometimes starts counting only after 20 to 100 steps if you've been sitting for a while (I don't see this as a flaw, but as an excuse for sensitivity, and I prefer it to counting too many steps). Funny: it evaluates 'playing drums' as 'swimming' and measures it in steps. So when I'm drumming, I can walk on water. I'm 100% satisfied.
February 2, 2022 | anonymous Battery life is about 10-14 days, not close to what was advertised.
I've used this watch for about 2 months and I've only been able to get 10-14 days of battery life and not the advertised 30 days.I don't have ECH or O2 detection on nor do I use those features.I really hope this can get fixed in a watch update.It is a nice looking watch.
January 31, 2022 | anonymous Flawless and very accurate Great watch, classic design, very accurate measurements.
January 30, 2022 | anonymous Withings Withings January 30, 2022 | anonymous withings scanWatch hybrid The watch is very beautiful and everything works wonderfully so far, the only point to complain about is the charging station, it should be magnetic. When you connect the watch, no one should come too close or make a sudden movement or come to the table, then it becomes critical. For the price and the very good workmanship of the watch, a better charging station could have been developed, such as with the fitbit versa 3 or 2.
January 29, 2022 | anonymous Beautiful Health Watch Very beautiful watch that can retrieve all important things. Super long battery life! January 27, 2022 | anonymous Schlicht, unauffällig und dennoch ganz smart! Smart functions such as heart rate, ECG, breathing and sleep monitoring. Looks like a normal watch and not like all the clone watches! Stylish, highly recommended! January 27, 2022 | anonymous Withings ScanWatch Super smartwatch looks very good to me, the battery lasts at least 3 weeks. What more could you want? Top, again and again.
January 27, 2022 | anonymous Still using it from Steel HR It's great that I only have to charge the battery about once every 20 days. With this, I can track my heart rate, sleep, and sleep oxygen saturation every 30 minutes, receive notifications, and record 30 minutes of activity per day. (Oxygen saturation measurement was not available at the time of sale, but it became available the other day!) I only receive necessary notifications on the watch because if I let all notifications come through, the battery will run out quickly. You can select this in the HealthMate app settings. I also really like that it looks simple and can be worn without hesitation for work or private use. I have replaced the silicone belt that comes with it with a commercially available leather belt because my skin hurts if I wear it for a long time (probably due to lack of oxygen due to close contact). I wear it all the time except in the bath, but my skin doesn't get damaged. It's also great that you can use regular commercially available belts, unlike the Apple Watch. I change the belt to match my outfit by making it an easy click. It's a great era because there are watch belt specialty stores that will process your favorite belt into an easy click. Please refer to the HealthMate app instructions for where to wear the watch and various measurements. The instructions are very helpful and easy to understand. For example, if you follow the video help in the HealthMate app, you can measure oxygen saturation properly. When I measured it without watching the video, strange values ​​came out or an error occurred, but since watching the video, I have had no problems. Tracking exercise such as walking, running, and cycling is automatically done to some extent without doing anything. If you want to display the location information of the moved location on a map or want to get detailed information, you need to specify the activity start from the watch yourself. Please note that you need to carry your smartphone with you when moving to get location information. Sleep tracking is a bit vague, and it may not work well if the front and back are shifted or if the tracking time is short. (Am I moving while I'm sleeping?) I manually correct it when it's strange. You can store data on the Withings official website, but it is also linked to Google Fit, so I have turned on the link.
January 26, 2022 | anonymous Super Watch The watch has the advantage that it only needs to be charged about every 4 weeks. It looks appealing and high-quality. If I want to criticize something, then the placement of the crown is inconvenient. It may happen that a function is accidentally triggered by the movement of the hands because the crown is pressed by the movements. It would be useful to place the crown outside the center or on the other side in the future.
January 24, 2022 | anonymous Almost perfect Almost perfect. It is very high quality. Can do a lot. 1. However, when swimming, other smartwatches can outperform it by indicating which swimming style was used. 2. The interval for heart rate measurement is not adjustable. 3. I also find the app not very smart when combined with Google Fit. I miss both of these features.
January 24, 2022 | anonymous Tolle Scanwatch So far, I'm really impressed. Especially the nighttime monitoring (oxygen, pulse) gives me a good feeling. The battery life is phenomenal, two weeks are not a problem even with very frequent use. The only thing that bothers me is that only three alarms can be set for the vibration alarm. I don't understand the limitation.
January 24, 2022 | anonymous Great looks, detailed reports Continuous monitoring results for pulse rate and sleep depth are linked to time of occurrence so can be linked to activity level and how your body responds to what is happening in your life. Definitely improves understanding of personal health. Multi-level analysis provided by the app. Highly recommended.
January 24, 2022 | anonymous Mixed feelings The watch itself is well done with great design and special features such as EKG and Spo2 measurement. The smartwatch functions for sports and sleep are rather mixed compared to other watches. Pros - Long battery life - Design - EKG - SPO2 Cons - Alarm function only via app and unreliable - Steps displayed too low - Squats increase number of floors - Heart rate inaccurate during the day - Sleep monitoring inaccurate, reading is recorded as sleep, daytime sleep not detected January 23, 2022 | anonymous Fast exactly what I was looking for I wanted an aesthetically pleasing watch with a few smart functions that I can wear every day, which is why I opted for the 38 mm version of the Scanwatch. Specifically, I wanted a notification function (vibration, a small display, and a long battery life). The remaining functions are nice to have but not essential. After two days, the battery is now at 75 percent (although with all possible monitoring functions activated), which would mean about 10 days of battery life. This is already far from the advertised 30 days, which may also refer to the 42 mm version, as it probably has more space for a larger battery. I'm curious to see how this will balance out over time. Unfortunately, there are also a few small points that bother me a little. The first is that the app occasionally hangs up, and I can't make any settings. This can only be fixed by stopping the app in the app manager. Secondly, most versions lack the 10:10 function. The hands are always seen in this position in all photos to allow for the best view of the display. However, it seems that only the 42 mm version in black seems to have this function. Why not simply give the option to activate this function in the app? The third point for me would be the possibility to display the battery level instead of the daily step goal in percentage. So that you don't have to click through the menu or open the app for this information every time. If these minor issues are ever fixed, the watch will receive a full 5 stars from me.
January 23, 2022 | anonymous A watch that does more than just display time The Withings ScanWatch is a sleek precision measuring instrument that motivates movement while monitoring important bodily functions. The display of how much percent of the previously set training goal has already been achieved is particularly good. The watch is of high quality and measures precisely. Setting up the watch via the Health Mate app is self-explanatory. The app is clear and informative. I can highly recommend the ScanWatch.
January 23, 2022 | anonymous Great hybrid watch.
Great product for someone who wants an activity tracker with some smartwatch capabilities in a traditional watch form factor. Battery life is amazing and it is one of the main reasons why I switched from a fossil smartwatch to scanwatch.Only reason I would not give it 5 star is it's price. I think it's $100 more expensive. $200 price tag would have been more appropriate for what it offers.
January 23, 2022 | anonymous Super Smartwatch to monitor body functions The watch fits well on the wrist and does not interfere with sleep. Since everything works smoothly and understandably, one has very good control over their body functions throughout the day. The app is also perfect. It clearly shows the day's performance and EKG and encourages starting fresh with training every day.
January 22, 2022 | anonymous Quite good EKG and SaO2 are working. The dial is sensitive, I deactivated it, but the watch still 'detects' activities that are not happening.
January 21, 2022 | anonymous Tolles Teil I am very satisfied with the watch, the battery life is also wonderful.
January 20, 2022 | anonymous Good looking Health Tracker Some fitness trackers are too plastic with features that you rarely actually use. Scan watch is a Stylish step away from those cookey cutter designs. It tracks exactly what you need with no unnecessary clutter.
January 20, 2022 | anonymous Beautiful design, elegant The watch looks very nice. It doesn't stand out too much. It actually has all the functions you need. Sleep is monitored very well, steps are counted correctly. Workouts are also recognized and recorded. Messages are displayed. Only the calorie consumption doesn't seem to work properly. From 0 o'clock to 5 o'clock I burned 450 calories in my sleep. And on a day with almost no movement, about 2000 calories. I asked the manufacturer, but no response yet.
January 19, 2022 | anonymous Top watch Classy Hybrid Smartwatch. Works perfectly and the accompanying app is great. I would buy the watch again and again.
January 19, 2022 | anonymous Very satisfied so far Been in use for more than 3 days. The watch has a great design and convinces me so far with all its functions. Maybe a bit unusual for thin wrists but by no means too big.
January 18, 2022 | anonymous Elegant and cutting edge.
Love everything about this watch.
January 18, 2022 | anonymous Excellent watch.
Excellent, attactive watch - with smartwatch features. Very satisfied. Battery life is extraordinary for the performace.
January 17, 2022 | anonymous Smart watch that looks like a regular watch Super easy to set up and navigate. Looks like a traditional watch though it does everything and more that fitness trackers do. Displays text messages and incoming calls but doesn’t respond to them. I was concerned about the “prescription” needed to use the ECG function but all it entailed was permitting the first ECG to be reviewed by a doctor. Entailed clicking the approve button and waiting less than 24 hrs January 16, 2022 | anonymous Health tracking watch Beautiful watch for good health tracking January 16, 2022 | anonymous High-quality and "smart" I'm writing my first impression: after the sleep mattress, the scale, and the blood pressure monitor, I also have the watch. All products from Withings are very high-quality, no cheap plastic stuff. And the installation is surprisingly easy. Even the clock sets the time itself after the first update. No manual needed. These products are very reminiscent of a Californian computer manufacturer, you would think they come from the same product line. The integration on the iPhone is also very easy, and all Withings products run on the same app. This gives a nice overview of everything that can be measured. The devices also work without WLAN, but I haven't been able to install and synchronize them without WLAN. By the way, the watch comes with a rubber strap, probably made for sports and swimming. I would recommend the bundle with the nicer leather strap. All functions except continuous oxygen measurement (during sleep) work perfectly. Battery life is significantly longer than with other comparable products. I probably owe a later update on the durability of this watch ;-) January 15, 2022 | anonymous Step count too low Heart monitoring and health data very, very good, e.g. atrial fibrillation is detected well. Sports only moderate. Steps too few, as too large steps are set. Fitness level only works with GPS. Indoor activities do not count January 14, 2022 | anonymous Top Product I am very satisfied with this purchase decision! Fast delivery, everything was okay! I just ordered the Withings Body Cardio scale ???? January 13, 2022 | anonymous Beautiful and elegant watch I bought it for my boyfriend as a Christmas gift and he is simply thrilled, it's perfect for a man. Beautiful watch.
January 13, 2022 | anonymous Fitbit turned Withings!!! Love it! Love the look, love the app, tracks everything I need while looking sophisticated and sleek. The only thing that bothers me is you have to have the app open in the background to get notifications. From what I understand this is a bug and they are currently working on it. I got the small size and have small wrists. I was worried about it looking too big, but its perfect! January 13, 2022 | anonymous Great watch, but...
When I ordered the watch and first unpacked it, I was immediately impressed. The feel of the watch is really extremely high-quality, just like the packaging. I was really very happy with the watch until I felt the vibration motor for the first time. I really don't understand why such a cheap vibration motor is installed in such a high-quality watch. I could easily overlook it if there wasn't this one problem: the motor not only feels bad, but you can also hear it acoustically very strongly. It has often happened that others have addressed me about it, and that is really not the purpose of a vibration motor. In addition, this unfortunately makes the watch look unnecessarily cheap. Since you can't weaken or even turn off the vibrations of the watch, I was so bothered by it that I sent the watch back. This is mainly because, especially for this price, I expected something better in terms of the vibration motor, which is really important for a health watch.
January 11, 2022 | anonymous Best Smart Hybrid Watch I upgraded from the Steel HR Sport watch to the ScanWatch and have never regretted it. There is no other hybrid watch like it out there. The ECG and SpO2 sensors are clinically validated. The fit tracking functions carried over from the Steel HR watches are very good. The mobile app is also superb.
January 11, 2022 | anonymous Does what it's supposed to do Works perfectly. Very satisfied.
January 10, 2022 | anonymous Several features everything works ok, i am satisfied. Great quality January 10, 2022 | anonymous Excellent measurement results for ECG and saturation.
Touchscreen is not required! The variety and accuracy of the measurements and the reliable data transfer to the Android app are positive. Registering the smartwatches via Bluetooth requires some practice.
January 10, 2022 | anonymous Super watch, everything works exactly as described.
If you are looking for a watch with a classic design that also has intelligent functions, then this product is the best choice. It convinced me. But be careful, it does not replace a smartwatch. However, if you don't have to choose a different look for your watch every day and can live with the fact that the GPS signal is needed from the mobile phone to track the activity, I can only recommend the watch.
January 9, 2022 | anonymous Well-designed hybrid watch with many useful features.
The Withings Hybridwatch has a very nice design. If the glass were flatter and anti-reflective (like the legendary Braun watches or the Knauermann Smartwatch, for example), it would be perfect. The size and weight (42mm watch) are okay. The standard strap is also okay - soft and comfortable to wear. Setting up is relatively quick, but the app seemed a bit confusing at first. Unfortunately, you are forced to sign up with Withings, which may not be to everyone's liking. The watch is easy to operate with the crown. The slightly longer (rotary) path to change functions is not bad at all, in my opinion. This avoids malfunctions. I mainly use the watch to measure and monitor vital functions (oxygen saturation, ECG, heart rhythm) and to monitor sleep. This works really well. Other functions such as pedometer, etc. can also be found on cheaper trackers. However, here you have only one watch for everything on your wrist. By the way, the display at the bottom does not show the seconds, as with many watches (there is no second hand), but rather how far the given fitness activity has been reached. The pedometer should perhaps be calibrated with the individual step length for a more accurate kilometer reading. (However, this does not make much difference.) The measurements seem to be quite accurate overall. Especially the sleep monitoring works excellently for me. The exact sleep time is correct as well as the waking phases. The (1-channel) ECG also seems to work quite well. The results are, of course, not 100% valid in every case due to measurement technology. The associated Health Mate app is, in my opinion, a bit overloaded with a lot of information and advertising. Less would be more there. Overall, a very nice and practical wristwatch with many helpful functions, a beautiful design, and clever ideas. For example, the hands automatically adjust when the display is activated to provide a clear view. In addition, when you lift your arm, the display also shows the time and date with the day of the week digitally. The battery lasts - of course, depending on usage - for a very long time. I can really recommend the watch so far (about 1 week).
January 9, 2022 | anonymous Something different than just iWatch A health tracker that is also stylistically convincing and not immediately recognizable as such. Looks elegant and can be worn to official occasions because everyone thinks it is a high-quality wristwatch. The app is also great. I was particularly impressed by the battery's stability, which only needs to be charged once every 2-3 weeks.
January 9, 2022 | anonymous Hybrid Watch Elegant and in my opinion the best hybrid watch, previously had one from Fo... Bluetooth is stable but has no great range January 7, 2022 | anonymous Works very well and easy set up Not sure why others have had difficulties. For me, all functions have worked well and set up was easy, if you actually read the directions and follow the steps. I have many premature contractions so I wanted this to capture a simple EKG of the events. You have to manually initiate an EKG. It won't monitor you continuously (there is some built in automaticity but cannot do a 24 constant surveillance). It has a feature built in to send a someone a pdf of the 30 second EKG strip which is helpful. Overall, very happy with the product.
January 7, 2022 | anonymous Lives up to as advertise. Very satisfied.
Like the notifiecations and ecg app works for me. Very satisfied ! January 5, 2022 | anonymous Best low key smartwatch Writings Scanwatch is the next step from the previous Steel HR. In addition to the regular features of the Steel HR sO2 readings and a breath assist, sleep tracking, and a few more. Love that the watch crystal is a full curved synthetic sapphire. Battery life is excellent as stated.
January 5, 2022 | anonymous Completely satisfied even after more than a year Even after more than a year, I am still completely satisfied! I use it daily, but not for any notifications, only for recording data and for the time. In my opinion, it looks elegant, the battery actually lasts for several weeks, and the data seems to be recorded well - I would buy it again.
January 4, 2022 | anonymous Beautiful Watch The watch has a high-quality feel. The functions are top-notch, which is why I bought the watch. If you suffer from breathing pauses during sleep, you can monitor it with the watch. The battery life is unbeatable. So far, everything is great.
January 4, 2022 | anonymous Perfect Everything runs as promised.
January 4, 2022 | anonymous Does what it promises Does what it promises. Clear purchase recommendation January 1, 2022 | anonymous Almost perfect First the watch is very attractive and the battery life of two weeks for the way I had the watch setup is excellent.Sleep tracking is really poor, it randomly missed sleep tracking at least two nights a week.It does not seem that Whitings responds to, or fixes issues reported on their support web forum pages.In the end I returned the watch as its accuracy did not live up to expectations.If the bugs get worked out, I will happily give the watch another try, but some of the issues have been unfixed since the watch was released in Europe well over a year ago.
January 1, 2022 | anonymous Long Battery, Extensive Physio Monitoring I have been following Withings and have several earlier watches. This is definitely the best so far. What is distinctive: 30 day battery life, ECG and HR, excellent sleep tracking, attractive hybrid watch design. Build quality is excellent with stainless steel case. I recommend using the included elastic band to ensure good skin contact for HR. The 42 mm watch is rather large for small wrists.
January 1, 2022 | anonymous Very Impressed I'm very impressed with the ScanWatch. It does the things I need, is easy to use and looks like a really nice watch (I like analog watches). Highly recommend.
January 1, 2022 | anonymous When buying it in Canada There is a list in the Withings website with the available features for each country. In Canada:Oxygen Saturation (recreational-grade SpO2)Respiratory Scan (incl. SpO2)Notifications: Irregular HeartbeatECG is not available in Canada yet (Dec 2021). If the oxygen saturation is not so important to you I’d get the steel hr version, which is about half the price of the scan watch.
December 31, 2021 | anonymous Great product The black 42mm model looks entirely normal, like any other analog watch.I vastly prefer it to an Apple Watch.The battery life is insanely long and it only takes an hour or so to charge.The added features were easy to set up and overall it works perfectly.Not sure how accurate the medical tests are; no way to know.At any rate, I’m so glad I ditched an expensive mechanical watch for this thing … it is not going to pass muster with watch snobs but still … it’s a real bullseye of a product.They got this one right.
December 30, 2021 | anonymous Super nice, simply explained watch I actually liked everything, even though the battery life was over after 18 days, after the first charge, maybe it will last longer after several charges? But that's already amazing, no known watch can do that and I also tried everything every day! Just super December 28, 2021 | anonymous Withings Scan Watch Hybrid Smartwatch with ECG, heart rate sensor and...
I particularly like that the watch has a long battery life. The chosen rubber strap could be softer. It is worth mentioning the scratch-resistant sapphire glass, which has already withstood some impacts without scratches. Technically easy to use.
December 28, 2021 | anonymous I'm thrilled with this watch!! I received the watch as a gift and I'm thrilled. It not only looks great, but also fulfills its purpose perfectly. The bracelet is very pleasantly soft. The watch looks filigree, but is slightly higher than conventional watches, but somewhere 'the technology' has to be accommodated. At first glance, it looks like an ordinary watch with a dial. The various tracking programs can be conveniently selected via the wheel. The synchronization with the mobile app has so far worked quickly and without complaint. The evaluations are presented very clearly and if you want to learn more, you can retrieve additional information. I'm thrilled with the ECG function! I can recommend the watch without reservation. I used to have other brands, but none fulfilled their purpose so reliably and smoothly. I'm really thrilled!! December 27, 2021 | anonymous All good As described December 27, 2021 | anonymous Absolutely stellar watch but battery life is meh for a hybrid Withings wearer for almost two years here. Have had the Scanwatch for a couple months and had the Steel HR before that.First off, if you're reading the reviews you should definitely buy either this watch or the Steel HR. I absolutely love it. It's gorgeous, the app is great, it fits in well to daily life. Looks fantastic whether suited up or wearing grubbies to work on the car. My doctor even hooked up tri-leads to me to compare the ECG with actual medical equipment and they thought it was pretty darn close! Same with O2 sat monitor and heart rate. Quality wise, on par with its excellent forerunner, the Steel HR. The functional twisting crown with haptic feedback is a nicer touch than the push button on the old one.I have to ding it on one star because of the battery life and charge time compared to the prior model. My Steel HR lasted for about a month with all features enabled and charged almost completely in the time it took to take a shower. This one lasts about five days with all features enabled (I know, there are more features). But the bigger problem is charge time. I take the watch off for showers and that's a logical time to charge (obviously you want to wear this in your sleep). About 30 minutes does not come anywhere near to fully charging the battery. Just now it only went from 30-40%. So you need to find time to charge it during the day or occasionally not wear it while sleeping. I think I'm going to disable some of the continuous monitoring features which puts me back at my Steel HR just with sleep disturbance monitoring and O2 sat on demand.Ultimately, if you want activity tracking, heart rate monitoring, enhanced sleep monitoring, ECG and O2 sat WHILE still wearing an attractive watch, this is hard to beat. If you don't care about ECG, O2 and sleep disturbance tracking the Steel HR is the watch to get as it's more or less the same just without those features and is cheaper. As to whether the ScanWatch is with the extra money over the Steel HR, I think that depends on how much you prioritize those extra features and battery life. If this would last a week plus on a charge I'd say the extra hundred bucks is a no brainer. But battery life as it is... tougher call.One other note. While this watch will give you notifications, they're a bit cumbersome on the small screen. I have it turned off.
December 27, 2021 | anonymous Withings Scanwatch Happy with the purchase. Main reason to buy is because of ECG function. But if you are Malaysian, you have to apply personal AP permit as this watch will be hold by customer. Sadly there is no ECG functy available for Malaysia market too, hope this function can be available Malaysia soon.
December 25, 2021 | anonymous Nice looking but still has a ways to go First of watch looks fantastic and o2 sensor and ekg are really cool. But I can’t recommend it, workouts constantly get paused, seems inconsistent on a lot of the stats. Very comfy though and like I said looks nice I’m keeping it to add to the collection and will edit after a month or so of more use December 25, 2021 | anonymous Not visible at night My favorite is the battery life.
December 23, 2021 | anonymous Beautiful watch with great features As far as I can judge after one month, all functions are running smoothly. In addition, the watch looks great. The description is 'only' in English, but you can easily get along with the app, especially since the operation is simple.
December 21, 2021 | anonymous Super hybrid Smartwatch The analog design of the watch is great, especially in combination with the leather strap. And the smart functions such as step counter, pulse, oxygen etc. work very reliably. The workout detection is moderate in my opinion, I had a Samsung Galaxy Gear S3 before, where it worked a bit better. But I wouldn't go back. The only thing that I really miss here is Spotify. But I knew that beforehand, so no deduction. PS The battery life is insane, it deserves an extra star.
December 19, 2021 | anonymous Super Watch Everything works perfectly and there's nothing to complain about. I've had many smartwatches and fitness watches, but this hybrid is the best for me. It can do everything I need and the battery lasts 20 days. Top.
December 19, 2021 | anonymous An excellent wearable fitness device for anyone with AFIB I’d been considering an Apple Watch for fitness and heart functions when I came across this. This met my needs for a fitness and heart monitoring device primarily, but it’s also a comfortable and stylish watch that I’m happy to wear everyday. It takes a bit of patience and persistence to set up and in my case I had to delete and reinstall the iPhone app to clear a network connection error related to the ECG setup. That aside, the latest app-driven setup routine was thorough and easy to follow.The only reason for my not giving this a 5-star rating was the inability to adjust the heart rate zones via the app, so that recorded workouts provide a better indication of actual effort verses a standard age-driven calculation. That said, a work around is to adjust the birth year in your profile (while referencing a workout) to move the HR zones up or down.Notifications can be set to trigger for specific phone functions such as calls, texts, reminders, etc and the rolling text and vibration alerts are just enough in my opinion as a phone companion device. I have mild AFIB, so for me the auto-alert for abnormal heart rate and the ECG function are the most important features of this device and work perfectly. In fact, they’re much easier to access than on my partner’s Gen-7 Apple Watch. I also love they it holds a charge for a full week, even with my heavy display use. Overall, a great product and easily worth the initial setup effort.
December 19, 2021 | anonymous Excellent as a medical scan watch Very easy to use and set up, Bluetooth connection holds even over up to 10 meters through walls, and the connection is immediately re-established when approaching. My cardiologist is also impressed with the accuracy of the medical parameters. Everything is top-notch December 18, 2021 | anonymous Good heart monitoring Heart function monitoring is great, simple but beautiful design. Many other functions are easy and quick to access. Will want to give another as a gift.
December 17, 2021 | anonymous Great value for money. And very elegant...
I was looking for a watch with ECG function. The watch with the app can really do it super. You can save the ECG as a PDF and/or print, send, etc. The app is clear and has many good features. The watch itself is very elegant. Looks like a 'normal' watch. Especially worth mentioning is the battery life. I received the watch with about 70% charge. I've been using it for 1 week now, and of course, you play a lot with it in the first few days. Nevertheless, I haven't had to charge the watch yet and still have 30% battery left. I definitely recommend it! December 17, 2021 | anonymous Nice alternative to the usual smartwatches Back to the roots and yet up to date. I deliberately chose the Withings because I was tired of constantly charging it (every two days). The watch looks chic with hidden qualities such as: SpO2 sensor, heart rate monitor, sleep monitoring, ECG, etc... 'The ScanWatch is the world's first hybrid smartwatch that can alert its user to a possible case of atrial fibrillation or sleep apnea.' All sensors work to my complete satisfaction so far. The values are conclusive. The missing GPS can be tolerated - with a connection to the smartphone, the route recordings should work. The Withing app (Health) works well and is clear enough for me (iPhone 12 with iOS 15.2) December 16, 2021 | anonymous No flight mode! Otherwise very good.
No way for deactivating the Bluetooth. Quite a disappointment for such a basic function. Otherwise the watch is very beautiful and functional.
December 16, 2021 | anonymous Absolutely Top The device does what it promises. The setup with the app was very clearly explained and worked right away. All functions are logically explained in the app. The tips and hints in the app are also very informative. Since I have been treated several times for atrial fibrillation, the watch gives me security. Even my doctor was amazed at the quality of the ECG recording. So from me a clear recommendation for this product.
December 16, 2021 | anonymous Just right for health-conscious people Recording of sleep tracking and training has become more comfortable.
December 14, 2021 | anonymous The watch is great! It is very simple and you don't immediately recognize that it is a fitness watch, which was one of my purchase criteria. The ECG and oxygen measurement were also very important points that convinced me to buy it. The handling and setup is relatively easy and of very good quality, and it can be worn very comfortably, even at night. The results seem to be accurate, which certainly won't always please everyone. I can only recommend this watch.
December 11, 2021 | anonymous Good purchase The watch looked good in the picture, descriptions and reviews. The first one didn't charge the battery and was returned. The replacement came promptly, looks really valuable and works great. The battery lasts a long time, after a week it's still at 75% charge. Operating the watch through the crown is simple, and the evaluation through the app is also easy. It was a good decision to buy this watch.
December 11, 2021 | anonymous Super Smartwatch First of all: I had a Fossil Founder before and a Fitbit Charge 2 for fitness tracking. I decided against the successor model from Fossil because the battery life is extremely short and I had very bad experiences with Fossil's service. 5 weeks after sending in the defective watch and paying the costs, I was informed that the repair could not be carried out due to missing spare parts. As compensation for my inconvenience, I was supposed to receive a 30% discount on a product. This offer was then suddenly withdrawn. With Fitbit, I don't like that a monthly subscription is necessary for important evaluations. It's different with the Scanwatch. The evaluations are very good. The display is sufficient for operation and displaying messages from the mobile phone. The look is elegant. I have been using the watch with all sensors for 10 days now. The battery still has 30%. I am very satisfied.
December 10, 2021 | anonymous Still getting to know this devices quirks, but I like it very well so far.
Still getting to know the ins and outs of this, but I do like it very well. Def satisfied with my purchase.
December 9, 2021 | anonymous Withings Scan Watch Hybrid Very nice design and top functionality! December 6, 2021 | anonymous Beautiful Watch The watch functions are quite good and the battery lasts quite long! However, the app shows sleep differently, for example, instead of REM, it only shows deep sleep. What is displayed more divided in the Garmin app is not so important! Otherwise, the watch looks like a normal watch, which is nice! December 6, 2021 | anonymous High hopes but fails I was really excited about this product. Perfect combination of design, size and all the of the activity tracking features you need without all the ones you don't.BUT there is a critical design flaw that makes it essentially unusable as a watch. The glass is extremely reflective, more so than I have seen on any other watch. It makes it nearly impossible to read the analog watch. Can't believe such a great design failed on such a minor but critical element.Don't buy if you want to be able to see the time. So close but so far.
December 6, 2021 | anonymous A great product but some improvements required I have been using the Withings watches for years and the experience is amazing. I decided to buy this model because the design and functions are great. The best thing about this hybrid watch is the long battery life, waterproof, and style. The mobile app is great and the watch design is sleek. However, there are some improvements which will cut to 5 stars. - The what's app calls don't ring on the watch. - The watch still notifies when an outgoing call is made. - The watch vibrates when a call is connected. These can be fixed with simple software updates. But overall, I would really recommend the product.
December 5, 2021 | anonymous Exactly what I was looking for I have been using smartwatches from many reputable manufacturers for a long time. What convinced me here was the super clear app, the great feel and quality of this hybrid smartwatch. Unobtrusive like a watch, it offers everything I wanted, oxygen saturation and ECG is an important feature for me. Just like the normal 20mm interchangeable straps can be used. I would buy it again now.
December 4, 2021 | anonymous Very nice watch with many important and good functions The design is great, the band fits securely and is by no means uncomfortable. The functions are crucial for me to monitor my cardiovascular functions. In the app, you can add many other data such as blood pressure values that you have measured (with a separate measuring device) to have a holistic overview. Data can be sent to the family doctor via the app. Furthermore, you can record workouts, just like with a smartwatch. There are fewer types of workouts, but that is not important to me. As a miscellaneous feature, you can record everything that is not predefined.
December 4, 2021 | anonymous Impressive It is remarkable what such a 'watch' can do, especially regarding sleep monitoring, with precise detection of different sleep depths and interruptions. Other health parameters are also well recognized. Only the ECG recording can be somewhat difficult on some arms.
December 4, 2021 | anonymous Perfect for monitoring health.
It's already the 2nd watch (for him and for her). Both work perfectly. The connection with the app is very easy and stable. Great watch.
December 3, 2021 | anonymous Great fitness watch that delivers what it promises I bought the HR Steel 4 years ago and was very satisfied. Since I suffer from heart rhythm disorders, I have now bought this Scan Watch and find it great. Everything works perfectly. The evaluation via the app is easy. I can only recommend this watch.
December 3, 2021 | anonymous Worthwhile...
Great for monitoring vital functions, Health Mate app is great, occasional inaccuracies in GPS tracking during jogging compared to Apple Watch, step counting sometimes not traceable.
December 2, 2021 | anonymous Good smartwatch for health monitoring - which is still a real watch and has little frills Since I had arrhythmia since a flu as a child, which (so far at least) has not been a problem. After my father also had breathing pauses at night and I am now in my early 40s, I decided to get a smartwatch for health monitoring. It was this one because I wanted 1. a not too expensive watch that 2. doesn't look too bulky (and fits my ladies' wrist) and 3. is mainly just a watch. In addition, this watch has received a recommendation from cardiologists because it can detect atrial fibrillation well and the EKGs are considered reliable. Well, what can this watch do? Not as much as other smartwatches, but still quite a bit. EKG, oxygen saturation, pulse measurement, sleep monitoring and pedometer (with kilometers and floors) all work very well. Although I have already 'walked' a kilometer while petting my dogs. But all pedometers in watches have this problem. The watch can also remind you of messages/notifications on your phone and also displays the text in the small window above. I don't really need that, but it's not bad either. Overall, I am very satisfied with the watch - but of course it depends on what you want. For me, the watch should be a watch (which it is and can also 'live' without a phone) and reliably monitor my EKG and breathing and sleep at night. That works well. The app is also quite intuitive, so I have nothing to complain about. So I come to 5 stars because the watch is exactly right for me. But if you are looking for a more functional smartwatch, you should take another watch.
December 2, 2021 | anonymous Nice piece, but...
The watch itself is beautiful. Simple, elegant and timeless - a real eye-catcher. I wanted to switch from an Apple Watch to this device. Reason: I have to charge the Apple Watch every night. After almost two years, the battery life is decreasing more and more. It would be great if there was a smartwatch that had both a long battery life and a (easily) replaceable battery. Since I couldn't find this, I chose this watch.+ Long battery life (relying on other reviewers)+ Chic design+ Great form factor (in my case the 38mm version)+ At first glance a normal watch+ ECG, oxygen and sleep measurement+ Notifications (not really barrier-free readable on the small display, but still a subtle hint that something is happening on the phone)Why is it going back?- Crown & menu control- Hands (depending on the light source) difficult to readThe crown is the crux, I bought a defective device during Black Friday. This was a warehouse deal and therefore a return. This defect was not mentioned in the item description, the device itself was flawless. I don't think Amazon can check every device thoroughly. Anything can happen. It is difficult to turn, as if you always had to overcome a resistance. If you reach the corresponding menu item, but are currently in this area of resistance, the crown can no longer be clicked.After searching through the reviews here, it seems that the crown is the Achilles heel of this gem and has caused problems for many buyers. Other models of Withings have also had various problems. Stiff to worn out - everything is represented.A decoupling of the crown and an adjacent button would change the design, and the simplicity would be lost. However, this delicate and vulnerable weak point could perhaps be eliminated.
November 30, 2021 | anonymous Very satisfied so far I have been using the scanwatch 42mm for a week now. The setup is super easy and worked right away. The watch is very comfortable to wear and with a diameter of 42mm and my wrist circumference of 185mm, it is the ideal size. I previously had the Fitbit Sense, but I was very dissatisfied with the measurements (see my review). Health functions such as ECG, pulse, blood oxygen and sleep monitoring are important to me. I have been using the scanwatch for a week with all the options available, including permanent sleep monitoring, which probably drains the battery the most. After 3 days and nights, the battery was down from 100% to 45%, about 30-40 minutes of charging and the battery was back to 100%, which is okay for me. The 30-day battery life will probably only be achieved with deactivated functions, especially sleep monitoring. I compared the pulse measurement with chest strap values for a whole day and I am very satisfied with the accuracy of the scanwatch (values up to about 120bpm). The app is particularly great, the values are documented clearly with the option to generate a PDF. ECG and blood oxygen seem plausible to me. (My doctor will see the ECG). Sleep monitoring with breathing control also seems plausible to me, the measured values are informative. The included black bracelet is a bit meager, but there are also good alternatives from Whitings. All in all, I am very satisfied until today. If you are looking for a hybrid smartwatch with a focus on health, this is the right choice. A clear recommendation from me until today.
November 29, 2021 | anonymous Prompt and fast delivery. The Scanwatch is highly recommended. Great class.
Unfortunately, the Scanwatch does not have its own GPS. But otherwise, I have taken all health measurements with good results.
November 29, 2021 | anonymous Stylish high-quality watch with long battery life I really like the design and the operation is also well solved. I got the 38mm version with my narrow wrists and compared to the 38mm AppleWatch, it looks much bulkier. (see photo) I only briefly tested the health functions, but they seem to work well and are well explained with small videos. Unfortunately, I had to return it directly because the vibration alarm is too weak for me. Even with a tight bracelet, I hardly notice anything. Maybe this is also a general problem with hybrid watches, as they are much more massive and therefore probably remain unimpressed by the tiny vibration motors ;) Since there is also no indication of missed calls, etc., I will unfortunately have to stick with my AW.
November 29, 2021 | anonymous Sharper! Since it has been 4 years since I started using the 40mm Steel HR, which can measure blood oxygen saturation, I purchased this 42mm product. As you can see, the appearance is the only difference. The operation has also evolved, for example, when there is a notification, the hands move and it is easier to check the content, and you can feel the evolution. What surprised me was that the app can coexist because the models are different, and the data seems to be displayed as a total, even if I tried to use them differently, it was okay. I bought it immediately because it was discounted on Black Friday. This is the fourth Withings product, including my wife's, so I gave it ☆☆☆☆☆ including my expectations.
November 29, 2021 | anonymous Great Watch Has everything a watch needs and more. Sapphire glass, waterproof, comfortable strap. Digital display. Even shows when someone rings the doorbell (assuming Ring doorbell). WhatsApp messages, etc.
November 28, 2021 | anonymous puls unfortunately, there is no app for Windows and I cannot connect the app with the fitbit app.
November 28, 2021 | anonymous Works as promised, long battery live, decent and cool design Delivers measurement data as promised. Easy handling in the smartphone app. good battery live (one week). is used all the time for health monitoring November 28, 2021 | anonymous Reliable measurement in a chic design After much hesitation, I have now decided to go for a ScanWatch. I have not regretted the purchase. The watch does not look like a "normal" smartwatch at all. For me, the information about sleep was important. Here, the watch does an excellent job and I can now provide information about the events during sleep and also about the quality of sleep (deep or light). The other information provided by the watch is interesting for me on the side. The step count proves that you even move around during housework. And you are somehow motivated to reach the self-selectable step goal. Only the measurement of climbed floors is weak. Or the manufacturer does not believe that you climb stairs as often as is necessary without an elevator if you live on an upper floor. The experiments with the Smart Wake-Up function are still waiting for their success. I am still awake before or just in a persistent deep sleep phase. The red light that signals the entrance of notifications on the mobile phone (accidentally set) and the oxygen measurement is disturbing during the night. As a sleep apnea patient, I would like to know occasionally how the situation with the APAP device is working. All data is clearly displayed in the corresponding app. Unfortunately, the health report cannot be customized individually. You only get statistical summaries that are not really meaningful for individual questions. Conclusion: Based on the data provided by the watch, I am convinced of the usefulness of the purchase. The watch (I had chosen the 38mm model) is very comfortable to wear and the design deceives a normal watch. With some skill, you can also change the appearance by changing the bracelet.
November 27, 2021 | anonymous Cool tech, terrible bands So far I like the watch. Disappointing that there is no actual clockwork - the hands are digitally controlled. Makes sense, but disappointing that it's just a digital watch with hands. Also disappointing that you're supposed to NOT wear it on the inside of your wrist, the only way I can comfortably wear it. So far it only seems to cause problems with blood oxygen readings, but I have to assume some of the tracking may be inaccurate when I wear it the way I want it. When I wear it at night for sleep tracking, I wear it 'correctly' and then turn it back around for the day so it's comfortable. Just something to keep in mind if you are a face-on-the-inside watch wearer. The biggest disappointment is the bands. They claim to have a 'quick release' mechanism but that mechanism is absolutely terrible. I bought 2 other bands to switch them and they're just too difficult to switch out so they are essentially wasted money. This is definitely a wheel that did NOT need reinventing. Next time please just use the same normal watch bands we've used forever - they suck a lot less.
November 27, 2021 | anonymous Recommendable Like every Withings product, the watch is of great quality. The app is intuitive and easy to use. Battery life of 30 days is only achievable if you don't really use any of the watch's functions. With 'normal' use (checking EKG and SPO2 twice a day), 14 days are realistic. If you really use all functions daily (breathing monitoring + SPO2 monitoring during sleep every day), you have to recharge after 3 days. However, Withings points out that checking sleep breathing daily consumes a lot of battery. Overall, I find the watch successful and perfect for my purposes.
November 25, 2021 | anonymous Oxygen sensor inconsistent and inaccurate I received the ScanWatch today. I charged the watch to 100%. I went thru the tutorial after pairing it to my phone.I also have an Innovo Oximeter and wanted to compare results.The watch read the following results: 3:14pm 90%; 3:19pm 92%; 3:23pm 97%.My Oximeter read 93 - 95% during the 9 minutes spent taking the 3 measurements. I'm questioning the ScanWatch results.I'm not a fan of the watch band which is a pain to use. I am replacing it.I will update my post after spending a few days with it.
November 24, 2021 | anonymous Withing schwarz 38 mm I am very satisfied so far. Everything works very well. Looks classy. Absolutely not like a smartwatch.
November 22, 2021 | anonymous Super Article Easy to use. Clear app.
November 22, 2021 | anonymous Oximeter separate day/night measurement functional improvements compared to previous model Although I already own the previous model, I decided to buy the new Scan Watch because of the above new functions. Of course, there are several improvements in detail. However, this is topped by the automatic night measurement of preset measurement parameters, whereby (after inquiry) the oximeter averages can also be displayed separately for day and night the next morning. Based on this, changing data (e.g. decreasing oxygen saturation of the outside air) sensitizes me in good time, for example, in case of poor ventilation or incorrect sleeping behavior, and I can react accordingly (e.g. temporarily switch to outside forced ventilation) or I am alerted in good time to decreasing body functions (e.g. lungs). In times of CORONA and increasing calm wind values, this can quickly become important information not only for older people like me. After I had to realize that my blood oxygen saturation in the bedroom had already dropped from 97% to about 82% after about 90 minutes of sleep, I switched to watch-controlled outside forced ventilation with surprisingly positive results!!! So I feel much better!!! (Addition: My place of residence is in the south of Germany. There is predominantly south wind or calm wind periods of up to 75%) November 21, 2021 | anonymous Top Smartwatch For the price, a top smartwatch :-) November 20, 2021 | anonymous Nice looking health monitor.
This watch actually looks better in person to me than the pictures. I opted for the black model. It came in a nice wool case with charger. I am 5'9, 160lbs and the 42mm looks very nice on my wrist. Notifications are easy to read on the screen, and you can stop them as they are scrolling by turning the crown and read them at your own pace. However, there's no going back to them, replying, or calling with the watch which is fine with me, as I got it purely for the ability to monitor for atrial fibrillation and take medical grade ecg. The other health-minding features are nice as well, such as the sleep cycle and respiratory disturbance monitoring, spot O2, and workout recording. It syncs with several fitness apps also. The included band is soft and comfortable, I wear the watch day and night, except for in the shower or hot tub. I have gone a week without charging, and have 50% battery left. It would have gone longer if I could've resisted playing with it so much at first.Now for the cons. The app seems to disconnect with the watch quite frequently, especially if I get more than 10-15 feet away, or don't have the app up on screen for awhile. I leave the Health Mate app running in the background continuously to get notifications. Also, the band, while comfortable, is a bit harder to don one-handed than it should be. Part of this is due to how soft and flexible it is. I will be getting several replacement bands to switch out at my leisure. If they could improve the connection of the watch with the smartphone, especially to receive notifications without the app running, and/or improve app-watch connectivity, this would be a 6-star product! November 19, 2021 | anonymous No sports watch Great looking high-quality watch for everyday use. Unfortunately, due to its weight (stainless steel) and limited functionality, the watch is not suitable for sports. The pedometer had a deviation of about 20-25% for me. (Comparison with mobile phone and Polar sports watch). Heart rate is tracked fairly well. But it may also be due to the fact that due to the weight, the watch never fits well on the wrist and also slips slightly during movement. Despite this, I still recommend the watch for the price! Just not as a sports/fitness watch.
November 18, 2021 | anonymous Awesome watch A very good quality watch including mobile app.
November 18, 2021 | anonymous Very useful and chic The watch is stylish, easy to use and functionally flawless November 17, 2021 | anonymous Finally a stylish cardio watch The watch offers few smartwatch functions (apps, etc.), but many fitness functions. Good step recognition. The sleep recognition is also great. In addition, it has real hands and only a small display. This makes it more sporty/elegant than hi-tech style.
November 17, 2021 | anonymous Works perfectly - lasts 10 days continuously with all functions I only had to restart the watch once initially. Since then, it has been running continuously with high reliability. I am curious to see how well the battery will hold up after a few months. The synchronization with iPhone also works perfectly! November 17, 2021 | anonymous very nice watch unfortunately, the strap of this women's watch, lug width 18 mm, is too short for me, so I had to return it as there are no longer straps available. I ordered the men's watch, lug width 20 mm, where the strap is longer and fits.
November 16, 2021 | anonymous This watch has a missing feature that was approved by FDA, no ECG & Oximeter.
I received yesterday this watch but I plan to return this scanwatch because of a missing feature such as no ECG and oximeter.I will try this coming weekend to call the Withings support services why my watch has a missing ECG and oximeter features? I hope they delivered me the right scanwatch that was for USA use? The weekend is only my free time to call them.
November 16, 2021 | anonymous Withings Scanwatch 42mm Black The watch looks sporty and elegant. I quickly and easily set up the smartwatch with the 'Health Mate' app. It runs without any problems. I can recommend it with a clear conscience.
November 14, 2021 | anonymous No ECG if heart rate is higher than 100 BPM I was disappointed to find out (after using the watch for a few days since its official launch in the US - I bought it on day one) that Scan Watch is not capable of capturing an ECG if the heart rate is below 50 BPM or above 100 BPM. The reason why I purchase it was to be able to capture an ECG while under moderate physical stress , walking 3-5 miles for example. Other than that, the watch is elegant and a great piece of technology. If you are used to a full LCD screen smartwatch it takes just a couple of days to get used to a watch with analog hands and a smaller display, but the combination of small display with cell phone app is very good and efficient. My case is very specific hence my disappointment with the lack of ECG readings above a certain heart rate.
November 14, 2021 | anonymous SpO2 can now be used in Japan too.
Replacement from the previous model SteelHR. Is the addition of SpO2 and ECG functional? However, ECG is still not available in Japan. SpO2 is functionally available, but support may be required to use it or a factory reset may be necessary. The battery may drain faster than SteelHR due to the increased functionality. By the way, there is no condensation inside the windshield, so please be assured.
November 14, 2021 | anonymous Withings Scan Watch The watch was delivered quickly and without any issues. The first measurements are okay. I can't use the watch completely yet because I'm missing the user instructions in German. How can I get them in German? November 13, 2021 | anonymous Reliable and Top Battery I found the Scanwatch as a 'replacement' for my Samsung Gear S3. After 3 years, the short battery life of max. 2 days and the view of a 'black hole' annoyed me. Pros: I like chic watches and the Scanwatch passes as a real watch. The pedometer is very accurate, better than the Gear. The sleep analysis is top-notch. Operation of timer, alarm clock, stopwatch, workout, quick look (display when turning the arm) via the watch is quite easy. Automatic workout detection works well, for me so far cycling, hiking/walking, swimming. Connected GPS works perfectly when starting manual workouts. The battery life is really great. I have had the watch for 6 weeks now. Runtime 3 weeks without quick look and permanent VHF detection but many notifications, alarm clocks, some workouts. With permanent VHF check, just under 2 weeks. Nighttime breathing scan costs around 10% extra, I only did it once. Pulse meter works continuously, my Gear often had problems during workouts. I do ECG and oxygen content about once a week and it gives me a good feeling. The accompanying app is ok and not overloaded. The display of incoming calls, SMS, WhatsApp, etc. (can be selected) works quite reliably, up to a maximum of one floor. Automatic (re)connection between the watch and my Galaxy S10 works 100%. Cons, or what I wish for: A second hand would improve the watch feeling even more - unfortunately not possible via update ;-) . No automatic start/stop function when manually starting the workout. If you let the workout start automatically, it also stops automatically. Unfortunately, two measurements with a break in between cannot be combined into one workout in the app. So it works! Why not when starting manually? No lap counter in the swimming pool, then I can just take the stopwatch. There must be a sensor that could detect this. The barometric altimeter shows the floors but not the current real altitude. I miss this extremely when hiking in the mountains. This should be technically possible with a calibration option. In the app, I would like the monthly/yearly summary of the individual sports with the distance (hiking/cycling, etc.) and an export option via GPX of my rounds recorded by GPS, for example, to export them to Komoot. Conclusion: Chic watch with reliable smart functions that could still be optimized by update. Super battery life!! Of course, a Gear S3 is smarter, but personally, I haven't missed it so far.
November 8, 2021 | anonymous Offers everything you need The scan-watch makes a high-quality impression and essentially delivers what it promises. The watch is easy and intuitive to use and the accompanying app is excellent in my opinion. The installation and pairing with the iPhone were easy and quickly done. Other smartwatches or fitness trackers can take a leaf out of its book. The only thing that couldn't be achieved was the mentioned battery life. After only four days, the watch was at a level of 25% and thus far from the mentioned 20 to 30 days. Nevertheless, it still offers more performance than other providers. My conclusion: Great watch with good features and everything presented very clearly and packaged in a very nice design.
November 8, 2021 | anonymous Elegant, innovative, highly recommended ???????????? The watch is a birthday present for my son. He is thrilled and very satisfied. He doesn't take off the watch anymore, only to shower.
November 7, 2021 | anonymous Long battery life - Good health features The watch has a really long battery life. I charge it once a week, but I'm pretty sure I could wear it for 2 weeks without charging it. With sleep monitoring, ECG, respiratory rate, and pulse, the watch provides good health information for me. As a 'non-athlete', the functions of step counter, floors climbed, and workouts are completely sufficient and informative. And it looks good too. In addition, you can set which notifications are displayed on the screen (underlined with a vibration alarm), such as incoming emails or appointment reminders and to-dos. If I want to read the whole email, I take out my phone. The relatively small display is therefore not disturbing for me.
November 6, 2021 | anonymous Long battery life, suitable for daily use I was considering the Apple Watch, but I purchased Withings so that I could use it for business as well. It feels natural to use it in daily life and the battery life is long.
November 6, 2021 | anonymous It looks like a watch It looks like a normal watch and yet it can do so much more. I'm impressed by it, and the app was also very easy to install. Another advantage is the long battery life. I can only recommend it.
November 4, 2021 | anonymous Modish and elegant Very good watch, unfortunately no instructions in German language can be found.
November 4, 2021 | anonymous Great product! Recommended! The watch was a perfect gift for my father. He now wears it day and night and is well informed about his heart problems. The only small flaw is that sometimes the watch takes a little longer to transfer data... but otherwise tip top! November 3, 2021 | anonymous A few quirks, but good The watch has a bad shape, which is why it has to be worn really tightly. It is curved outward at the bottom. I didn't have that with my Honor watch. This means that you can't wear it loosely (if you want measurement results). Also, sleep tracking only starts after 3 hours, as the support team told me. However, the support team is very nice. My suggestions regarding sleep tracking were also forwarded to the developers. Let's see if anything changes there. If you don't want to wear your watch tightly, I advise against this watch. If you often sleep less than 3 hours due to sleep problems (waking up is possible, but going to the bathroom destroys the recorded sleep), you should wait. The timer is a bit brutal, but user-friendly. The activity recognition often detected cycling instead of walking for me. This can be easily changed in the app, and with each change, the false detections decrease. I especially like the smart alarm clock, which was removed from the other watch. ECG, oxygen saturation, step measurement, and the resulting values (calories, KM, floors) are usually correct (floors are sometimes overlooked, which is understandable). I also think it's great that the burned calories are displayed on the watch. I also like the analog display of the activity goal very much. The battery life is also very good. But be careful, continuous measurement of oxygen saturation during sleep consumes a lot of battery. However, with the 'on demand' setting, everything is fine again. Charging is fast. If you don't have any problems with paragraph 2, you will be very happy with it. As soon as I can also view sleep recordings under 3 hours (whether by default or by extra function), I will also give it 5 stars (until then 4).
November 3, 2021 | anonymous The ScanWatch is very good The ScanWatch is very good ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ November 2, 2021 | anonymous A truly accurate watch I tested my pulse daily for over 3 weeks on the exercise bike with the chest sensor and I am impressed with the accuracy of the watch. The watch looks like a watch and also goes well with a suit. The app is very good! Worth every euro for me.
November 1, 2021 | anonymous A great watch. Useful for us.
A really beautiful watch.
October 31, 2021 | anonymous Retoure High-quality device - fast return because it is too big and heavy for the wearer October 30, 2021 | anonymous Incorrect time Unfortunately, the time has repeatedly been reset even though the phone was nearby. Restoring factory settings did not help. So I still had to check the time on my phone. Therefore, I returned the watch.
October 29, 2021 | anonymous Don't buy it I bought ScanWatch at October 2020. Now, it already one year passed. However, there is not ECG and SpO2 feature. They said they are working on it. However, there is no guarantee timeline about that. So, don't buy it if you want ECG and SpO2 feature.
October 29, 2021 | anonymous Helpful effective in detecting ventricular fibrillation, general practitioner welcomes the application October 25, 2021 | anonymous Clear purchase recommendation / unbeatable long battery life I have been using the watch for 6 months now. I am thrilled. In contrast to the I-Watch, which has many more functions that you don't need (who makes phone calls or reads messages on their watch), the watch is limited to health functions and does it very well in combination with the app. I travel a lot and can now confirm that the watch lasts at least 20 days without needing to be charged. I can safely leave the charger at home. In contrast, the I-Watch usually needs to be charged after one day. Not to mention the price difference. Clear recommendation.
October 25, 2021 | anonymous Super Watch I've had the watch for 5 days now, first of all, setting it up with the Health Mate app was easy and went smoothly. The watch is very comfortable to wear, especially when receiving messages, it vibrates lightly and you are immediately informed, similar to when waking up... very discreet. All the individual functions such as ECG etc. work perfectly. Regarding the battery, after 5 days, with almost all functions activated, there is still 65% left. So far, I am very satisfied and have not regretted the purchase.
October 24, 2021 | anonymous EKG and battery really last long All good. For health monitoring October 22, 2021 | anonymous Mhmmmm I bought this watch to track cycling. It works quite well so far. What bothers me is that cycling is not included in the fitness level. I cycle an average of 40-60 km... that's sports. The function is okay. But I wouldn't buy it again.
October 21, 2021 | anonymous A very cool SmartWatch Battery last at least 2 Weeks; with the notifications of Instant Messaging like WhatsApp the watch vibrates and hence the battery last less. Nonetheles without notifications and only health programs (walking, running, swimming) the battery last 30 days. No daunt about it. Nice features, oxigen measures and ECG.
October 16, 2021 | anonymous Best health watch! This watch delivers everything promised in the description! The features are impressive and the battery life is equally impressive. Much more expensive watches from well-known apple manufacturers can't keep up. From my point of view, a clear purchase recommendation! October 16, 2021 | anonymous Unstable measurement of blood oxygen levels and high battery consumption I purchased this product with the expectation of measuring my blood oxygen levels, but the accuracy is questionable and the results are often inaccurate even when measured in the correct posture. In addition, it is difficult to measure automatically unless it is tightly fastened to the skin, and realistically, I think that the results will not be accumulated unless it is consciously measured (in the correct posture, pressed down with the opposite hand). Although the battery life has increased from 25 days to 30 days of the previous model, judging from the decrease in battery usage after using it for about half a month, it will last for about 30 days if all the automatic blood oxygen level measurement-related functions are turned off. There are automatic measurements during sleep and several times every three months, but I think that if these are turned on, the maximum benefit of this product, which is long-term operation, will be lost.
October 12, 2021 | anonymous Very good Top battery life. Measurement values are correct.
October 11, 2021 | anonymous SpO2 measurement is now available.
I confirmed that SpO2 can be measured. It takes 30 seconds to measure and will be registered in the application. 2021/10/10 October 10, 2021 | anonymous The watch lives up to its promises!!! The watch is sleek, not bulky or flashy, and has more features than the bulky watches mentioned above (ECG, etc.). The battery lasts easily for a month. Learning to use the individual functions is quick and easy. Now I have an overview of many functions of my body with just one press and turn. I can highly recommend this watch to anyone who is hungry for movement and has heart problems.
October 8, 2021 | anonymous Great watch and unparalleled battery life I’m so happy with my Scanwatch 42mm, but preferred to wait since 24/6/2021 that it arrived for a full review. And I cannot recommend it more! It has accurate HRM & SpO2 sensors, the only smartwatch sporting clinically validated ones. Testing them on a stress test on Sep.23rd against medical equipment (manometer & pulse oximeter) left me positively surprised! The battery is great! 21days under normal use (default HRM & SpO2 sampling, default sleep oximetry and other notifications off). Currently counting day 17, with usage as above PLUS 6/week 1Hr workouts and still with 17% battery left! Its menu is easily accessible via the crown and customisable via the App on my iPhone. the App offers Health insights based on the watch measurements and tips for well being, all of which I came to appreciate in my daily life. The watch is watertight and fully operable under the shower and in the sea (see pic). I love the traditional round watch design (a deciding factor for me) and ut looks nice and sporty in the rubber band it comes with (see pic). I got me a metallic bracelet to match its metallic case, as I simply prefer this look. I cannot stress how great this watch is! October 8, 2021 | anonymous SpO2 measurement is now possible! The long-awaited SpO2 measurement is now available in the Japanese app! The app manual is in English, so it takes some extra effort for me, who is not good at it, but most of it can be understood through videos in the app, so it's not that difficult. As for sleep, sometimes even when I'm lying down reading, it counts as sleep, so that's about the only complaint. The battery life is absolutely satisfying. I stopped using the previous device because it needed to be charged every day and became too much trouble. Now that I don't have to worry about charging and it supports various exercises, I'm starting to enjoy moving my body.
October 8, 2021 | anonymous Quite disappointed I bought the watch because it looked very reliable, the reviews were good and I wanted a watch with a classic design. It also looks nice, especially with a leather strap and comes with a nice felt case. But then I quickly realized that the step counting is quite inaccurate and you can't adjust the step length yourself. (Asked support. Response came quickly, but was not very helpful). Now the Health Mate app on my phone doesn't work anymore. I only see a white screen. So I wanted to install the app on my MacbookPro, which is not even 2 years old, and got the message that it is not compatible with the Health Mate app from Withings. I expected much more from this fitness watch. $Actually, I also wanted to buy the Withings scale, but I won't do that now.
October 7, 2021 | anonymous A great hybrid smartwatch Pros: + accurate/realistic ECG and pulse results + no frills * + good step counter ** + long battery life *** + good workout tracking + notification display **** + good app design + precise sleep tracking function + sapphire glass + waterproof up to 50m Cons: - no built-in GPS * The Withings ScanWatch has only a few functions. Each of these functions is useful and works properly. For example, the pulse sensor. Many smartwatches have pulse sensors. However, they often do not provide realistic values. The ScanWatch can score points here. In addition, it was specially designed for this purpose. ** At first, I found the step counter to be quite inaccurate. And it was. It counted steps when I was lying in bed and moving my arm and so on. But the longer I wore the watch, the better the results became. I don't know if Withings uses algorithms or the like, but after about 2 weeks of use, the step data was quite accurate! *** Withings really advertises its 30-day battery life. To test this, I did a small practical test with the following 'activated' functions: + notifications (incoming calls, text messages) + automatic brightness + oxygen saturation measurement if necessary (manual execution) + automatic breathing scan - quick-look function deactivated I charged the ScanWatch to 100% on 09/15/2021. It held the 100% for about 5 days until it became less. I only had to charge the ScanWatch again on 10/07/2021. So the ScanWatch lasted 22 days. **** The cool thing about the notifications is that you can set whether notifications should be displayed for each app individually. So you can, for example, only display the WhatsApp notifications! CONCLUSION First of all, I'm not a fan of pure smartwatches. I prefer to use Google Maps on a large mobile phone display and answer emails that way. In addition, affordable smartwatches only work with paired mobile phones. I wanted a watch that measures body data independently of the mobile phone and displays it directly. I didn't find a master in the ScanWatch. The processing is stable, robust and yet elegant. Its functions are not senseless and reliable. The hybrid smartwatch was the perfect middle ground for me. I recommend this watch to anyone who thinks about smartwatches the way I do but still wants a watch with additional functions.
October 7, 2021 | anonymous Lots of functions in a discreet package.
Great watch with lots of functions. Only missing blood pressure ;) The battery life is amazing.
October 6, 2021 | anonymous Great Watch A really great watch. It showed me that the nights I felt were bad were actually restful. The app works great, giving me an overview of my sleep duration, sleep quality, average heart rate, interruptions, etc. It works great and has helped me feel more relaxed. I wear it day and night and have all the functions always activated. Of course, the battery doesn't last as long, but then I just recharge it. I wouldn't want to be without it anymore.
September 30, 2021 | anonymous Very nice and functional fitness watch The watch looks very nice and elegant on the wrist. It is not too big, but still offers all the necessary functions. Especially worth mentioning is the long battery life of almost 2 weeks, even with constant wearing. The pairing with the scale also works perfectly.
September 26, 2021 | anonymous Fashionable When the long hand comes to a position where the round screen is not visible, it automatically moves to the position of 10:10.
September 26, 2021 | anonymous The best SmartWatch for me (that doesn't look like one) Very reliable recording of the most important health data including live tracking of activities. Very elegant design! September 25, 2021 | anonymous Sleep quality Weight slightly high September 25, 2021 | anonymous Top Watch Top watch, long battery life, comfortable to wear, looks great. Good data analysis in the app. My focus is more on fitness data and less on making calls with a watch.
September 22, 2021 | anonymous Functionality The smart watch does what it's supposed to do. The EKG and blood oxygen measurements are good. This watch also handles activities well.
September 22, 2021 | anonymous Very nice everyday hybrid watch Very nice watch, comfortable to wear. It provides a very easy overview of activities and health-related data. The app works well and the information on the recorded data is clearly explained. The watch is quick and easy to charge. A plus also for the long battery life.
September 22, 2021 | anonymous Accurate medical O2 measurement Accurate O2 measurement even during the night compared to other smartwatches. Reliable heart rate measurement, good detection of sleep phases and evaluation of sleep. Reliable detection of sports activities. Medically validated ECG recording. Successful further development of the Withings Move ECG. The sapphire glass watch face is also a positive feature. With the Move ECG, the plastic glass often had to be polished with polishing paste to remove scratches.
September 21, 2021 | anonymous Very good Sleep quality September 21, 2021 | anonymous Hybrid Smartwatch Bought to detect atrial fibrillation. Super smartwatch. The best one I've had so far.
September 20, 2021 | anonymous Watch meets expectations This ScanWatch is very easy to set up via the Health Map app.
September 18, 2021 | anonymous Waited over a year for this one! I have been waiting with bated breath for the arrival of this watch to the US. I loved the specs. Unfortunately I ended getting one thru the German channels. The wait was worth it. It has everything I expected and a few extra tricks I was not aware of and love. This is the second Withings unit I own and both have performed as expected. Definitively recommending the ScanWatch! September 18, 2021 | anonymous Classy Watch The watch works as promised. I had a Steel before Withings Nokia, which accompanied me for many years. My highlight even with the old one is the gentle wake-up. That's why I chose a watch and not a ScanWatch, because the appearance of the traditional watch is what I really like.
September 17, 2021 | anonymous EKG, heart rate sensor and steps All good. For improving my fitness and quality of life September 17, 2021 | anonymous Very good display Good day. After installing the APP, it was easy to set up the watch. The functions work perfectly. Everything is easy to read on the watch. The watch has a nice design. Regards, Leo and Simone Dovern.
September 16, 2021 | anonymous Classy fitness watch If you want a fitness watch that is elegant looking, this is for you!Have had the watch for about a month and still learning all the features of the watch and the app which are extensive.The heart rate accuracy seems good although it drops sensing now and then, perhaps my fit needs adjusting.Still early for me to provide a complete evaluation but so far I am very happy with it.
September 16, 2021 | anonymous The best for me! In search of a smartwatch with more battery life, I finally found what I was looking for with Withings. It does everything exactly as I need it to. It displays notifications, has many useful health functions, and has a great battery. The accompanying app is perfect. The connection is super stable and when disconnected, the watch automatically reconnects. The design and build quality are excellent. Finally, I have found what I was looking for.
September 15, 2021 | anonymous Great product The watch was delivered faster than promised! The quality is great: very good material and very well made. The watch is very light, so you don't even notice it while sleeping. I find the EKG and oximeter function very interesting. The app works smoothly and offers many features. The packaging including the charger is also great. The only thing that personally bothers me is the high-gloss glass, which reflects everything strongly and restricts visibility in strong light. Otherwise, everything is great for the price.
September 13, 2021 | anonymous Everything works great so far, sleep monitoring, EKG, oxygen saturation and step counter Not recognizable as a smartwatch, very long battery life and fully charged in 2 hours.
September 12, 2021 | anonymous Best watch I know.
Okay September 11, 2021 | anonymous Very accurate data Top watch, no negative properties found September 11, 2021 | anonymous Reliably collects sports/movement activities I bought the watch used (good). The collaboration with the HealthMateApp works perfectly, so I have a good overview of steps, pulse and sports activities. Further information is also available if needed. At night, the watch sometimes bothers me, so I take it off. The battery lasts about 3 weeks for me. I also use the scale and blood pressure monitor and have the most important data clearly displayed in one app (data export is also possible).
September 10, 2021 | anonymous Don't buy this watch for ECG When I bought this watch I expected the ECG feature to be activated in Canada after a short delay. I was wrong. No ECG in Canada. Pity September 9, 2021 | anonymous Great Watch With this watch, I can reliably take my EKG, and it also displays incoming messages! September 7, 2021 | anonymous Great fitness and health watch with incredible battery life I bought the 38mm watch 2 months ago at Media Markt for €247 and I'm absolutely thrilled. What a great technical device! As far as battery life is concerned, I thought at first: 'Ok, marketing blabla. It will probably only last a week'. But: I was on vacation in Sweden from 15.08 to 29.08. On 13.08, I charged the watch and intentionally left the charger at home. In Sweden, I tracked a workout every morning including GPS and route recording (about 1 hour), then swimming in the lake during the day and measuring ECG / blood oxygen once a week. Sleep tracking and heart rate measurement were always on, breath control off. Well, what can I say.... Now that I'm writing these lines (07.09.), the watch is at 15%..... That's exactly why I bought this watch! The normal smartwatches (Apple/Garmin/Samsung) all fail for me because of the battery. I don't need colorful big displays, I just want the most important information. I know myself and know that I wouldn't wear the other watches if I had to charge them all the time. That already annoys me with the phone.... The pedometer works very well, I counted along. The inaccuracy is 2-3 steps per 100. My smartphone (Pixel 4a) counts completely wrong there. What I would criticize: - The recognition of sports sometimes doesn't work properly - A second hand is missing - Export of tracks would be nice Otherwise: Brilliant piece. I also like the Healthmate app more and more. At first, I found it a bit confusing, but now I find my way around it well. The suggestions the app makes for performance improvement and such also seem sensible to me. Conclusion: So if you're looking for a 'normal-looking' watch with a bunch of health features and really long battery life, you should check out the Scanwatch. But if you want apps and everything possible on the watch, you're definitely in the wrong place with Withings.
September 7, 2021 | anonymous Quality with many features Very good workmanship. Housing like cast without disturbing screws. Looks very flat, not as bulky as most smartwatches. The many functions can be easily accessed via the crown. The small sharp screen is also very easy to read in brightness. The time is always accurate as it is synchronized via the mobile phone. The position of the hands can be calibrated exactly via the app. They hit the indices on the dial exactly...TOP... The hands release the screen when activated if they are just covering it. The app is extensive and clear. There are many sports modes. Medical data can also be sent to the family doctor. The ECG can be printed as a PDF file. The battery life is very long. With moderate use, it lasts for 30 days! After that, there is an emergency mode of 20 days. The watch does not have to be charged every day, like many other smartwatches. All in all, a successful concept at a fair price.
September 6, 2021 | anonymous Enjoy comprehensive health monitoring! I needed a new watch: during my research, I found watches that record many health reports. I liked the design and price of the W. Scan Watch. It arrived the next day! The description could be a bit more detailed for older people, but I managed it anyway. It's great that you can write and display EKG, the O2 measurement didn't work at first, but it works now, the many steps and floors you collect during the day are interesting. Cycling is displayed separately, but sometimes the watch doesn't record the continuation after a break!? It's shocking to me how little I really sleep, I'm trying to improve that. I have the 38mm watch, it could be a bit smaller for my thin arm. All in all, I have a lot of fun with the watch, a friend also ordered this watch and is thrilled! September 5, 2021 | anonymous Qualitatively very high-quality watch! Very good and high-quality product ???? September 5, 2021 | anonymous Saved by the alarm that wakes me up at the right time when I'm sleeping lightly The alarm that wakes me up when I'm sleeping lightly is the best! I'm really saved because I'm weak in the morning... I've been using it since the previous model SteelHR. I didn't have a habit of wearing a watch before, but this one has a good design, is highly functional, and can be worn all the time because it lasts for about a month on a single charge!! September 3, 2021 | anonymous Withings scanwatch Recommend the watch to anybody looking for a reliable watch. One downfall is the ECG does not work in Canada yet.
September 3, 2021 | anonymous Very good The watch meets all expectations September 2, 2021 | anonymous What a Fantastic Hybrid Watch! Was really concerned after reading all the critical reviews but decided to try it myself as Amazon return policy is better than returning stuff to my mother. Wow! Lovely watch. The battery life is simply insane. The display is subdued and very classy. Bought the Steel HR and then the Scanwatch (No BP in Canada - pending federal approval) but oxygen, sleep, steps, calories, notifications (Telegram, email, SMS, voice, Signal, etc.) work flawlessly. Of course, it's a fleeting moment as it scrolls by. Keep your reading glasses ready. MINUS: The vibration, while much better than Steel Sport HR, it sure isn't strong enough if you are not alert. But then, probably the battery gets killed faster. After using regular Smartwatches with a whole bunch of features (an overkill), the Withings Scanwatch is a breath of fresh air. Also, I believe they have updated the firmware as it tracks steps even without moving your hand. Tried it on elliptical and it works. Walk with your hands behind your back - and it tracks well. The minimalist tiny notification circle is really cool. I got the larger watch and initially, felt too large but then, the display is larger and easier on the eyes. Oh yeah! That tiny secondary goal window is brilliant! No need to turn on the watch to check steps. Unsure why some don't dig the application but I LOVE the Health Mate app. Very classy design and doesn't run your smartphone battery down. Of course, you need to have Location, Bluetooth, Battery ON and Optimization Off. My review on the Withings Sport HR has more information regarding this. Bought the Withings leather band. Pricey but nice! The band that comes with it is good too. More stretchable & breathable than leather. Withings actually recommends the silicone band over leather for workouts. Great buy. 10 stars.
September 2, 2021 | anonymous Overall okay Overall, the watch does what it's supposed to do. The only drawback is the unreliable heart rate measurement, there are always outliers up and down, even though the watch is always worn correctly (according to the instructions). So the heart rate data should only be understood as a (very) rough guide.
September 1, 2021 | anonymous A beautiful watch I really like the very simple operation. I don't like that the light keeps turning off during the stopwatch and interrupts me when I stop.
August 31, 2021 | anonymous Very nice watch with super battery life.
What I like best about it is that the battery lasts a very long time.
August 28, 2021 | anonymous Reliable Recording The watch arrived quickly as usual, was securely packaged and set up quickly via the app. I bought it to detect possible atrial fibrillation in time, as I had just had heart surgery for this reason. Monitoring the pulse is also important and works reliably. I have compared the values several times with my Omrom. I replaced the silicone strap with a leather one because I cannot tolerate silicone. The leather straps in 18 mm from Marburger are recommended if you want to move away from the usual black, brown or blue. Overall, I am impressed with the high-quality and (in the small version) elegant watch.
August 28, 2021 | anonymous Health check Sleep app, saturation and EKG have been used for about 5 weeks for monitoring. Very satisfied.
August 27, 2021 | anonymous Partially inaccurate The design and processing are high-quality, the app provides a lot of information. EKG and oxygen measurement works excellently. Unfortunately, I had two points that I didn't like: At night, the watch consumed about 15% of the battery and at the same time, either there was no recording available or it was incorrect (see photos). This means that it only runs for 5-6 days, far from the targeted 30 days, so the manufacturer should provide more realistic data. Since sleep recording was important to me, I cannot use such non-existent or incorrect data, most of the time 1.5-2 hours were missing at the beginning or end if it was recorded at all. Too bad, otherwise this watch would have received full marks from me, maybe I just had a 'Monday watch'.
August 26, 2021 | anonymous Average - inaccurate pulse values during training August 25, 2021 | anonymous Good classic design I like the look of a regular watch. With all the functions of a smartwatch plus the EKG and oxygen saturation functions.
August 24, 2021 | anonymous I am very satisfied with the watch. Better than I imagined! The alarm function makes my waking up much more pleasant. I would have to organize an EKG watch. And the watch does what it has to. It fits perfectly on the wrist for almost all outfits. Battery lasts easily 4 weeks. I am positively impressed.
August 23, 2021 | anonymous Super Design, strong features I already have the Steel HR and Steel HR Sport from Withings. After a short switch to the Apple Watch, now the Scanwatch. The watch looks great and has all the important features: heart rate, step counter, sleep quality and a really good app (Health Mate). Battery life is good at just over two weeks, but not as advertised at almost 4 weeks. Bottom line: absolutely recommendable! August 23, 2021 | anonymous Works well Looks attractive August 22, 2021 | anonymous Ist sehr gut Alles August 22, 2021 | anonymous Super Analog Watch with Health Functions! Absolutely recommended watch in functionality and appearance with super application functions! August 17, 2021 | anonymous Top watch with minor flaws (There are hardly any 18 mm straps for the 38 mm watch) I am generally satisfied with the watch and would recommend it. Especially in combination with other Withings products and the focus on the health sector / web interface, the watch is ahead of the game! The app integration is good, especially with other Withings devices such as scales, blood pressure, etc. That doesn't mean everything is already 100% optimal, but I have tried several watches before and this one is the best for me. Especially with the web interface, which I almost exclusively use, all values can be exported somehow via screenshot or print function or printed in a PDF. For an overview, there is a PDF export in the app, the service is reachable and committed and apparently also working on the app. There is no export function for GPS routes 75%. I don't use notifications and I'm not particularly interested in the gimmicks of other smartwatches. The free calorie counter from myfitnesspal is integrated into the app, which I already used before and it's really great. The exchange of data takes place via the app on the smartphone and unfortunately not server-side, which can sometimes lead to problems. 75% (reboot usually helps) Recognizing sports or starting training manually (with GPS map) works perfectly. Unfortunately, oxygen measurement or ECG during training does not work while recording a track. If you use automatic recognition without a GPS track, it works, or you interrupt the track recording, but then you have two half maps in the overview at the end. 65% (That could really be solved differently!) The sleep function is unproblematic for inconspicuous dormouse sleepers. However, if you have a light sleep or wake up more often and maybe don't reach the minimum sleep time of 3 hours without getting up, you may not get any sleep recording at all. The start or end is not always correctly recognized, sometimes hours are missing, and manual correction is not possible. REM sleep is not detected at all, usually too much deep sleep, overall so-so. A small rigid motivational attempt to sleep a little more for those who like to see another green box in the overview. 25% (Fitbit watches are much better here in terms of pure sports & sleep) I opted for the smaller 38 mm version (18 mm wide strap), in retrospect I should have taken the 40 mm watch (20 mm wide strap) because there are simply many more straps available for it. The supplied silicone strap is almost always damp and causes pimples. A flexible nylon strap is better ventilated and more comfortable to wear, with 20 mm the selection would be large. 50% Runtime is completely sufficient, runs for several days with all functions and small display. During showering, the watch is quickly recharged, runtime is completely inconspicuous. 85% (The Galaxy Watch, on the other hand, already had problems lasting a day) August 17, 2021 | anonymous ScanWatch is Great! This watch does a very good job of tracing steps, sleep patterns including heartbeat and O2 rates.Looks great, more like a 'real' watch then a fitness tracker.Does not currently do ECG monitoring in Canada which is hopefully included soon.
August 12, 2021 | anonymous Overall very satisfied Unfortunately, I often have cycling in the app even though I don't have a bike and I'm not always moving. The first time I was sitting at the dentist. The app said cycling. Now, whenever my heart rate goes up, cycling appears, which I don't like at all. This is not what I imagine automatic detection to be like. Unfortunately, there is no Nordic walking in the workouts. It's quite different from hiking or walking...
August 11, 2021 | anonymous Looks great and does what it's supposed to do! Top It can do so much!!! Heart rate, sleep quality, EKG, steps, and much more!!! Just top!!! Five stars!!! August 10, 2021 | anonymous My wife says: recommended Blood pressure, heart rate and sleep behavior are recorded relatively accurately. Wearing comfort is good.
August 6, 2021 | anonymous Watch and Health Companion The ScanWatch and the Health Mate app always let you know what your fitness and health level is.
August 4, 2021 | anonymous The watch runs perfectly I really liked the watch, all functions work perfectly and I am always well informed about my health status. I can only recommend it.
August 2, 2021 | anonymous Super Smartwatch with good sleep monitoring and heart functions as well as oxygen saturation I really like the precise sleep monitoring, with sleep depth and wake phases as well as heart and oxygen saturation. The manual measurement of blood oxygen levels is okay but could be improved (sometimes repeated measurements are required to get a value), but it is almost identical to my parallel measurement with a finger pulse oximeter. Good recording of ECG. The automatic recording of cycling activity also works well, only the route recording via the GPS of the mobile phone has not worked so far.
August 2, 2021 | anonymous Very nice watch with health functions and some drawbacks Very nice watch without frills and with many health functions. The battery lasts at least a week. ECG and blood oxygen are exactly the functions I wanted. Very good connection to the Health Mate app and to Google Fit. The only thing that doesn't work quite right is the pedometer (drying your hair with a towel once = 200 steps), but the distance walked is correct again. Also, the counting of floors is not quite as precise. But all in all a very good overall package.
August 1, 2021 | anonymous Great watch with understandable software.
The watch was a gift for my mother. The setup was done in a few minutes and the watch works really great. Easy to understand, simple to use and has a super long battery life.
July 31, 2021 | anonymous Ideal for checking heart function Long battery life; well-functioning app July 30, 2021 | anonymous Super Sehr gute App July 30, 2021 | anonymous Some good, some bad I bought a Withings ScanWatch about three months ago. I previously had a Withings Move watch and was happy with it. One of the reasons that I bought a Withings smartwatch, as opposed to a FitBit, is that Withings is a French-owned company. Since Europe has strong privacy laws, I assumed that the Withings watch would be more protective of privacy than FitBit, which is owned by Google. However, I later learned that the Withings HealthMate app will not work properly unless the app has access to my location all the time. Not only is this an unnecessary invasion of privacy, it also creates compatibility issues with newer Google phones. By default, newer Google phones discourage users from giving apps unnecessary permissions.The SPO2 feature, which was one of the main reasons that I decided to upgrade to the ScanWatch, usually gives an inconclusive result, but its other features (step counter, sleep tracking, fitness tracking) work well. The other reason that I purchased the ScanWatch is the EKG feature. However, this feature does not seem to be available, perhaps because I am in Canada.I found Withings Customer Service to be a bit spotty. I recently had an issue with the factory reset not working properly. Instead of resetting, it would display the Hello screen. I contacted Customer Service via the website and got no response. I then contacted Customer Service via telephone and the issue got resolved.
July 30, 2021 | anonymous Would take it again! Very chic simple smart watch that offers me what I was looking for. Technically very good functions, which are presented very clearly in the corresponding app. The very long battery life of about 3 weeks also convinced me.
July 28, 2021 | anonymous Very good ScanWatch I am very satisfied with the ScanWatch. The long battery life is also excellent. Highly recommended.
July 26, 2021 | anonymous Scanwatch It is a good alternative to other smartwatches. For the display, I would prefer black font on a white background for readability. It would be nice if the available metal bands fit all models and also for larger wrists (up to 23cm or more). A payment and phone function would also be desirable. Sleep is not always recorded (e.g. nap time) July 26, 2021 | anonymous Top product, highly recommended !!! It is somewhat complicated to delete the old profile.
July 25, 2021 | anonymous Scanwatch, lives up to what I expected...
I have been using the Scanwatch in the 42 mm version for several weeks now and would like to give a summary of it. I use it for swimming and cycling, for continuous heart rate monitoring as well as the number of steps taken per day. At irregular intervals, the watch also checks for breathing disorders at night. Oxygen saturation can also be determined at any time. In my opinion, the ECG function rounds off the whole thing very well. And yet the battery lasts for about 25 days for me. With daily heart rate monitoring, sleep monitoring and at least 30 sports monitoring. I also use the alarm function, the vibration is sufficient for me to wake up. The overall package was also the reason why I chose this watch. I didn't want to have to charge it every day. So all in all, the Scanwatch works very well. I have the app running on my iPad, it also works very well and so far without any problems. I would buy the watch again.
July 25, 2021 | anonymous Accidentally rated poorly The poor rating was a mistake, sorry, it was for a different product.
July 25, 2021 | anonymous Lili The watch is just right for me at 38 cm, was delivered quickly and everything was fine, everything works without problems. The app also works, everything is transmitted via Bluetooth and it is clear. The only downside is that it does not measure blood pressure, unfortunately you have to buy an extra device from Winthings to have the data on an app. But otherwise, I can definitely recommend it.
July 25, 2021 | anonymous Doesn't count for me (always?), when the left hand is carrying something...
At first, I blamed the age of my old pedometer for the fact that the Withings Scanwatch counted significantly fewer steps. Such a modern high-end device should be able to do much better. Then I realized that it doesn't count when I push a shopping cart, and also when I carry a shopping basket. This was just before the end of the return period, which is why I returned the watch as quickly as possible. I accumulate many steps through small paths at work, often holding something in my hand. I couldn't test anymore under which exact circumstances the Scanwatch doesn't count, but others may find out... It's a beautiful, sturdy and elegant-looking watch with many great features, but for me, counting steps correctly is still a very important function. Two stars deduction....
July 24, 2021 | anonymous Top product.
Simply recommendable.
July 21, 2021 | anonymous Very good with minor flaws Functions such as sleep duration or activities are sometimes faulty. Sleep duration sometimes allegedly only 3-4 hours. Awake at 3 am? Otherwise OK, long battery life, simple ECG and oxygen measurements. Software update could bring improvement.
July 20, 2021 | anonymous Top Product I have tested the Scanwatch for a long time. High-quality top product. Genuine understatement. In terms of battery life and medical performance, it is probably unparalleled. The Health App is great. Absolute purchase recommendation for all those who can do without paying attention to the watch, staring endlessly at it, and also giving up music and communication in a double pack.
July 20, 2021 | anonymous The position of the needle is off.
The positions of the hour and minute hands are off at the 12 o'clock position. It is unclear whether it was a defect or not. Please check the position of the needle upon arrival. If it is defective, we would like it to be replaced, but it may not be possible.
July 19, 2021 | anonymous Perfect Smartwatch Perfectly recorded EKG; logical and secure operation; elegant simple design July 18, 2021 | anonymous Perfect Scanwatch for Sleep, Breathing, ECG and Sports Analysis I was looking for a watch that monitors heart and especially sleep, and this watch does it perfectly. Sleep and breathing are recorded clearly and displayed in the mobile app. The alarm clock works perfectly, and the app is very user-friendly. A simple timer/stopwatch is also available and very practical. ECG, pulse, and oxygen saturation also work very well and are easy to use, I'm impressed. Especially since I bought the watch from Warehouse as a second choice and couldn't find any defects, simply top.
July 18, 2021 | anonymous This hybrid SmartWatch is worth your money! This SmartWatch is worth every penny. It offers top values and is very accurate. I have worn several SmartWatches, but none came close to this one. The design could be a bit more modern, but that is certainly in the eye of the beholder. I give a clear buying recommendation.
July 17, 2021 | anonymous Function and optics are great.
Easy to set up and use. Connection between watch and phone is fast and the task values are very accurate. Exercises such as walking or cycling are clearly displayed on the phone screen. Great watch.
July 13, 2021 | anonymous Super does what it's supposed to do very well, provides all the information and looks good too. Top July 13, 2021 | anonymous Works well with app After 4 days: works reliably, communication with app is great (without app, useful utilization is very limited).
July 12, 2021 | anonymous New Watch I used to have (and still own) a Garmin. The Withings is less conspicuous and only serves as a watch. The function is just as good, if not better than the Garmin. But that's a conversation about what I find more beautiful: blue or red? I'm satisfied. The battery life is great if you don't strain the battery and want to know the values every 5 minutes. I still have to try it on the bike :).
July 9, 2021 | anonymous Customer satisfaction does what it's supposed to do. The highly reflective glass is not that great. I'm glad I have it.
July 9, 2021 | anonymous Good features, weak battery life.
Good measurements. Practical due to automatic functions or warnings for AFib. However, when using the ScanWatch, charging is already required after eight days.
July 7, 2021 | anonymous A very good choice.
I am completely satisfied, especially with the long battery life.
July 6, 2021 | anonymous Perfekt! The best watch!!!! July 6, 2021 | anonymous Top Smartwatch for everyday use Very well made, small smartwatch. Fits even on narrow wrists and looks elegant. Maybe not necessarily suitable for top athletes, but with many functions for vital monitoring! Clear recommendation! July 2, 2021 | anonymous Better than the AppleWatch - I never thought I'd say that.
First of all, I have to confess. I used to be a pretty big Apple fan. I like the interoperability of the Apple cosmos. It's just easy... period. So I had the Apple Watch on my wrist for years. For jogging, occasionally taking an EKG to record my extrasystoles, and as a timepiece. Sometimes I use Siri. But one thing annoyed me incredibly. Even if it was only for two hours, the watch had to be on the charging station EVERY day. So it was always empty when I wanted to use it, even if it was just to display the time. That's why I looked for an alternative and ended up with Withings. I knew the manufacturer because I own a scale from him and therefore already knew about the good quality. The app was already installed and had never been negative. So I struck on Prime Day. And what can I say. After a week of use, I'm thrilled and will never give it up. Everything about this watch is right. I already use the functions quite intensively. Daily EKG and oxygen saturation, activity and sleep tracking. Battery lasts forever. After 8 days, it's still 45%. And I enjoy having a watch again that shows me the time at any time. The design is great. Not intrusive. But high quality. I bought an Archer Band (see another review from me). Fits like a glove and I really like it now. I'm curious if the sapphire glass is really more scratch-resistant. Let's see what my rating looks like in a year, but so far: 100% recommendation. Everything was done right here.
June 30, 2021 | anonymous Presentation of heart functions Very clear functions, good controls, comfortable on the arm. Sometimes the glass reflects strongly, then data is hardly readable.
June 30, 2021 | anonymous Watch works as it should The watch looks good, I exchanged the strap for a high-quality, very flexible metal strap because it was uncomfortable on my arm at night. Now clear recommendation. The app was cumbersome when pairing with the iPhone 8. After uninstalling and reinstalling, it strangely worked.
June 29, 2021 | anonymous 👍 Exactly as I imagined it. I am absolutely thrilled and can only recommend this watch.
June 25, 2021 | anonymous First Impression I have only had this watch for 14 days, so I cannot give an overall verdict yet. It makes a very good impression and I am very satisfied with the watch and its known capabilities so far. I also have the appropriate app for it. Setting it up was easy and everything has been working as it should in conjunction with the app. In combination with a corresponding scale, which I have owned for years and is compatible with this app, it is a good combination that helps me, as a senior, to keep my health and fitness somewhat balanced.
June 25, 2021 | anonymous Stylish watch with many health functions Recommended by a friend, I ordered this Scan watch and I must say I am very satisfied with the price-performance ratio, the operation and the results. Thanks to the mobile app, the Scan watch is easy to use and I also bought some additional models from Withings (scale and blood pressure monitor). Especially regarding the sleep quality, I was very surprised about the results and will probably have to change my sleep habits in the future. Without the Scan watch, I would not have become aware of this. I particularly like that the glass is scratch-resistant and that the watch can be charged via USB and has a long battery life.
June 25, 2021 | anonymous No Plans to Enable ECG Function Bought mine last year without knowing the ECG function wasn’t approved in Canada, so Withings won’t turn it on. They have no plans to get the device certified.Also, the glass is very, very reflective making the dial hard to read, and it’s hard to see the hands in general depending on the lighting situation.
June 24, 2021 | anonymous Best Fitness Watch ever Very fast delivery. The app delivers what it promises. Easy to use. I particularly like the breathing monitoring at night. If set to automatic, monitoring is performed every 3 months. The EKG is also easy to perform. I feel safer now that I am already 68 years old.
June 23, 2021 | anonymous Scanwatch + Very easy to install and clear, Fast delivery. - However, at this price, I miss a German operating manual.
June 22, 2021 | anonymous Okay as a standalone health tracker, but connectivity is appalling.
I purchased this watch as I wanted a hybrid watch health tracker which would connect to my iPhone 12. The watch itself looks great and the watch face is large enough to read easily, with the luminous hands being easy to see in all levels of light. The upper display provides health information in a clear and simplified way, with the lower dial showing your daily personal step goal progress. The step counter, floor counter, ECG, SPO2 and sleep monitor all work well and appear fairly accurate. It is a fairly heavy watch, but I do not find it uncomfortable to wear during the night for sleep tracking. The battery is supposed to last 28 days or so, and I have been charging it every 20 days when the battery drops to about 20-30%, that is with taking extra readings each day, so 28 days seems about right. As for notifications and connectivity with my iPhone 12, it is a complete flop. I move a couple of metres away from my phone and the connection is lost. I then have to reconnect the watch by manually using the settings menu on me iPhone, as the watch will not reconnect itself. This makes the notifications features on the watch totally unusable. This may be an iOS problem, I don't know, but online forums strongly suggest that I am not alone with this issue (Android included). The watch syncs (when connected) with the Withings Health Mate app (and Apple Health if you wish), which in turn syncs with your online Withings profile. Data is data, all pretty good and well laid out. I really like the look of the watch and the health data it records, but the connectivity issues are such that it ruins the experience for me. For such an important feature to be unusable, causes the rating to lose 3 stars. (Think of an Apple Watch that permanently lost connection to an iPhone every time you moved a couple of metres away!?) If the connectivity problems are sorted, I would buy again, otherwise, this is a single purchase.
June 21, 2021 | anonymous Mixed feedback so far I have only been using the watch for about 24 hours, so the review will change again. So far, most of the measurements are satisfactory and correspond to the readings obtained by pharmacy devices. This applies to pulse and oxygen saturation. The monitoring of breathing and sleep feels like it corresponds to the actual quality. What has not worked reliably so far is the ECG function. According to it, I have had permanent AF since yesterday, which is not true. Perhaps the function is error-prone due to the current heat and sweaty skin. Let's see how it is next week, when significantly cooler temperatures are expected. The review will be updated in about a week.
June 19, 2021 | anonymous Beautiful watch, battery life greatly exaggerated.
In terms of design, an elegant and timeless watch with useful features. The watch feels high-quality and can be worn with a suit for special occasions without any issues. The delivered data also seems correct. I compared it with a Huawei GT 2 and they are practically identical. However, what is completely untrue is the battery life of supposedly up to 30 days. I lost 12 percent within 12 hours. You can do the math to see when the battery will run out. Now, the monitoring functions are turned off at night. Let's see how much battery life it loses now. My Huawei loses 5 percent in 24 hours with all parameters turned on. Just a heads up.
June 16, 2021 | anonymous Great device! Great watch with many sophisticated features. Very well made, the small display is actually sufficient. The connection to the Android app works perfectly. However, in sunshine, the display is not readable, hence one star deduction.
June 15, 2021 | anonymous Works without any problems The watch looks good visually, only the bracelet looks very cheap, but can be easily replaced. The functions of the watch are all okay so far, I cannot say whether the measurements hold up to comparison, but I trust that the values are more or less correct. It's a shame that the watch doesn't have a second hand. However, I find the information about the battery life of the watch to be cheeky. 30 days are absolutely unrealistic! I completely charged the watch 5 days ago and the current battery level is at 25%. During this time, I have done 2 EKGs and measured my oxygen saturation twice. Otherwise, I also display my sleep and have set all the necessary settings to be economical or automatic. Otherwise, I just read the time. I assume that those who use the watch moderately can expect a maximum of 7 to 10 days of battery life. Anyone who expects longer battery life is probably not well advised with this watch. The charger is reasonable and charges the watch completely in about 3 hours.
June 14, 2021 | anonymous Robust and gives me security Strong watch with many good features. Don't want to do without it anymore. Robust and reliable. The app is also excellent, except for sleep detection. Longer wake phases are defined as sleeping. The watch gives me security after a heart attack. One battery charge lasts at least two weeks. So I can wear it at night and it monitors my functions without being plugged in.
June 13, 2021 | anonymous Notification is not working properly Actually great watch, but the notification doesn't work properly. If you are near the phone, it works, but as soon as you are a bit away, it doesn't work anymore. For such an expensive watch, this is not acceptable, that's why I returned it.
June 11, 2021 | anonymous Fulfilled all my expectations Does everything claimed and does it well. The results apps for smartphone and browser are great with some showing long-term averages. SPO2 often requires several attempts to get a result. However, in addition to monitoring sleep quality, this watch monitors SPO2 during sleep (an unexpected bonus for those of us concerned about sleep apnea).
June 11, 2021 | anonymous Smartwatch Top Smartwatch, many features and evaluations. Good quality June 4, 2021 | anonymous A very good smartwatch that lacks nothing.
I have had this watch for half a year. Simply a great product. I myself - work in the construction industry - am totally surprised by the strength of the glass, I wear it every day and there is not a single tiny scratch. The functions are very good. I can only recommend it.
June 4, 2021 | anonymous The watch has good features in general. Unfortunately, blood pressure measurement is still missing.
Sometimes the data is not transferred to the app or is incomplete.
June 3, 2021 | anonymous Bought it for my wife too. She is also very satisfied Everything is very good. Works perfectly June 3, 2021 | anonymous Good watch with one drawback I have to say I love the watch. The battery lasts forever, so you forget where the charger was stored. Unfortunately, after a month, the crown was worn out (the pressure point was always sluggish and when turning the crown, you felt resistance). I then exchanged the watch. Unfortunately, after 2 months, the same problem started with the replacement watch. So I have now parted with the watch and hope that this flaw will be eliminated in the next revision.
June 3, 2021 | anonymous EKG and Sports Functions I have been using the Scanwatch daily for about 5 weeks and I am very satisfied. I have used many different sports/scan watches, but none were as easy to install and use as the Scanwatch. I bought the Scanwatch on the recommendation of my cardiologist.
June 3, 2021 | anonymous The third one is now okay, it's probably a new version / software.
The first delivery was, in my opinion, a defective return. The replacement delivery seemed new and worked perfectly. A nice alternative for those who don't need a rubber block with (for a not so young user) fitness programs. Vital functions are recorded in partial medical quality and the look of the watch is also great, whether with a rubber or Milanese strap. Unfortunately, the second one also had a (in retrospect probably subjective) error in step counting. I am fully satisfied with the new one.
June 2, 2021 | anonymous Best hybrid watch on the market.
-Floor counting is poor. -Sleep detection not precise. +Robust. +The app is very well designed (better than Apple's), occasional connection problems. +Step detection is very good. +The manufacturer's support is good. I waited 7 days for a response but then had intensive contact until the problem was solved. Despite the high price, the price-performance ratio is still okay.
June 2, 2021 | anonymous Classy Its good in its own way. Can not be compared to other products.
May 30, 2021 | anonymous Must have health monitoring WITHINGS offers excellent quality for ECG, oxygen saturation, pulse, fitness activities and much more. In combination with the Health Mate app, it is a very good product. Easy to use, very good functionality.
May 30, 2021 | anonymous Analog watches are good I have two smartphones. I have been using Fitbit connected to my Android smartphone for about 3 years. This time, I connected Withings to my iPhone and started using it. 'Quality of the compatible app': Since I am used to using Fitbit, I am not yet familiar with this app and find it difficult to use in various ways. 'Help with sleep': The difference with Fitbit occasionally bothers me. I think it depends on how to determine the dozing state on a chair before getting into bed, but I think Fitbit is better in this regard (it may just be a matter of getting used to it). 'Battery life': Withings is overwhelmingly good. Even though it is a general smartwatch, it lasts for about 30 days, which is attractive because you don't have to worry about it. It feels like adding smartwatch functions to an analog watch, and I'm happy because I originally liked analog watches. I replaced the strap with a commercially available leather strap, and I think the design is also stylish. If I dare say, I wanted a second hand and I would be even happier if the notification area was in Japanese...
May 30, 2021 | anonymous It hurts me in my heart: Well-intentioned, but the display! I rarely write reviews. Firstly, because usually my opinion has already been expressed by others, and secondly, because I don't think it's necessary to give my two cents on everything. Here I make an exception. First of all: I love Withings products. I have everything from the sleep tracker to the scale to the BPM Core. The things are high quality, can be easily integrated into everyday life, and work simply. I also think that the app - in contrast to some reviews here - is very well structured and intuitive. So it's not surprising that I also ordered the Scanwatch. My old smartwatch, Huawei GT2, can do everything except ECG, but the data is logically not stored in the Healthmate app, but in the Huawei equivalent. And the watch doesn't look nearly as good on the wrist. What can I say, the watch looks very high quality, has many functions, is easy to pair and works well. So what's the problem? THE DISPLAY! That's a complete disaster!! An OLED display is characterized by high brilliance and detail, but is not very bright. I mean not bright at all. I mean: You can't see a thing in daylight. Nothing, niente. Hasn't anyone noticed this?? You try to fly to your desired function via the crown and you're already secretly looking for a shady spot because you can't see anything on the display. The picture realistically shows what you can't see in daylight (in this case the digital time). It has happened to me several times in the last few days that I got 'stuck' in one of the functions and the hands didn't adjust to the time anymore, i.e. in many cases I couldn't read anything on the watch anymore. That annoyed me incredibly and that's why I only give the watch one point, despite its high quality and other positive aspects, because in my opinion it is simply poorly designed. By the way: When I can finally read the display in a dark environment, I need glasses because it is too small. ;-) May 28, 2021 | anonymous Excellent wristwatch The quality of the watch is very, very good! The results are identical compared to my stationary blood pressure / pulse meter. Super long battery life and fast charging time. The included app is the best I've seen so far. Great compliment! May 27, 2021 | anonymous Health-Sport-Watch!!! Ideal for my sports and health interests. Everything is good and easy to use.
May 27, 2021 | anonymous Good, stylish watch; unfortunately bad portal/bad app I bought the Withings ScanWatch as a tracker (activity and sleep) as a supplement to my Coros running watch. Since I mainly use TrainingPeaks as a portal for training, a smooth exchange of data was/is important to me. Since this does not work well, I am returning the watch. + stylish watch (not _quite_ my taste, but that's individual; it IS stylish) + good features (ECG, oxygen saturation) + measurements (steps, sleep, etc.) + long battery life - most importantly: the app/portal Health Mate is almost closed: export still works, import (externally recorded activities, measurements such as weight) can hardly be imported (detours via RunKeeper, AppleHealth only work rudimentarily and not reliably) - the app is not very clear, overloaded - I can only find what I want to see after a long search In summary, I have decided to return the watch and try market leader Fitbit (yes, not at all _stylish_ ;-) ) May 26, 2021 | anonymous Do not buy it Not working correctly. no records after one nights. Heart monitoring functions are not working.I am disapointed.
May 26, 2021 | anonymous A great watch, super features and it looks classic Great product, all information in the app is clear. I can only recommend it and it doesn't look like a children's watch. It would be great if the watch could also measure blood pressure.
May 25, 2021 | anonymous Very easy to live with.
Nice non-smartwatch style. Great battery life. Very easy to use. Nice fit on the wrist like a normal watch. Has good activity tracking. And the ECG is very useful (if u need it). Just wear it and forget it, not intrusive like full smartwatch experience. I track my cycling (mtb) and walking with no issues. And the app is very good too.
May 25, 2021 | anonymous Cool gadget The watch is elegant and beautiful. The battery life is phenomenal and for me one of the most important criteria for a 'smartwatch' (compared to other manufacturers F....it). The bands can be easily exchanged. The included silicone strap is not ideal for me in the summer, as you sweat quickly underneath it. The synchronization with messages and display on the watch face also works more reliably than with others.
May 24, 2021 | anonymous Connection to mobile phone Easy to use, very good connection to mobile phone, bracelet very tolerable, even at night you can see the hands May 23, 2021 | anonymous Top smartwatch with long battery life and unique features I bought the Scanwatch as an upgrade because it offers, among other things, an EKG function and a warning for atrial fibrillation, and it can monitor sleep. It measures oxygen saturation, automatically detects various activities, and has many other functions. The app is very user-friendly, and data exchange with Apple Health is guaranteed. It is comfortable to wear, the battery lasts a long time, and I am extremely satisfied. I chose the large size because I have a large wrist. Clear recommendation from me! May 23, 2021 | anonymous Extensive measurements such as pulse, ECG, sleep monitoring plus fitness tracker First of all, the only downside that affects not only me according to forums and reviews is the original bracelet causing skin irritations, especially where the loop is. Actually, this bracelet should not cause any irritation due to the material. But this seems to be a relatively common issue. Technically, I cannot say anything negative. The control is completely intuitive only via the crown and you quickly reach the desired function. You can also set up a quick start option, which either starts the ECG or the measurement of oxygen saturation. Unfortunately, not everything can be set directly on the watch, such as the alarm. Configuration is done exclusively through the app. Briefly about the alarm. It has the option of 'intelligent waking up'. If the watch detects that you are no longer in deep sleep before the actual wake-up time, the watch wakes you up earlier so that you are not woken up from deep sleep. The time span can be freely configured. For me, it is set to 10 minutes and it works great. As for the values I can check, the measurements are precise. Only with the steps, as with pretty much all devices, there are deviations. But they are within limits. At least no 'steps' are counted during sleep, although I have a rather restless sleep. Running routes can only be detected and saved via the smartphone's GPS, as the watch itself does not have a GPS module. The battery lasts me about 2 weeks, even though a few dozen messages are displayed daily. But this can be freely configured in the app, which messages should be transmitted to the watch. And if the 'Do not disturb' option is active on the smartphone, nothing will be transmitted to the smartphone. The watch is not exactly cheap, but for the range of functions, it is a very good price! I would definitely recommend the watch if someone is not just looking for a pure sports watch.
May 23, 2021 | anonymous Highly recommended Thanks to the perfect EKG function, I was finally able to show my cardiologist my atrial fibrillation May 21, 2021 | anonymous Chic and good ???? A beautiful watch with the necessary functions ????. Yes, there may be people who are better off with Fitbit and Garmin, but this watch works with many apps and that's enough for me. The Fitbit watches don't tolerate sweating under the watch. I have two and the paint comes off both. And the Garmin Fenix is huge, has a bad band and is totally illogical to operate. Functionally powerful, but not really good. This one is simple, plain and looks good. Good for daily use ????.
May 21, 2021 | anonymous Only the most important Great watch, looks like one and not like others. All the functions we need are available May 21, 2021 | anonymous Long battery life The simple design and battery life that lasts up to three weeks on a full charge are recommended. However, there are limitations to the essential functions as a wearable device in the Japanese specification, and it feels less valuable compared to Apple Watch and other rival products.
May 18, 2021 | anonymous Attention the ECG (Electrocardiogram) is not accessible in Canada and USA! Attention the ECG (Electrocardiogram) is not accessible in Canada and USA! I am French in transit in Canada and I bought this watch for this main reason (ECG) and I noticed after 24 hours that the ECG could not provide any data, and that the option did not even appear on the watch screen, apparently due to North American legislation. I am currently exploring possibilities to overcome this incredible obstacle... or return the watch May 15, 2021 | anonymous top The watch looks great and the functions are easily accessible, everything is self-explanatory. The measurements - for me oxygen saturation during sleep - match the doctor's records! May 14, 2021 | anonymous Clear purchase recommendation Great fitness watch - EKG function works perfectly - in combination with the health app, the Scanwatch is a clear purchase recommendation May 13, 2021 | anonymous Analog dial and long battery life Analog dial May 12, 2021 | anonymous Great watch Great watch, used to have Fitbit. But this is by far the better option. Wish I would have bought this watch before.
May 12, 2021 | anonymous Clear design with easy-to-read LED I wish the electrocardiogram would respond faster. The design is simple and the texture is flawless. It's easy to hit when Ryu's wrist is bent, and before you know it, the workout has started. The battery is designed to be charged for about 20 days, but even when it reaches 2% remaining, it continues to function as a watch. The charging time is fast, so it's not stressful.
May 12, 2021 | anonymous Uhr Always happy to do it again!!! May 10, 2021 | anonymous Smartwatch with many functions, measurement results with limitations and all for 265 EUR Overall a good watch, but with limitations in the measurement results. I would have expected more at this price (265 EUR). Positive: + visually appealing + many measuring functions + Clever function when the hands are in the area of the display. Then they are moved downwards. + good hand correction when they are not congruent with the minute marks. + the support reacts quite quickly Negative: - With many measured values, there are occasional incorrect displays. This must then be interpreted accordingly, e.g. real wake phases are displayed as sleep. - The km/h display when cycling hardly works and if it does, the values are sometimes incorrect. According to support, this is due to the faulty connection to the Android app Health Mate. Km/h is usually not displayed there. Distance and speed are correct. Note: When measuring ECG and O2, you should only place your fingers so that the watch has full contact. Pressing too hard prevents measurement.
May 8, 2021 | anonymous Easy-to-read watch.
The watch display is easy to read and the battery charges quickly. The only downside is that there are few transfer displays. But I'm satisfied.
May 8, 2021 | anonymous App very well positioned, lots of info Super design, series bracelet caused allergic reaction for me. Pulse detection sometimes unclear. Sometimes shows 170, but only 94 when checked with stopwatch on wrist, difference unexplainable.
May 7, 2021 | anonymous Sleek Design I liked the design. The simple and sleek look is stylish. I wanted to do a health check because I got caught in the electrocardiogram item in the health examination, so I bought this. It would be nice if I could take an electrocardiogram, but it seems that it cannot be taken in the domestic version. I hope to be able to get approval in the future. So, for the time being, I plan to use other heart rate measurement and sleep monitoring functions. I would like to add a review on the functionality in the future, but for now, I just want to express my joy of getting it.
May 7, 2021 | anonymous prima Uhr Data is recognized well and securely May 5, 2021 | anonymous Beautiful smartwatch with good features The design is very appealing. The features are as described. A comparison of the measured values with other devices is consistent. Everyone should make their own assessment of the watch's navigation. The menu items are switched using the wheel on the watch.
May 5, 2021 | anonymous Klasse Very good, great menu and also visually looks like a watch.
May 4, 2021 | anonymous Awesome 👍 Fitness watch with style. Great battery life lasting weeks unlike smart watches from other major manufacturers that last a few days at best.
May 3, 2021 | anonymous The almost perfect fitness watch! Maybe it saved my life! More on that later. Those who expect the classic smartwatch will be bitterly disappointed here! There are no apps (how could there be without a proper display?), the messaging function is rather rudimentary. But those who are looking for a pure fitness watch will be thrilled. I had already tried several models from Samsung, Huawei and Amazfit (Xiaomi) before and was never really satisfied. Either the functions were okay, but the battery life was unacceptable. With the other models, this was correct, but the functions were either not available or only poorly implemented. Everything is right for me with this watch. It looks great, is of high quality, absolutely easy and comfortable to use. It offers almost all fitness functions that you need, in addition to an ECG, which detected signs of atrial fibrillation in me. A proper examination by the doctor confirmed the diagnosis and I now have to take blood thinners. A probable stroke could thus be avoided! Just great! The operation via the crown is very comfortable and easy. The battery lasts, depending on usage intensity, for about 10-20 days. The app offers everything you need, presented in a very clear and organized way. I immediately ordered the blood pressure monitor, which completes the health values. The body scale will also be added soon. I am absolutely convinced. For me, the perfect health tracker! May 3, 2021 | anonymous Uhr funktioniert gut ab Android 8, ohne Handy kann man sie nicht nutzen Meine 5 Sterne vergebe ich für die Uhr und die App Health Mate zusammen. Ohne die App kann man die Features der Uhr nicht nutzen. Für mich waren die EKG und VHF Funktionen wichtig, da ich in unregelmäßigen Anständen Herzstolpern habe. Das VHF konnte ich in der kurzen Zeit nicht testen, aber das 1-Kanal EKG Ist in Ordnung, wenn man nicht gerade den Arm auf den Laptop legt, dann ist es verrauscht, ebenso die O2-Messung. Dass von manchen die Etagenanzeige bemängelt wird, verstehe ich nicht. Wenn man wie beschrieben mit dem Auto oder Aufzug auf eine höhere Etage fährt, zeigt die Uhr natürlich nichts an, man muss schon hinauf laufen, auch den Berg hinauf, fahren kann jeder. Im Ernst, der Höhenmesser arbeitet nur wenn bergauf gleichzeitig Schritte festgestellt werden. Das Display ist schön hell und auch bei Sonne ablesbar. Der Verbrauch hält sich in Grenzen, ich schätze mal, bei normaler Anwendung kommt man ungefähr zwei Wochen damit aus. Nutz man keine Zusatzfunktionen, könnte der Akku auch bis zu 30 Tagen reichen. Es ist kein Problem, die Uhr ungefähr alle 2 Wochen auf die Ladestation zu legen, dann ist man immer auf der sicheren Seite.Zuletzt noch der Service: Will man eine Mail an den deutschen Kundendienst schreiben, wird man im voraus gewarnt, dass es länger dauert. Ich habe an den englischsprachigen Service geschrieben und schnelle Antworten bekommen. Ich hatte das Problem, dass die App immer abstürzte, weil ich Android 6 hatte. Der Service hat mir viele Ratschläge gegeben, aber nichts hat geholfen. Auf meinem Tablett mit Android 7 lief es problemlos, obwohl es offiziell erst ab 8 laufen soll. Jetzt habe ich ein neues Smartphone mit 10 und da ist alles o.k.Ich habe die Uhr jetzt 2 Wochen und werde meine Rezension nach längerer Zeit noch ergänzen, wenn ich mehr Erfahrung habe. Bis jetzt bin ich zufrieden um nicht zu sagen begeistert.
May 2, 2021 | anonymous Elegant, well-functioning hybrid watch Super comfortable watch! Beautiful watch with functions that are essential to me, while maintaining the classic look of a watch. High quality materials used in its construction. Great! May 2, 2021 | anonymous Withings ScanWatch Great design, good battery life...
May 1, 2021 | anonymous Alles super Alles super April 30, 2021 | anonymous Great watch for health-conscious people Overall a great watch that looks really good and works reliably. No frills, no elaborate functions. After 14 days, I had terrible problems with my skin, bought a new strap, but it didn't get better. Actually, I'm reacting to nickel lately, so I really have to part with the good piece with a heavy heart.
April 30, 2021 | anonymous Battery endurance very good Super battery April 28, 2021 | anonymous Expecting Japanese support.
I was relieved to find out that the time does not go wrong, as mentioned in other people's reviews. I also really like the design. However, it seems that the manual and notifications are not fully supported in Japanese. That is the biggest downside.
April 28, 2021 | anonymous Reliability super cool watch and functions are simply top!! ;.) no regrets about the purchase April 27, 2021 | anonymous Tip Top Better than Apple, interaction with Android or iOS apps.
April 26, 2021 | anonymous The best watch I've ever had! The Scanwatch is a great watch to track your health data with the Healthmate app. I previously had a Samsung smartwatch and a Fitbit. And I have to say, none of them can even come close to the Scanwatch from Withings! The Scanwatch is medically tested, in my opinion, it captures the data very accurately (all floors when climbing stairs are correct), the pulse is very accurate when I compare it to a blood pressure monitor, and otherwise the watch is unbeatable both in design and battery life, all at a fair price. If you're looking for a watch that you don't have to constantly charge, looks stylish, and above all is interested in monitoring your health data, this watch is perfect for you. Although I have an iPhone, I would never buy an Apple watch after this Scanwatch! In the health sector, Withings Scanwatch is unbeatable! April 25, 2021 | anonymous Battery life and new features It is good that the battery life is good. It may be better to measure the breathing irregularity more frequently.
April 22, 2021 | anonymous EKG Recording With EKG function, calorie counter, breathing, workout, oxygen saturation, floors, distance traveled, step count, heart rate monitor, watch, connected with Health Mate APP via Bluetooth.
April 21, 2021 | anonymous Heart monitoring The watch no longer charges, how can we handle the warranty case? Best regards, K. Rabener April 21, 2021 | anonymous Selection mistake I purchased it with the expectation of measuring blood pressure, but returned it because the product sold in Japan did not have the desired function.
April 20, 2021 | anonymous Very good fitness watch I am very satisfied with the Scanwatch so far. The health values are measured reliably (or at least I hope so) and transferred to the app. I haven't been able to test the measurement while swimming yet, due to lack of opportunity, but I assume that it will work very well too. I also have other devices from Withings and find that it saves me some trips to the doctor... I can recommend the watch with a clear conscience.
April 19, 2021 | anonymous Great smartwatch with classic elegance I've had the Scanwatch for more than 5 weeks now. My smartwatch was a Pebble-Steel smartwatch, which ensured a permanent display using E-Ink.I generally don't like smartwatches that have a dark 'dial' that doesn't show anything to save power (looks stupid and inelegant), and when needed, the 'dial' is lit up and can do similar things to a smartphone, just smaller. The battery life must not be less than 1 week. I don't find touchscreens comfortable on watches - rather annoying - that's what I have a smartphone for.Pebble was discontinued and there was no support, so I went looking for an alternative. I got the Withings Steel HR Sport because I like to run and record my heart rate.The look of the Withings Steel HR Sport is okay for a smartwatch, but it didn't really convince me. However, the pulse recording corresponds to that of my Garmin running watch.But since I like beautiful classic watches, I couldn't resist the Withings Scanwatch and treated myself to it for my birthday. A really good and beautiful smartwatch - I don't know of a more beautiful one. The functions heart rate, ECG, O2 measurement work well if you take your time and follow the instructions (ECG, O2: sit upright for 30 sec. and place the 2nd hand on the case). The sleep tracking also works well - how does the Apple Watch do that, it has to be charged during that time - LOL!!!The only disadvantage I noticed is that the heart rate measurement during running and jogging becomes very inaccurate (probably due to sweat?), about 15-20 beats higher than with the Garmin or Withings Steel HR Sport). As a result, my fitness level in the app has jumped from 46 to 44. It's a huge difference whether you have a heart rate of 140 or 160!Now I know that and use the Garmin again when I train - not a big deal for me.The watch is totally awesome with the crown (turning and pressing). The haptic feedback and the (response) feedback with the light vibration is really good. No comparison to the other smartwatches.The battery life with about 2-3 hours of jogging per week (permanent pulse recording) is about 3 weeks. If that's not done, it's probably 4-5 weeks.Oh, I'm talking about the 42mm version in black here.
April 18, 2021 | anonymous Absolutely worth your money Very reliable and worth your money. 1-channel ECG VF warning has already been confirmed for me in the hospital. The normal classic elegant watch design and yet the fitness tracker functions are available. I like that very much. As I said, it's a matter of taste.
April 18, 2021 | anonymous Good quality, app works smoothly, minor flaws I bought the ScanWatch 2 days ago to keep track of my steps during home office, as well as my sleep and sports activities. From the beginning, the watch made a very high-quality impression with the fabric bag for protection and the very well-made case. At first, I had considered the 38mm version because of my small wrist, but then decided on the 42mm version, which turned out to be a good decision because the watch is not too big. However, in my opinion, the silicone strap is somewhat uncomfortable, and for this price, a more comfortable option should have been included, hence one star deduction. Now let's talk about the app. Many of the reviews complain about bugs or connection problems. I can only say that setting up and explaining the watch worked as smoothly and easily as with no other product I have tested. The design of the app also corresponds exactly to my expectations because it is very clear and simple. A dark mode is also included. The pedometer is very good because it does not count excessively many steps like some other fitness watches. The heart rate monitor, ECG, and SPO2 monitor work perfectly and very accurately, and the advertising promises are kept. The workout function is okay, activities are recognized well, but the 5 selectable modes are simply not enough for someone who does a lot of sports. There is still potential for improvement here. Sleep tracking is my favorite feature of the watch because it has really brought me back to a more regular and restful sleep. The smart wake-up option has made it easier for me to get out of bed in the morning. Unfortunately, I have had several cases where the alarm simply did not work, which is really bad if you rely on it completely. A fix is urgently needed here. Notifications are not really important to me, they work, and that's enough for me. The route recording when jogging is somewhat inaccurate via the app, sometimes too short. Here I would recommend Strava, which worked better in this case. The 30-day battery life is, in my opinion, a pure marketing statement because all power-consuming options were turned off. In reality, my watch lasted for 5 days with daily workouts and running sessions as well as breathing scans at night on automatic, which I think is quite good. All in all, the watch has greatly improved my lifestyle, and I love its normal and inconspicuous design. Apart from a few minor problems, it is a top watch. 4/5 stars.
April 15, 2021 | anonymous Perfect for me! Easy installation, excellent features and great appearance! The free app is on the same level as the watch. I am very satisfied and can recommend the watch to everyone! April 14, 2021 | anonymous Very good functionalities and sporty-elegant design that can be read well I had ordered three watches from this manufacturer for selection and this one stayed with me because I could read it by far the best. With the other two models (Scanwatch 38mm, Steel HR), the contrast between the thin hands and the background is so low that, especially in low light, you can only guess what time it could be. In addition, the operation with the push-turn wheel of this model is much more intuitive and practical. Many of the health functions are probably gimmicks, because it would be amazing if a watch for just under €300 could create an ECG in 30 seconds, for which specialized medical technology is otherwise used. But the watch dutifully records steps, floors, heart rate, and sleep rhythms and also looks like a real, serious wristwatch.
April 13, 2021 | anonymous Sleep quality measurement The evaluation of sleep is not always compatible with actual sleep.
April 12, 2021 | anonymous Would recommend the watch to friends The quality is good and the packaging is appealing. I have various products from the manufacturer and am always impressed. When connected to the app (via BT), all data is recorded. Battery life is as stated. As long as you don't constantly measure your oxygen saturation and take an EKG - which I did extremely frequently at the beginning :_) April 8, 2021 | anonymous A great, elegant smartwatch I bought the smartwatch mainly for monitoring sleep apnea. Had some problems with it years ago. I am absolutely satisfied! The watch looks elegant, many do not even recognize at first glance that it is a smartwatch. I also think it's great that the percentage of my daily goal is displayed in the lower part of the watch. So I don't always have to call up the app or the otherwise hidden display field. The battery has lasted me at least 2 weeks so far, usually even longer. I would only wish for the display of seconds on the screen. The installation with the app went absolutely smoothly. I am thrilled and would buy the watch again at any time.
April 8, 2021 | anonymous Very good product I have an Apple smartwatch and in comparison, I have to say that I like this watch better. It looks good, the functions are very good and reliable. The price is great.
April 7, 2021 | anonymous Rewarding Purchase Stylish watch that still fulfills the desired functions perfectly.
April 7, 2021 | anonymous Great design with weaknesses in activity tracking The watch is generally very good, looks great and has a long battery life. However, it frequently fails to recognize activities correctly. For example, it detects cycling several times a day, even though I don't own a bike and am actually sitting or walking at my desk. It would be desirable to be able to exclude individual activities from automatic detection. The health features, such as heart rate monitor and sleep tracking, are excellent though.
April 7, 2021 | anonymous Battery life...Dial The watch lives up to its promise...super battery life...always super readable dial April 5, 2021 | anonymous Simply great ???????? Great watch, excellent app, replaced the predecessor Steel HR Sport with it, new features, the watch is first-class April 5, 2021 | anonymous Beautiful, very functional, excellent battery After using the Scanwatch for about a month, I can say that I am thrilled. I bought it because I wanted to track my heart rate for 24 hours, even at night and not just during exercise. The indication that the product is clinically validated, combined with relevant information on the manufacturer's website, convinced me. Unlike the usual fitness bracelets with touch screens (which often get stuck over time), the operation of the watch with the analog crown is optimally solved, the menu navigation is also very direct, and you quickly get where you want to go. The battery life is also excellent, currently the charge lasts about a week for me. And last but not least: the watch also looks very chic, it can also pass as a 'normal' watch and is not as thick as other smartwatches. So I can highly recommend it! April 4, 2021 | anonymous Thoughtful design Replaced my Fitbit Charge 4. Great design, EKG function and part of the Withings health tools. Especially recommended is the additional blood pressure monitor.
April 2, 2021 | anonymous Withings Scanwatch in Black for him and her We both had the Steel HR Sport sessions before. Therefore, we are familiar with the app and the watches. We were attracted by the additional features, so we ordered both watches with a black dial in 38 and 42mm. Delivery via Amazon to my wife was as usual fast and correct. In my case, a 'stripped-down' version arrived without the correct packaging, without accessories, and instead of 42mm only 38mm. So, I complained, returned it, reordered, and then the correct one arrived. Someone must have made a mistake in the warehouse. It happens, and it was processed without any problems. So, about the watches. Setup was easy, the apps took the watches without any problems, and normal setup on the watches. Fits. The watches charged, still with metal bracelets, protective films for the glass on, and worn. What can I say: everything runs smoothly, no quirks. The battery life is not quite as long as the Steel HR, but so far definitely over 14 days, rather 3 weeks for both. So, we are very satisfied with the increased range of functions. Not annoying to recharge every day. Overall, the values such as steps, floors, pulse values, O2, appear to be quite accurate. It recognizes cycling from time to time, even if you are not cycling. But it recognizes when you are really cycling, which is safer. We both perceive the rotary knob as an advantage, the menus are easier to use. The slightly larger display is easier to read. Overall, the watches are slightly larger than their predecessors. But in our opinion, they look even more valuable and are not overloaded with bling-bling, but look like a normal watch. They can be worn for all occasions, and the functions are not noticeable. We both like that. We don't have any criticisms for now. App: We know those from Samsung, Garmin, Fitbit, and Withings. Well, everyone has their advantages and disadvantages. We can handle it well, picking the best from all is not possible, and you absolutely cannot say that it is unusable. It has also been continuously developed during the entire time, which we also find very positive. The range of functions is also good for our purposes and demands, we are normal users. Overall, we are very satisfied with what is offered and enjoy wearing the watches.
April 2, 2021 | anonymous Good construction good features Serious design and smart features April 2, 2021 | anonymous Advanced watch with powerful software in the background This is the most advanced watch I have ever worn, after a Wear OS watch and a Fossil hybrid watch. A lot has already been said about the watch itself, so I will write about the software app, which is often neglected by many manufacturers. For me, this is the core of this watch and is what makes the enormous added value, even compared to Google Fit. The values are immediately related to each other and placed in a causal and easily understandable context. There are tips to improve certain indicators and you can always delve deeper into the various features. The texts are scientifically based. The whole software makes a much more serious impression on me than Google Fit and is very well thought out. Just the fact that I can write individual notes to the values makes total sense, to get to the bottom of a bad sleep for example. My absolute recommendation is to try out this watch for at least a week ;) April 2, 2021 | anonymous Just a tiny catch The watch is stylish, has a long battery life depending on usage, and provides great measurement results (which I cross-checked with additional devices). The watch does not receive a clear recommendation. The only small catch is the slightly too sensitive crown. When I bend my wrist, I regularly hit it and the watch clicks through the menu.
March 31, 2021 | anonymous Nice watch but... not yet mature Scan Watch (black) looks good and works except for three things, which unfortunately are very decisive. 1.) -the contact from the watch to the phone is often lost and then has to be reconnected with the start of the app. Thus, no incoming messages come to the watch. That's not acceptable... 2.) -when I do intensive sports, the pulse shows me from 46 to 168! This happens within a few seconds or the watch does not show any pulse and searches for the pulse to be recorded. My resting pulse is 58! How can the pulse be below my resting pulse during intense exertion? ... and please don't tell me that I didn't wear the watch correctly or not tight enough or with the wrong bracelet (metal or rubber, etc.) I tested everything almost daily for 5 weeks and informed myself. The watch measures excellently at rest. Sometimes I am monitored by devices that measure pulse, blood pressure, and SPO2 at the doctor's office. Even during a walk, the measured pulse range is between 54 and an incredible 168! Tracking recording only works approximately, as the watch sometimes does not record anything. 3. - SPO2 measures inaccurately, always between 95 and 97% (even at night). At the doctor's office at the same time, it is 98-100%. Conclusion: Nice watch but still needs some updates. Then there will be 5 stars.
March 30, 2021 | anonymous Battery lasts 2 weeks I wanted a smartwatch that monitors my health and not a smartwatch with which I can make phone calls or exchange messages. What bothered me the most about many smartwatches was the low battery performance, max 1-3 days. After long research, I came across this watch. The manufacturer promises that the battery would last 4 weeks. It doesn't quite manage that ;-) . I not only have my sleep evaluated at night, but also the oxygen saturation in my blood, which the watch does every 30 minutes. I assume that's why the watch's battery only lasts 2 weeks. But that's still a good value. I use almost all the watch's features such as ECG, sleep analysis, measurement of oxygen content in the blood, motion detection, pulse detection and much more. Where there is light, there is also shadow. The app for the watch offers various workouts that can then be activated on the watch, such as swimming. However, swimming with the watch is not possible according to the watch's technical data (waterproof up to 50 m), which corresponds to the designation 5 ATM. I preferred not to try it. Summary assessment After a usage time of about 6 weeks, I can recommend it with a clear conscience and therefore give the maximum number of stars.
March 29, 2021 | anonymous Great product Super watch with great features. Suggestions for improvement are gladly accepted and incorporated by the manufacturer. A smartwatch with a digital dial did not appeal to me, so I chose this one and am completely satisfied. Looks great, battery lasts almost 1 week (with all measurements and such active). The accompanying app is also great and easy to use.
March 28, 2021 | anonymous Bought on Amazon UK, and now it can be used for SPO2 and ECG As the title suggests, I bought it on Amazon UK in late October 2020, with rumors that it could be used for SPO2 and ECG functions. I received it and started using it with the Healthmate app from Google Play Store without thinking much about it. Unfortunately, the SPO2 and ECG functions did not activate, and I left it almost unused in disappointment. When I looked it up, I regretted that I could have made it work by doing this and that... However, I started using it around March this year, and when I casually turned the crown, the SPO2 and ECG functions became active! I don't know why, but the battery life is good, and I use it comfortably every day.
March 28, 2021 | anonymous Superproduct High-quality processed health watch. ECG function reliable. Only the rubber strap I don't find so great in view of the price....
March 27, 2021 | anonymous Sleek Elegance Smartwatch with a focus on health functions. Excellently crafted, great app. But if you're looking for more bling, this is not the right choice! March 27, 2021 | anonymous Initial setup was a bit difficult The description of the reset procedure was unclear, so I had to reset it to correct my mistake. However, it has been working fine since I set it up. It accurately tracks my sleep, steps, and other health data. I compared the heart rate with other blood pressure monitors, and it seems to be mostly accurate.
March 27, 2021 | anonymous Stylish watch with great extras The battery lasts long, the different functions are precise.
March 26, 2021 | anonymous Can be charged via USB approximately every 30 days A very good watch for men. Many functions, good appearance and comfortable to wear. It is advisable to buy a protective film against scratches so that you can enjoy this watch for longer.
March 25, 2021 | anonymous Everything works well.
Everything is perfect! March 23, 2021 | anonymous Elegant precision measuring device Delivery was made in half the time announced, from Germany to Canada! Environmentally friendly packaging made of recyclable material, simple and elegant. Start-up instructions are a bit thin, without prior study of the manufacturer's website everything would have taken a little more time. The watch feels very solid, the clear design reminds one a bit of a glassworks. My wife was surprised, 'oh it looks elegant'. She was probably expecting one of those icon-laden fitness trackers. The dial is clear, unfortunately there is no second hand on the dial. This causes a two-minute measurement uncertainty of the display. 59 seconds before the minute hand changes again, 59 seconds after the hand changes position. In times of GPS, time displays with +- 0.1 second accuracy, this is a slow value for a 290 euro watch. On the other hand: Let's be honest, who on this planet needs second-accurate resolution when we can assume that ten people coming to a meeting have up to two minutes total deviation on their watches? The supplied silicone strap is supple, long enough to cope with strong wrists. The watch functions are limited to the necessary, hour, minute. A press on the easy-to-use crown displays time and date on the high-contrast display. Then an app must be installed, without which it is not possible. The watch and app then run their updates as expected. Afterwards, everyone has to wade through the settings, the manufacturer's app is very helpful and clear. The supplied charging adapter requires a 5V 500 mA power supply, the watch went from 30% to 100% charging capacity in less than an hour. The pulse measurement is accurate within +-3 beats compared to a commercial pulse meter. The blood oxygen sensor is similar +- 3% to medical measuring devices. After initial estimates, I would estimate the deviation of the accuracy of the watch sensors to be < 5% of medical measuring devices. Pretty good. I am a 50-year-old man with weight problems and the suspicion that my heart will soon need the attention of a doctor. The Scanwatch is supposed to give me an impression that I can trust. Together with a scale and a blood pressure monitor, I now want to start learning a little more about my body. I am not a fitness professional who wants to know every mole of blood sugar. I want to improve my overall condition and reliably measure core values. It seems that this watch will be a good part of the process.
March 21, 2021 | anonymous Withinks unisex Smartwatch The watch was delivered quickly as expected. The battery lasts for about 3 weeks with my usage. The app is good and displays everything quite clearly. It has a comfortable wearing feel. All in all, a nice watch with the background of a smartwatch.
March 21, 2021 | anonymous Definitely recommendable The Withings smartwatch was a great purchase. I am very satisfied, especially with the mobile app. You have to read up on it well to understand the versatility of this watch. It can do so much and the battery lasts extremely long, so I only charge it about once a month and that's it. I can only recommend it. :) March 21, 2021 | anonymous Elegant Watch Looks really elegant, not as flashy as some other competitors. A really long battery life, over a week. Works really reliably. I can't fully trust the sleep monitoring display, as it doesn't match how I feel. The introduction to the operation was good, it's really intuitive.
March 20, 2021 | anonymous Best Activity Tracker Watch Hybrid The watch is the perfect combination for me between an activity tracker and a watch. No unnecessary bells and whistles that only drain the battery. The battery life is at least two weeks for me (daily 1x sports tracking and pulse measurement every night), which is really good. The activity tracking works flawlessly. The watch tracks steps as well as pulse and a connected smartphone, if necessary (via GPS) the exact route. The app synchronizes all activities and saves them. You can also link various apps to track weight or eating behavior. The ECG and oxygen saturation measurement functions are even clinically tested and their accuracy confirmed. I particularly like the alarm function, where you can select a time and a time range before it, and the watch wakes you up at a suitable (but no later than the selected) time when you are in the light sleep phase. This way, you wake up much more refreshed. I only miss a few alternative sports to track, such as inline skating.
March 20, 2021 | anonymous Watch The watch is worn and used. Great item.
March 19, 2021 | anonymous Very accurate measuring scales and easy handling App excellent The product is excellent long battery life looks discreet March 19, 2021 | anonymous perfekt for me, this watch is perfect - I actually only need it for medical reasons - very easy to use and looks very good.
March 19, 2021 | anonymous Withings watch with EKG The first two weeks we were very satisfied with the watch and its functions. Then unfortunately it became defective and was sent back. The adjustment knob was stuck and therefore it was no longer possible to adjust.
March 17, 2021 | anonymous Keeping me up to date on my health A perfect article to recommend now March 16, 2021 | anonymous What I wanted - a health watch! Although I am a big 'Apple' fan and otherwise equipped accordingly, I consciously did not want a smartwatch from this company. I wanted a watch that looks like a watch, which primarily provides me with information about my health, so not a fitness watch, but a health watch. And that's exactly what the Scanwatch is - for me, what I wanted - with breathing monitoring during sleep, heart rate measurement, blood oxygen measurement, ECG recording and, most importantly, the detection of atrial fibrillation. The fact that the watch also offers fitness functions and records everything important is also useful for sports enthusiasts. In this respect, it offers what the other smartwatches also offer, only more in terms of health, but you cannot make phone calls or listen to music with the watch. But that's what I have my smartphone for. The operation via the watch crown is a bit unusual, but I quickly got used to it. I have not regretted the purchase decision! The price-performance ratio is also okay in my opinion! I cannot write anything about the customer service - I have not had to use it yet. The PDF user manual has helped me with any questions so far.
March 15, 2021 | anonymous Highly recommended the battery life is outstanding: estimated 14 days with many notifications. The app is very detailed, waterproofing is not a given in this price range (see Skagen Jorn). The processing is very good. I have also had a Fossil and a Samsung Galaxy Smartwatch.
March 14, 2021 | anonymous Great Watch Beautiful watch inconspicuous, elegant and with good health functions. Great product March 13, 2021 | anonymous Analog watch with mini screen Hello, the watch itself works great, but it needs to be connected to the phone. When setting up with the app, the watch needs to be reconnected several times, but that's not the watch's fault. Once when starting the app and again after registering!? The analog hands always display the time, and pressing the crown activates the small screen. If the hands are in the way, they jump to 10 past 10. Synchronization apparently works without having to open the app, I've seen much worse. Or there was simply nothing to sync! An EKG and/or oxygen saturation measurement is started by pressing and turning the crown and by placing the second hand on the case, which takes a little practice. On the phone, you can see the EKG in real-time. You can even recognize different people (yes, I know, the watch is for one person). The screen is small, but you can see the most important things. Through the app, you can suppress the displayed values and change the order. Regards, Roland March 13, 2021 | anonymous Elegant and Technically Revolutionary The Scanwatch lives up to its promises and was also reviewed by a cardiologist friend, who took the results seriously and explained them... which means that a doctor can definitely work with them and build on them. The pedometer is accurate, the design of the hybrid watch is elegant and simple. The watch is very comfortable to wear and the strap is easily interchangeable. The battery was last charged (and for the first time) a month ago and still holds up.
March 13, 2021 | anonymous No EKG and SPO2, as not approved in the EU I ordered the watch in Germany via Amazon. It did not show any EKG or SPO2 measurement. I thought it would come through the app. However, the EKG button could not be activated either. I immediately contacted support and received feedback after 4 days that this watch is not approved for sale in the EU but actually for international shipping. Therefore, the EKG and SPO2 option is not available. Since this was exactly the reason for the order, I will of course send it back. Very unfortunate as I would have liked the watch and the app. The floor recognition is not correct and the step count is also rather approximate... so be sure to check if the functions are displayed!! March 13, 2021 | anonymous Works clearly Good watch, both visually and in handling. Long battery life March 12, 2021 | anonymous High-quality This is an almost perfect solution if you are looking for a smartwatch that focuses on health functions and has a long battery life. For people who need colorful images on their watch and are primarily looking for another smartphone on their wrist, this watch is rather unsuitable. Because this watch has both hands and would pass as a normal watch at first glance, you can read the time with a sideways glance in between. If it is dark once, a press on the crown (it is acknowledged with a short vibration: cool) and the very sharp black and white display shows the time and date in a crisp manner. Definitely good for people with poor eyesight. The functions of the watch are executed flawlessly and quite accurately. Everything is kept simple and clear. When one of the hands is in the display, the minute hand automatically moves to the 10 o'clock position and the hour hand to the 2 o'clock position. The design is so noble and elegant that you like to look at it. The glass seems to be resistant. When turning the crown, you navigate through the menu. Each menu item is acknowledged with a short vibration, which gives the whole thing a high-quality impression. The weight feels like that of a normal watch. It does not disturb when sleeping. In contrast to a rather sporty smartwatch, this watch also goes well with a suit. The app shows everything you need and more. I can no longer believe the bad reviews here. The battery lasts at least 23 days, even with extensive use and on the very first charge. I think it's a rumor that you can get this watch to zero in just 3 days. If you want to do yourself a favor, you should treat yourself to this watch.
March 11, 2021 | anonymous Uhr ist einfach gut Great smartwatch, pleasant battery life, comfortable to wear, only downside is the wristband, replacement wristband is recommended March 10, 2021 | anonymous Disappointed Magnificent connected watch, but not finished! I will come back when the software is ready.
March 10, 2021 | anonymous Worth the money and stylish Very happy with this purchase as I always found most smart watches to be ugly. This one is very stylish and as such can be worn to any event. The design is very simple and straight to the point. The app needs about of cleaning up but again very simple to read. It was interesting to see how many times a night and the health insights you get every day are a great little extra. The only issue I have is how the watch mesures blood oxygen as I did not realize that Tatoo’s would affect the reading as such I need to move it where I don’t have any. It would of been good to know this at the start but also my fault for not doing more research March 10, 2021 | anonymous Very nice watch! Unfortunately, the blood oxygen measurement did not work properly on mine. I sent it back.
March 9, 2021 | anonymous Top I like everything about the watch. It looks good. It is functional and the app provides good information.
March 8, 2021 | anonymous Smart-Watch Optically and haptically a very nice watch, clean and neatly processed. Battery life for a smartwatch is brilliant, 10 days of continuous operation with regular function usage is not a problem and there is still charge available. Sensors for pulse and SPO2 require a very tight fit on the wrist, otherwise the values are not correct and too low. Overall, a very good product, for me the 2nd generation of Withings that I have purchased and a clear recommendation.
March 7, 2021 | anonymous Recommended Measurements and subsequent detailed checks via smartphone/app work well. The sleep recordings are very detailed. Sleep duration, deep sleep phases, sleep interruptions, overall evaluation in %. Timer function not used so far.
March 7, 2021 | anonymous Great Watch To keep it short, looks good, works perfectly, great battery life, simply a very good smartwatch in a classic design.
March 5, 2021 | anonymous Withings All good March 5, 2021 | anonymous Super Watch Easy to install and the better I-WATCH March 4, 2021 | anonymous Motivation Runs smoothly and motivates me to do more sports and see progress. Too bad it can't measure blood pressure, that's missing.
March 3, 2021 | anonymous Great product I have the watch and the balance with the app its great to track my progress would buy again without hesitating March 1, 2021 | anonymous Great watch It was a gift for my husband. He is thrilled. Great quality, fast delivery.
February 26, 2021 | anonymous Motivating for more health.
Very good watch. In addition to the measurements, a lot of information is provided on health issues. I can only recommend the purchase.
February 25, 2021 | anonymous Nice watch but unfortunately unusable. Update, problem solved.
Actually a very nice watch. All measurements also work perfectly. My main problem, however, are the notifications. The watch only responds to them when I have unlocked my phone. This makes it unusable for me. I hope there will be a firmware update for this, because otherwise it is actually great. Update from 24.02.2021 After a long time of trying and testing different settings, I found the solution to the problem of notifications not being transmitted. Activating the Always on Display brought the desired result. Now the notifications are also transmitted to the watch when the smartphone display is turned off. (Huawei P30 Pro) February 22, 2021 | anonymous Functional watch I am very satisfied. Great handling February 22, 2021 | anonymous Somewhat expensive but does what it should Slim elegant watch which in my opinion is a bit too expensive. However, it does exactly what it should and works perfectly.
February 21, 2021 | anonymous 5 stars for design and battery It's not just a small computer on your wrist, it's still a watch - with the time always readable. With the typical arm movement when reading the time, you can also turn on the small display. This is very practical in the dark. + The small display lasts about 2 weeks. The ECG function is quite interesting, as it actually measures electrically (you also have to place your right hand on the metallic watch frame and wait 30 seconds). Note: The pulse waveform displayed on the small display is fake (always looks the same). It wasn't until I looked at my data on the internet that I saw the measured waveforms. These are probably partially distorted. What can be concluded from this is another matter, but changes or abnormalities in pulse rate can perhaps be detected. It always says 'ok' if no atrial fibrillation is detected (which of course cannot be tested whether it really works).
February 21, 2021 | anonymous Seller gets the grade easier SUPER It is exactly as described Really and 100% ???????????????????????????????? Two minus points for me are, No light for the night to see what time it is and the second point, one cannot measure blood pressure! Otherwise, a quite noble watch.
February 20, 2021 | anonymous No BPM function, but otherwise great It just works well. The values are comparable to my other devices that I used for testing (plus or minus 10%). Battery lasts a long time and sync works perfectly. And it looks like a watch, not like a multifunctional device like others. Very satisfied. I would only wish for a blood pressure measurement function (BPM) - but maybe it will come.
February 20, 2021 | anonymous Nice design, partially very accurate, but inaccurate for certain measurements.
Unfortunately, it recognizes sports that I did not perform. Example: I was working with a chainsaw, the Withings recognized cycling. It does not always recognize floors. Very positive is that the ECG is very accurate. A reference measurement with my general practitioner showed no deviation. Body temperature would still be fantastic.
February 20, 2021 | anonymous Good value for money Battery lasts incredibly long February 20, 2021 | anonymous Sleek and Enduring The watch lives up to its promise. + Design + Battery life (10-14 days) + Quality + App functionality + Accuracy +/- The sleep monitoring works reliably at the beginning and end. Details are insufficiently recorded in my experience. I woke up after a nightmare (my wife stole my chocolate :) and couldn't fall asleep for a long time. The app did not measure any unusual values. In addition, I would buy it again and recommend it without hesitation.
February 19, 2021 | anonymous Connected Health Devices I bought this watch after trying Huawei, Samsung, etc. Since I have a heart condition, I was looking for a smartwatch that records heart rate (24/7 pulse), oxygen saturation, and EKG. It's nice that it also logs steps and even routes. So, to summarize: heart rate every 10 minutes, automatic oxygen saturation at night, heart rate; during training (all types such as cross trainers, etc. adjustable) it records, EKG check if desired. For me, one of the best and easiest to use (EU certified!!) smartwatches. And it's also beautiful. In combination with the scale and the app, it's a great thing. It would be nice if the data could be imported into Excel.
February 19, 2021 | anonymous Great Watch The watch looks good. I wear it all day. The measurements are good in my opinion. I had a problem with the EKG. I needed many measurements to get a result. The problem was dry skin. Slightly moistening the finger solved the problem. The battery life of the watch is very good. I am very satisfied and can recommend it.
February 18, 2021 | anonymous Absolutely recommended!???? A great battery life, many useful features.
February 18, 2021 | anonymous Simply super and elegant Came neatly packaged, very easy installation and the app works great, everything the watch should do works great.
February 17, 2021 | anonymous Health indicators The ECG and blood oxygen function is very good. The sleep quality indicator is good.
February 17, 2021 | anonymous Scan watch So far we have noticed small differences in step counts. We are monitoring it.
February 16, 2021 | anonymous Good functionality First and foremost, the appearance and the 'watch' function are important to me. In addition, the Scanwatch determines and evaluates various body functions, the evaluations of which are quite suitable for training and improving one's fitness level.
February 16, 2021 | anonymous Scan Watch Great watch with amazing features, comfortable to wear and helpful in everyday life to achieve desired goals February 13, 2021 | anonymous Super Watch Very nice smartwatch. Classic design with many features such as oxygen saturation, pulse, ECG. Battery lasts very long (up to 30 days).
February 12, 2021 | anonymous A great thing I'm really excited. After three days of use, I now have enough insight into the capabilities of the ScanWatch. The installation is easy, the operation is practical, and the results are convincing. In addition to the great design, the well-thought-out concept and execution are simply convincing. An example: The window for the programs is located at the top in the middle. If it were, for example, just around 11:10 a.m., the hands would cover the program window and it would be difficult to read the data there. Nothing doing, if you want to read data at this time, the hands fold away and you have a completely free window. Once you have read it, they fold back automatically. Great.
February 10, 2021 | anonymous Withings Unisex-Adult Scanwatch I am very satisfied with this watch; I should have taken 38mm for my wrist, but otherwise great February 10, 2021 | anonymous Great reliable product The Scanwatch detected atrial fibrillation through EKG, immediate doctor's visit - the general practitioner confirmed it directly and action could be taken immediately. The cardiologist is also impressed with the watch. It should be subsidized by health insurance! February 10, 2021 | anonymous ECG in CANADA If you want to have ECG in canada Even if Health Canada has not approved (Stone age health Canada) you buy the watch in France and it works perfectly for all features including ECGYvon February 10, 2021 | anonymous Satisfied Dial needs to be corrected frequently.
February 9, 2021 | anonymous Very elegant with great features Great watch, just the right one. Highly recommended for people who value elegance and functionality.
February 9, 2021 | anonymous Detecting atrial fibrillation The watch looks much better than an Apple Watch and the ECG and blood oxygen measurement is simply ingenious. I would have chosen the smaller watch, but unfortunately the smaller watch does not have a red activity tracker. I miss the golf courses on the watch.
February 8, 2021 | anonymous Eczema caused by bracelet The bracelet has caused an itchy skin rash.
February 8, 2021 | anonymous Super Smart Watch Would always prefer this smart watch over an Apple Watch! I once had the Apple Watch 5 which I had to charge every day and it annoyed me extremely!! The watch can do almost everything the Apple can do, but has a battery life of over two weeks for me, since I also do sports twice a week and let it run accordingly! If you don't need a watch that can be equipped with all kinds of apps, the Withings is super satisfied! February 7, 2021 | anonymous Changed from Apple Watch I used to use the newly released Apple Watch. I chose this watch mainly for its appearance, notification function, and battery life, and I think I made a very good purchase. The following is just my personal opinion. Appearance: I was looking for a smartwatch with a watch type because the square screen doesn't fit well in a business scene. The appearance is very good and I like it very much, and it is the best evaluation point. Battery: I charge it for about 30 minutes when I take a bath, but the battery does not decrease even after a day. The catalog value is 30 days. I don't need to bring a battery when I travel, which is very helpful. No need to worry at all. Measurement content: By linking with the app, sleep status, pedometer, heart rate, etc. are measured. Progress is shown on the round dial under the watch. I set a goal of 7,000 steps per day. When I achieve it, I go around once. When I take a nap, the sleep status is not measured. When I wake up in the morning and stop the alarm and go to sleep immediately, I am awake, but it is counted as sleep. I thought that Apple Watch was more accurate in this regard. Sometimes the heart rate is very high or low, but I don't care because I think the fit is bad. Blood oxygen measurement seems to be equipped as a function, but it cannot be measured because it has not been approved in Japan. I just have to wait for approval. If I can measure it, I can see the apnea status during sleep. I'm looking forward to it. Watch notification: When a call, email, or line comes in, it notifies the title on the round screen at the top of the watch with a slight vibration. The vibration is a slight vibration that is not noticed at first (compared to Apple Watch). However, I got used to it and now I can feel the vibration. Many people don't notice this slight vibration, but I also use it as an alarm. Concerns: I always wear it except when taking a bath, but once I noticed that the watch hands were about 5 minutes ahead. I corrected it, but do I have to correct it regularly? There was such a thing once. That's all, I hope it helps.
February 6, 2021 | anonymous Completely satisfied The only downside is the sleep tracking function. The short nap in the afternoon is not recorded and sometimes the watch oversleeps the end of the night's sleep. I am awake and already have steps on my account at a time when the watch thinks I am still asleep. Those who consider this function very important will not be satisfied.
February 5, 2021 | anonymous The Scanwatch has a great app on the phone in addition to the watch functions...
Years ago I had a fitness tracker from the same provider - the watch has become worlds better now. And I love that I can also use it as a normal watch (dial). I am totally satisfied, I hope the battery lasts a long time.
February 3, 2021 | anonymous Top device can do everything February 3, 2021 | anonymous Super Watch Beautiful design, great features, long battery life February 3, 2021 | anonymous A real improvement over the Steel HR I've had the Withings Scanwatch for about a week now and would like to share my experiences here. I previously had the Withings (then still owned by Nokia) Steel HR. The Scanwatch is a true advancement, as it now not only measures heartbeats, but also allows for the creation of a medically accurate ECG with the Scanwatch. In addition, oxygen saturation can be measured at the touch of a button. The pedometer is of course back on board, and it is much more accurate than the Steel HR's. This was always a point of criticism, that the Steel HR's step counting was not accurate. With the update, this error has now been corrected, which is great, but also to be expected at a price of just under 300€. The measurement of heartbeats was already very accurate with the Steel HR, and when comparing the two watches on the same wrist and at the same time, no difference was observed. An ECG can now be made at the touch of a button, simply select it in the settings (turn the crown to the ECG menu item) and press firmly. The measurement starts immediately, which is very accurate for me (comparison with Omron blood pressure monitor). It is important to sit quietly, place your hand on a flat surface and press it firmly against the inside of your hand. Speaking should also be avoided during the measurement, which takes about 30 seconds. This procedure should also be followed when measuring oxygen saturation, although here, unlike with the ECG, sometimes two attempts are necessary. I cannot understand the criticism that only 'normal' is displayed after measuring. For detailed ECG, simply open the Healthmate app, where the exact measurement is located. The app collects all possible data recorded by Withings devices, from weight to blood pressure, heartbeats, etc. This should be clear when choosing a device that is controlled by an app, which is no different from Apple, Xiaomi, Amazfit, etc. Back to the Scanwatch, the quality is great, the noble sapphire glass prevents scratches, the weight is higher than with ordinary smartwatches (although smartwatch only applies to a limited extent), but this is no longer noticeable after a few days. The Scanwatch is not a classic smartwatch, but a hybrid watch with high-quality health functions. If you are looking for a smartwatch, for example to control your phone, read and answer SMS, you should not choose the Scanwatch. It was important to me that the watch is made in Europe, I do not want to provide my health data to any random company. The battery life is also to be positively evaluated, with one charge lasting up to 4 weeks with daily training of around 40-60 minutes. Unfortunately, there is no GPS integrated in the watch, so a phone and Bluetooth connection are mandatory if you want to track your distance covered. It would also have been nice to have a function to turn off Bluetooth during the night, perhaps this can be added later via an update. All in all, I can only recommend the Scanwatch, the design is of very high quality, the measurements are very precise and informative. The fact that the data is stored with a European company (France) is also a plus for me. If you liked my review, I would be very happy about a thumbs up :) February 2, 2021 | anonymous Withings The watch was a gift for my daughter. She is very satisfied. Above all, the battery life is unbeatable. What was less well received was the bracelet. However, there are alternatives in the accessories.
February 1, 2021 | anonymous Quickly installed - Recommendation for purchase if you want to support your treating cardiologist I'm not a tech hero, but I was able to quickly and successfully set up all functions - I'm currently 100 percent satisfied January 31, 2021 | anonymous Good quality, meets expectations.
The battery life is indicated to be 30 days with a full charge, my Scanwatch can manage a maximum of 21 days.
January 30, 2021 | anonymous Heart rate sensor synchronization with the app took a very long time.
January 30, 2021 | anonymous Finally a tracker that looks like a watch I bought this because it looked like a real watch and the reviews were pretty positive, including a very detailed and almost nerdy one on You Tube. As I’m 60 I found It’s very comforting to track one’s heart beat, sleep patterns and to do an ECG. I also love the small screen that alerts you to a text or a call and even displays the whole text for you ( one line at s time) I shoes thought this was a gimic but, when your phone is in your pocket or you are away from your phone or in s meeting, a small twist of your wrist and voila you can see who it’s from or the message. The healthmate app is ok but I would like to view it on my iPhone and iPad, which seemingly you can’t do. Either you can’t or I haven’t figured it out yet! All in all I’m very pleased with it and it sits very comfortably on one’s wrist.
January 30, 2021 | anonymous Great watch The watch lives up to its promises January 29, 2021 | anonymous Watch brings a lot of joy Sometimes missing hours in sleep quality. Although I slept from 11:00 pm to 7:00 am, it only shows until 3:00 am.
January 29, 2021 | anonymous Great watch with some flaws Relatively heavy. Bracelet too long. Health app drains the battery. Sleep app inaccurate. Those were the negative aspects. The rest is great. Would buy the watch again anytime.
January 28, 2021 | anonymous Works great Very good product. High-quality and comfortable to wear. Setup works smoothly thanks to very good user guidance. Data is reliably recorded. Practically intuitive to use. The app is clear. I would buy it again at any time.
January 26, 2021 | anonymous Smart Watch in edelem Design Doesn't look like a smart watch. The battery lasts at least 2 weeks. Very good features.
January 26, 2021 | anonymous Super Watch For monitoring blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen, etc.
January 25, 2021 | anonymous Very suitable for health tracking, long battery life of 30 days This watch feels very valuable. All functions work as indicated. The coordination between the watch and the app is very well done. Very comprehensive descriptions. Devices from other manufacturers are also recognized by the app. The battery life is really excellent. I can only recommend this tracking & health watch. Very good performance and reasonable price.
January 25, 2021 | anonymous Very good value for money Great design, easy handling of the watch and the app January 25, 2021 | anonymous Great watch, but after half a year there was a problem with operating the watch with the crown I'm a big fan of this watch, a very good mix between a watch with a more traditional pointer display and a smartwatch. I think the manufacturers have done a good job and the watch, together with the app, can do a lot. Since we liked the watch so much, my wife bought the watch first and then I bought it half a year later. After my wife bought the watch, there were problems operating the watch with the crown after half a year, individual points could no longer be selected via the crown. Fortunately, the watch was replaced by Amazon and my wife did not have any more problems. Surprisingly, I had similar problems with my watch, which I bought half a year later. After using it for half a year, there were also problems with operating the crown, certain points could not be selected with the crown. Surprisingly, the problems only occur in the workout menu item for me. After selecting 'Walk', the workout cannot be started via the crown. So I'm not sure if my problem is a mechanical problem or a software problem. This suggests that it is a general problem with the watch. I hope that the manufacturer has now solved the crown problem. Apart from this problem, I think the watch is great.
January 24, 2021 | anonymous Elegance and superior functionality in one Perfect in terms of possibilities - even measures oxygen saturation in the blood and performs an EKG - simply a successful health monitoring. In addition, there is the elegance of a really beautiful watch that only needs to be charged once a month: That's what I was looking for.
January 24, 2021 | anonymous Very good watch The watch is very helpful for me, it would be nice if it could also measure blood pressure January 24, 2021 | anonymous Great Watch The Withings Scanwatch 42mm makes an incredibly valuable impression. It is made of stainless steel, relatively heavy and excellently processed. The possibilities that the watch offers are diverse. It serves as a 'normal' watch in daily life, while scanning pulse and breathing rate, number of steps and distance covered, as well as the number of floors climbed upon request. It is also suitable for sports, as a tracker for jogging or cycling. Particularly outstanding are the functions for measuring oxygen saturation and as a simple ECG for detecting symptoms of atrial fibrillation. Attention: You can set via the app whether the tracking for vital functions should be 'always on', automatically controlled or completely switched off. Permanent use reduces battery life. After several weeks of use, it can be said that the battery lasts for about ten days, but without excessive athletic use of the watch. Particularly good: Sleep tracking. Duration, depth, interruptions and above all breathing disorders during sleep are recorded. Very helpful! All these additional functions are either displayed live on the small round display in the upper area of the watch or in synchronization with a smartphone in the 'Health' app from Withings. In the present case, this works excellently on an iPhone. In addition, this small display shows incoming calls or messages, when connected to the smartphone. The lower small display with hands is only used to display the fulfillment of your own daily step goal. Less good: - The operation through the crown is very sensitive. For example, movements of the hand are sometimes pressed against the crown, which then sets a function in motion on the watch. - The measurement of breathing disorders during sleep does not work reliably in practice: With the 'automatic' setting, the watch measures for two or three nights, then no longer. This measurement is only continuous with the 'always on' setting. - The iPhone app could be more user-friendly, it is somewhat cumbersome. Overall, however, a full purchase recommendation.
January 23, 2021 | anonymous Beautiful, classic watch with comprehensive health functions An all-around good product, very well made, with first-class software under IOS. Beautiful as a classic wristwatch, powerful as a health monitor. The smartwatch functions, on the other hand, are underdeveloped, but I was aware of that and it doesn't bother me in the slightest.
January 23, 2021 | anonymous Withings Unisex-Adult Scanwatch Fast delivery. Great watch that does a lot when connected to a phone. Super.
January 21, 2021 | anonymous Everything works perfectly I've had the watch for about two weeks and I'm satisfied. All functions have been tested and work perfectly. Setting it up was also very easy. The only downside is the sleep recording. The recording starts continuously two hours after going to bed, which makes you wish for a little more precision.
January 21, 2021 | anonymous Toll Was a gift for my mother who mainly wanted it for the good EKG. She loves the watch. ???? January 21, 2021 | anonymous Very good watch with small limitations The watch is of very good quality and the design is pleasing, simple and not overloaded with high tech. The battery life depends on usage, for me about 20 days! The display is very easy to read, the menu navigation is well structured and user-friendly. No touchscreen, so no unwanted displays and functions. This is not a smartwatch that can do everything, but many things not quite right. But what is promised works perfectly. Unfortunately, it is not clearly stated that the ECG function only works properly above 50 BPM, it is measured but not meaningfully written into the diagram. The monitoring functions are reliable, the app is good and clear (subjective evaluation compared to Garmin, which I had before). The automatic workout recognition actually works! January 20, 2021 | anonymous Highly recommended for quickly checking the most important health parameters The Scan Watch makes a very valuable impression. That's why I bought it, also because of its functions. After initial difficulties with the installation, everything runs very well (I haven't tested the EKG yet). The support was prompt and targeted. You can tell that it is important to the manufacturer that the product works and the customer is satisfied. So I am very satisfied, can highly recommend the watch with a clear conscience and look forward to long-term support with health parameters determined by the watch, which are output to the smartphone.
January 20, 2021 | anonymous Completely satisfied Hello, I bought the watch as a Christmas present for my dad, he is 82 years old and is super happy with this watch, he was able to set it up himself, his sleep is monitored, all functions are flawless, when he receives a WhatsApp or email it vibrates slightly on his wrist. What was also important to him was the heart rate feature, as he had heart surgery, he can save it on his laptop and print it out for his doctor visits, his doctor is also impressed with the watch. So all in all, it can be recommended. We also ordered the leather strap because he had an allergic reaction to what was on it.
January 19, 2021 | anonymous EKG not available in Canada Great device but I bought for EKG function which isn't available in Canada...
January 17, 2021 | anonymous Super quality, very good app, constant connection to WITHINGS This is how I imagined the permanent monitoring of my atrial fibrillation syndrome, not cheap, but top-notch.
January 16, 2021 | anonymous Sleek and functional Very long battery life. The operation is very easy and without any issues. The apps work well. The rest is subjective. I like that the watch is not immediately recognized as a smartwatch and the scratch-free sapphire glass.
January 16, 2021 | anonymous Top watch! Elegant and precise! This watch is great and a great addition to keep track of your fitness and health. Activities, calories, timer, sleep quality are just as good as my old fitness watch and the values are equivalent. Now, in addition, keeping an eye on oxygen saturation is important in today's world. Plus, the watch is absolutely stylish.
January 15, 2021 | anonymous Good watch with potential Good watch that is not immediately recognized as a smartwatch. The sensors work without problems and also match the measurement of other devices. Battery lasts at least 4 weeks with normal use. The charger is magnetic and holds the watch well in position. However, a few minor things are still somewhat annoying. The app is good and clear, but at the beginning it forgot my watch. As a result, I had to reset it to factory settings to be able to register it again. The additional display only shows the progress of the goals, it would be nice if the seconds could be displayed here.
January 15, 2021 | anonymous Very strong battery life I found the smartwatch at the warehouse and was positively surprised from the beginning. Only the packaging was a little 'used'. The watch is in impeccable condition. The setup was quick and the operation is easy. After several Fi--it trackers, I am positively surprised by the app. It is clearly structured and 100% in German, and you are not forced to purchase any upgrades anywhere. The sensors work solidly and the battery life is huge.
January 15, 2021 | anonymous Very good Top, bought it for high blood pressure, everything is ok. Looks simple and elegant.
January 15, 2021 | anonymous Skin problems The watch itself is good. The only problem I had was that the skin under the sensor became inflamed. It strongly reminded me of nickel allergies. It has been healed for 2-3 weeks now.
January 15, 2021 | anonymous Withings Scan Watch A very good watch. It's a shame that the watch does not communicate with Komoot, as this app is very popular.
January 15, 2021 | anonymous EKG analysis and sleep rhythm Easy operation and good information of the data that is relevant to me January 15, 2021 | anonymous High-quality watch validated by medical professionals A very high-quality and very good-looking watch with high medical value, even used by clinics. The only downside for me is that during training, such as running, there is no pulse reading on the watch, only on the smartphone. It is very cumbersome and impractical to dig the smartphone out of the pocket to check the pulse while running. Therefore, 4 stars instead of 5. I am waiting for an update from the developers.
January 14, 2021 | anonymous Top Good product Would buy it again.
January 14, 2021 | anonymous Notification about atrial fibrillation The smartwatch is very well made and reliably transmits the collected data to the app on the phone. It's amazing how many functions you can access. For me, ECG recording is the most important thing, as I often suffer from atrial fibrillation. Since buying the watch, I have had two short episodes which were reliably reported and saved on my phone. So I finally have proof of when the events occurred. One small downside is the inaccuracy of pulse and SPO2. The oxygen saturation measurement usually results in a message of 'no result' even though my arm is resting on the table and my hand is pressing on the watch. I have a finger pulse oximeter for comparison.
January 14, 2021 | anonymous Beautiful watch with a small weakness Great watch that delivers what it promises. Unfortunately, I find that the sleep recording does not record shorter sleep times (e.g. 1-2 hours). Therefore, four stars.
January 12, 2021 | anonymous Reliable data up to sleep...
The 'watch' really keeps everything it promises. However, the sleep data is certainly not quite correct: if you lie awake for hours, but calmly in bed at night, a relatively good night is determined. It would be nice to have a second 'button' on the case that immediately records an ECG without having to scroll through the 'menu' first. Otherwise: Everything is top-notch and good quality! And it looks good too....
January 12, 2021 | anonymous Best watch from 2 worlds this is my second Withings watch with some distance. A predecessor of the Scanwatch had a fixed battery and was significantly worse processed. It was returned immediately at that time. In the meantime, I have bought the Samsung Galaxy Gear, the Watch 3 and also the Huawei GT 2 Pro. All three are not bad smartwatches and quite chic, but the watches from Samsung have a poor battery life and all functions can only be reached with Samsung smartphones. Although the battery life of Huawei is significantly better, the app selection is not so great. The Withings Scanwatch combines the analog chic with the essential functions excellently. The app is unparalleled, excellently designed and reliable. In addition, you can really do something with the ECG, blood oxygen and other measurements. The watch does not come across as bulky as the other two smartwatches, which are of course designed more than chronographs. The Scanwatch is a wonderful classic with outstanding battery life, which does not attract attention, fits everything and can also be individually designed thanks to the interchangeable bracelet. I find myself wearing Samsung and Huawei less and less because the Withings Scanwatch simply lasts a long time and reliably tracks everything. I opted for the dark, large dial, as the round OLED display hardly stands out here, even if it is and I think it looks great even on my rather narrow wrists. Absolute purchase recommendation! January 12, 2021 | anonymous Does what it should Good watch with many functions.
January 12, 2021 | anonymous Good article Good article January 12, 2021 | anonymous A great watch There is nothing negative to report.... It is a very good health watch... ...
January 12, 2021 | anonymous Too expensive Too little performance January 11, 2021 | anonymous It all works great.
Really a great device. It works flawlessly and you are always up to date. The mobile app is also very practical. I would recommend it to everyone.
January 11, 2021 | anonymous A very good scan watch with high potential I am very satisfied with the watch! First of all, I did not buy this watch as a smartwatch but as a scan watch to monitor my health and track my sports activities. Therefore, I have deactivated the display of messages. I particularly like the uncomplicated creation of an ECG! The sleep monitoring is also great and very meaningful for me. The analysis of oxygen saturation even alerted me early and directly to a possible corona infection with a display in the app! This was confirmed a few days later with all symptoms and a positive test. The app and its connection to this function work excellently, only the app itself still has potential for improvement in terms of content! The data for the 'doctor' as a PDF is a bit silly and simply prepared. A total display of all data, with selectable parameters, would also be desirable. The watch itself makes a valuable impression, but the design is rather simple. I have read in several reviews that there were problems with the ECG or oxygen saturation measurement, but I was and am able to perform these functions several times a day without any problems! Therefore, I consider the price-performance ratio to be balanced. The only thing I would like to say to Withings is: 'Make decent bracelets for the watches from the factory and stop this additional rip-off with the bracelets! Every 'China watch' has a good to very good metal bracelet on it!' January 9, 2021 | anonymous Top Flawless! I can't rate it any other way. I bought the Scanwatch as a Christmas present for my wife, and she is completely satisfied with it.
January 8, 2021 | anonymous The silicone wristband is impractical for me, it makes me sweat underneath.
The EKG function January 8, 2021 | anonymous Great purchase.
The watch exceeded my expectations. It's definitely worth the money.
January 8, 2021 | anonymous Great watch from Withings Once again, a great watch from Withings. Everything can be set up via the app and off you go. Top apps such as sleep quality measurement, timer and sports tracking. Very good workmanship of the watch, great stainless steel case with sapphire glass and comfortable strap. Nice size and bright display. One star deduction for the slightly too large crown. It presses on the wrist more often and sometimes a program starts on its own.
January 7, 2021 | anonymous Stylish hybrid watch! After the Apple Watch 3 and 6, I didn't like the look of pure smartwatches anymore and was bothered by the daily charging of the devices, so after a little research, I opted for the Withings and ordered it on a whim! The design looks very high-quality. You can exchange the bracelet for a chic leather one to better match the look. The functions are absolutely sufficient for me, also regarding sports. The store doesn't offer many additional apps. As of now, I am very satisfied and would recommend the watch if you don't want a pure smart or fitness watch, but also want it to look good.
January 7, 2021 | anonymous Simple and easy to use First smartwatch experience. The Withings Scanwatch looks like it's made in France, with a neat and luxurious feel that is suitable for business scenes. The settings were easy to configure via the app. In my case, I wanted to see the changes in my heart rate during swimming, but it was simply reported. I can't yet check the number of laps or strokes, but I'm looking forward to an update. The 50m waterproof function works well and can be used without any problems even in the sauna after swimming. It is convenient for people who want to monitor their own activities such as sleep and exercise by wearing the watch all the time, as the sleep status and score are displayed clearly. The battery can be used for up to two weeks without charging.
January 6, 2021 | anonymous Bewertung I use the watch to monitor my health condition. I am also satisfied. I have a question regarding the battery. I have reduced everything and the battery lasted for 9 days. The light is also off. How can I make the battery last longer? Although I must say 9 days is already very good. LG January 5, 2021 | anonymous Super watch with fitness data Super watch if you're looking for a watch and want to get fitness data delivered inconspicuously. That was also my wish. I have had it for three weeks now and am thrilled. The only weaknesses I see (at the moment) are that the sleep tracker is somewhat inaccurate. So it shows sleep time even when you're sitting in front of the TV. The second option is that it didn't recognize 4 hours of sleep time at all. Overall, I'm currently thrilled with the watch and the price-performance ratio and - the gigantic battery life.
January 5, 2021 | anonymous This Stupid Heart ❤ Top Watch My husband suffers from heart rhythm disorders. We have been looking for a watch that can record this and where he can control it for so long. The watch has many functions, there are numerous videos on Youtube about it. He got the watch for Christmas this year and set everything up right away. An EKG can be created quickly and can also be transmitted to the doctor. In terms of wearing comfort, it is also great. The price is already high, but also justified.
January 4, 2021 | anonymous High-quality watch - Pedometer a bit conservative ...
I bought the Withings Scanwatch because of the long battery life and the great design of the watch. Both are true and the high-quality workmanship has been confirmed. The software is also reliable and easy to use. The ECG and blood oxygen measurement work. Of course, the ECG measurement is not nearly as accurate as a professional multi-channel measurement at the doctor's office. I doubt that smaller heart rhythm disorders can be detected with it. Furthermore, I have noticed the following disadvantages:- The watch glass reflects extremely strongly and impairs readability- The pedometer is very conservative and counts about 30%-50% fewer steps compared to my phone. You have to step hard to count the steps. No problem when jogging, but many steps are not counted when walking slowly at home. I hope this will be corrected soon with a software update.- No weather or temperature display. I think this should be part of every smartwatch nowadays.If you can live with these minor restrictions, I can recommend this chic smartwatch! January 4, 2021 | anonymous Super! This is now my 4th SmartWatch from Withings/Nokia and I have to say that it performs the best and most accurate measurements of all. While the predecessors often did not continuously measure the pulse/heart rate, I receive complete 24/7 data with this watch, TOP! I cannot say anything yet about the ECG and oxygen saturation, as the predecessors did not have this function.
January 4, 2021 | anonymous Checking health data everything is optimal January 2, 2021 | anonymous Great health tracking! For my health, it detects cardiac arrhythmias and blood oxygen saturation levels, as well as everything else: sleep, calories, activities, steps, etc. It does not do ECG as it is not authorized by Health Canada, so access is blocked, but everything else works perfectly. The battery life is great, lasting over 2 weeks when I use the apps to the max 😉) otherwise, it lasts 1 month. Plus, it looks stylish :) January 2, 2021 | anonymous Highly recommended! Top battery life. Very nice watch Hello, the watch has been running since 3.12.2020 with the first charge and I have always worn it during the day and the battery still shows 19%!!! Top! I don't wear it at night, so I can't say anything about the sleep tracking. All incoming notifications come immediately from the apps that are set up on the iPhone and the app. The watch is perfectly crafted and makes a very high-quality impression. I switched from the Apple Watch 6 because I wanted a nice round watch that also gives me all the information. I have also tried some other watches from Huawei and so on, but that's not the real deal if you use an iPhone!
