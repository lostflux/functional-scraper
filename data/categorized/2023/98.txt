Construction Projects underway Site infrastructure New buildings emerge The concrete facade of the Tokamak Complex is now obscured by the High Voltage Building for neutral beam power supply (black, centre). Other fast-evolving features on the platform include the structure of a new bridge for the transfer of electrical power to the magnets (right) and the low-voltage Neutral Beam Power Supply Building (left).
29 August 2023 Download New bridges In addition to the cryobridge (foreground, for the distribution of cryogenic lines) there are now two other bridges spanning the main boulevard of the platform They are busbar bridges, for the transport of electrical busbars from the Magnet Power Conversion buildings to the Tokamak Complex.
29 August 2023 Download Inside the cryobridge In order to connect the cryolines coming from the cryoplant to those already installed in the Tokamak Building, the cryobridge runs for 130 metres, first crossing the boulevard and then making a sharp left turn to run along the Assembly Hall. This employee is inside the cryobridge, walking towards the cryoplant.
29 August 2023 Download Late August Despite the heat waves of July and August, progress made over the summer is observable in every corner of the ITER platform. The last major addition to the construction platform will be the Hot Cell Facility, a large building will go up where the two cranes are standing, at left.
29 August 2023 Download Overhead The completed cryobridge is 13 metres above the platform. Two other bridges along this road will house electrical busbars (one can be seen in construction in the background).
20 June 2023 Download Sturdy yet flexible Cryogenic process lines will be sheltered in this cryobridge, designed to withstand 200 tonnes of dead load and the "pushing and pulling" of the lines.
04 May 2023 Download Bridge with an angle A covered bridge runs 70 metres from the cryoplant to the Assembly Hall, before abruptly turning left at a 90-degree angle to run parallel to the Assembly Hall for another 60 metres in order to reach the Tokamak Complex. Its purpose? To carry gas and liquid helium to "clients" (superconducting magnets, thermal shield, cryopumps).
04 May 2023 Download Welcoming visitors on site The ITER Visitors Centre dominates the work site, and is a good place to start for visitors.

04 October 2022 Download Right angle To reach and enter the opening in the concrete wall of the Tokamak Complex, the cryobridge has to make a 90-degree turn. This has added complexity to the design of the structure, as the pressurized flow of cryogenic fluids at this location will cause intense traction forces.
30 August 2022 Download First bridge on site Three bridges will cross this major artery on the ITER platform. The first, connecting the cryoplant to the Tokamak Complex, is under construction now.

21 January 2021 Download TAPB building, finished on time The Tokamak Assembly Preparation Building (TAPB) construction team completed this building to nuclear specifications in nine months. The team was recognized by a 2020 ITER Award, winning in the "Balance-of-Plant Systems" category in December.
08 January 2021 Download Space needed The need for storage and workshop spaces is high on the ITER site and every ounce of space must be utilized. This additional building just went up near the European Poloidal Field Coils Winding Facility. Â© Les Nouveaux MÃ©dias/SNC ENGAGE 22 December 2020 Download Under the surface Our eyes are mostly focused on work happening above the platform ... but a lot is happening just under the surface to ensure that power, water and services are distributed around the platform. Â© Les Nouveaux MÃ©dias/SNC ENGAGE 22 December 2020 Download Still in its cocoon The cryostat upper cylinder is still waiting in its protective cocoon to be called into the Assembly Hall.

20 October 2020 Download TAPB: fully erected In a northeastern corner of the platform, not far from the Assembly Hall, the Tokamak Assembly Preparatory Building is fully erected. It is a one-story building, with a full basement.
12 October 2020 Download Managing AC current What can be contained in a medium-size building in a steelworks or other heavy industrial facility requires a one-hectare yard at ITER. Adjacent to the Reactive Power Control Building (background), the reactive power compensators area accommodates reactors, capacitors, resistors and sensors that aim to smooth the flow of AC current both inside the ITER installation and in the immediate vicinity.
04 October 2020 Download ITER fully connected Three 400 kV transformers for the pulsed power electrical network (PPEN) have been energized. Going forward, the French operator RTE considers ITER as fully connected and operational, with all seven ITER connections at the 400kV level in operation. (There are three transformers for the pulsed power network and four for the steady state electrical network.) 30 September 2020 Download Machining workshop installed on site The new workshop will be operated by the DYNAMIC consortium, which was formed to execute one of ITER's two main machine assembly contracts, TAC2 (Tokamak Assembly Contract 2). The workshop will be a space for repairs and retrofitting, and boasts two milling machines, a large CNC (Computer Numeric Control) machine, and spaces for welding and metrology.
