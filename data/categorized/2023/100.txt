Read more about the 15-year industrial adventure to produce ten toroidal field coils in Europe here: https://www.iter.org/newsline/-/3767 23 October 2023 Download On the way to ITER Bringing an ITER component from the French port of Fos-sur-Mer to the ITER site is a stepwise process: road transport from the port to the loading dock at the inland sea of Berre (pictured), a several-hour crossing of the inland sea by barge, and finally transfer to the 104-kilometre road itinerary that leads to ITER.
18 October 2023 Download Feeder component from China An "in-cryostat feeder" has reached France from China. This semi-circular component will fit inside the cylindrical cryostat to deliver power, cryogens and instrumentation to four of the top correction coils.
12 October 2023 Download Last D-shaped coil from Japan arrives in France Toroidal field coil #19 has been unloaded at Fos-sur-Mer. This nineteenth coil, supplied by Japan, has been planned as a spare as the ITER machine only needs 18.
