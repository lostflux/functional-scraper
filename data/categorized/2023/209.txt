Scientific American Stories by Anil Ananthaswamy Quantum Theory's 'Measurement Problem' May Be a Poison Pill for Objective Reality Solving a notorious quantum quandary could require abandoning some of science’s most cherished assumptions about the physical world Anil Ananthaswamy Is Our Universe a Hologram? Physicists Debate Famous Idea on Its 25th Anniversary The Ads/CFT duality conjecture suggests our universe is a hologram, enabling significant discoveries in the 25 years since it was first proposed Anil Ananthaswamy Is Our Universe a Hologram? Physicists Debate Famous Idea on Its 25th Anniversary The Ads/CFT duality conjecture suggests our universe is a hologram, enabling significant discoveries in the 25 years since it was first proposed Anil Ananthaswamy Astronomers Might See Dark Matter by Staring into the Void Vast reaches of mostly empty space could offer superior odds for detecting the invisible substance thought to make up more than 80 percent of the material in the universe Anil Ananthaswamy Astronomers Gear Up to Grapple with the High-Tension Cosmos A debate over conflicting measurements of key cosmological properties is set to shape the next decade of astronomy and astrophysics Anil Ananthaswamy Could Echoes from Colliding Black Holes Prove Stephen Hawking's Greatest Prediction? Subtle signals from black hole mergers might confirm the existence of “Hawking radiation”—and gravitational-wave detectors may have already seen them Anil Ananthaswamy Dark Matter May Be Missing from This Newfound Galaxy, Astronomers Say A growing number of galaxies seem to be bereft of the mysterious substance, posing fresh challenges for some of cosmology’s most cherished theories Anil Ananthaswamy Can We Gauge Quantum Time of Flight? Measuring the time it takes particles to travel between two points may be the best test yet for Bohmian mechanics Anil Ananthaswamy AI Designs Quantum Physics Experiments beyond What Any Human Has Conceived Originally built to speed up calculations, a machine-learning system is now making shocking progress at the frontiers of experimental quantum physics Anil Ananthaswamy Quantum Astronomy Could Create Telescopes Hundreds of Kilometers Wide Astronomers hope to use innovations from the subatomic world to construct breathtakingly large arrays of optical observatories Anil Ananthaswamy Telescopes on Far Side of the Moon Could Illuminate the Cosmic Dark Ages Instruments deployed on missions to the lunar far side might give us an unprecedented view of the early universe Anil Ananthaswamy Do We Live in a Simulation? Chances Are about 50–50 Gauging whether or not we dwell inside someone else’s computer may come down to advanced AI research—or measurements at the frontiers of cosmology Anil Ananthaswamy Physicists Create City-Sized Ultrasecure Quantum Network Capable of connecting eight or more users across distances of 17 kilometers, the demonstration is another milestone toward developing a fully quantum Internet Anil Ananthaswamy Quantum Tunneling Is Not Instantaneous, Physicists Show A new experiment tracks the transit time of particles burrowing through barriers, revealing previously unknown details of a deeply counterintuitive phenomenon Anil Ananthaswamy How Many Aliens Are in the Milky Way? Astronomers Turn to Statistics for Answers The tenets of Thomas Bayes, an 18th-century statistician and minister, underpin the latest estimates of the prevalence of extraterrestrial life Anil Ananthaswamy How Heavy is the Universe? Conflicting Answers Hint at New Physics The discrepancy could be a statistical fluke—or a sign that physicists will need to revise the standard model of cosmology Anil Ananthaswamy Faced with a Data Deluge, Astronomers Turn to Automation For better or worse, machine learning and big data are poised to transform the study of the heavens Anil Ananthaswamy The Quantum Internet Is Emerging, One Experiment at a Time Breakthrough demonstrations using defective diamonds, high-flying drones, laser-bathed crystals and other exotica suggest practical, unhackable quantum networks are within reach Anil Ananthaswamy Spin-Swapping Particles Could Be "Quantum Cheshire Cats" A proposed experiment to swap fundamental properties between photons carries profound implications for our understanding of reality itself Anil Ananthaswamy Found: A Quadrillion Ways for String Theory to Make Our Universe Stemming from the “F-theory” branch of string theory, each solution replicates key features of the standard model of particle physics Anil Ananthaswamy Best-Yet Measurements Deepen Cosmological Crisis The latest disagreement over the universe’s expansion rate suggests researchers may be on the threshold of revolutionary discoveries Anil Ananthaswamy Has LIGO Seen Galaxy-Warped Gravitational Waves? Nobel laureate George Smoot claims LIGO has observed amplified signals of black hole mergers from the very distant universe, but LIGO scientists disagree Anil Ananthaswamy The Human Eye Could Help Test Quantum Mechanics Experiments to confirm we can see single photons offer new ways to probe our understanding of quantum reality Anil Ananthaswamy Support Our Mission Discover world-changing science. Explore our digital archive back to 1845, including articles by more than 150 Nobel Prize winners.
