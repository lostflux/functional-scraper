AboutMachineScienceConstructionAssemblyNews & MediaTopThe "basement" of the Tokamak ComplexUnderneath the B2 basemat slab are the 493 pillars and anti-seismic bearings that will support the weight of the Tokamak Complex. With 1.9 metres between the lower concrete slab and the upper slab, there's plenty of room to move around.
28 October 2014Mission accomplishedThe end of B2 slab works is celebrated with a traditional méchoui (roast lamb on a spit) on 18 September.
18 September 2014Lowering the cranesNow that the Tokamak Complex foundations are in place, the four corner cranes used by the GTM consortium are coming down. They will be replaced by five taller cranes (including one that will work from the centre of the basemat) for wall construction.
08 September 2014The completed slabThe B2 slab—14,000 m³ of concrete, 3,600 tonnes of reinforcement and 2,500 embedded plates—stands ready to receive the first walls of the Tokamak Complex.
02 September 2014The B2 slab is "topped out"An olive branch is left by workers in the centre of the completed Tokamak Complex basemat slab (B2 slab). Originating in Eastern Europe, this construction tradition called "topping out" symbolizes the end of works.
02 September 2014A landmark day for ITERThe completion of the 9,300 m² B2 slab on 27 August concludes four years of work (2010-2014) to create a ground support structure for the Tokamak Complex.
27 August 2014A lot of materialThe last pour—for the circular central segment of the basemat—required 865 m³ of concrete. In total, the 1.5-metre-thick B2 slab contains 3,600 tonnes of rebar and 14,000 m³ of concrete.
27 August 2014The floor is finished493 anti-seismic columns and pads are sandwiched between the B2 slab, completed today, and the lower basemat installed on the floor of the Tokamak Pit. The B2 slab will be the first basement level of the Diagnostic, Tokamak and Tritium buildings.
27 August 2014Standing on the slabWorks were carried out by the F4E construction consortium led by GTM Sud from France. GTM was also in charge of the excavation of the Tokamak Complex Seismic Pit (August 2010-April 2011) and the construction of the lower level basemat and retaining walls (April 2011-April 2012).
27 August 2014It's done!The B2 slab, which will support some 400,000 tonnes of building and equipment (including the 23,000-tonne ITER Tokamak), is now in place.
27 August 2014Just the right formulationConsistency and spreadability are important to ensuring the homogenous distribution of the concrete. These parameters are tested as the concrete leaves the on-site batching plant, before it gets loaded into the mixer trucks. Photo: F4E27 August 2014A series of important operationsThe concrete is poured (far left), vibrated to eliminate air pockets (middle left) and smoothed for a perfect finish (far right). Photo: F4E27 August 2014Any day nowOn 26 August, workers carry out the final activities on the central segment to prepare for concrete pouring, which is imminent.
26 August 2014Preparing for the last pourWorkers are busy preparing the last pour of the Tokamak Complex B2 slab.
21 August 2014Bull's eyeIn the very centre, is a large circular embedded plate that will be used as a base for securing machinery or equipment.
21 August 2014The last pour will be circularIn terms of volume, it's slightly less than the surrounding segments. The last pour of the B2 basemat slab will require 865 m³ of concrete.
21 August 2014Southern segments completedA smooth concrete surface is now in place in the southern part of the Tokamak Pit, where the foundations of the Diagnostic Building abut those of the Tokamak Building.
21 August 2014Northern segments completedLooking toward the excavated area for the future Hot Cell, and also towards ITER Headquarters, the concrete foundation of the Tritium Building is now flush with that of its neighbour, the Tokamak Building.
21 August 2014Last measurements before pouringIn the centre of the basemat, a large steel ring (topped with a blue steel structure designed to prevent deformation) will be deeply anchored in the concrete. Its purpose? To provide a base for the huge inner support column that will stabilize the vacuum vessel sectors during the first stages of machine assembly.
09 August 2014All through the nightFor three weeks this summer, contractors had the authorization to carry out night pours. On a summer night, the temperature is ideal for concrete pouring ... Photo: F4E05 August 2014Taking advantage of a clear nightOn three occasions in July and in August, the pouring operations took place at night from 10:30 p.m. to noon the next day. Photo: F4E05 August 2014Rapid progress on the B2 slabThe thirteenth B2 slab segment out of fifteen) is poured on 5 August. Photo: F4E05 August 2014Closing in on the centreOn 29 July, the fourth of nine central segments is poured. To create the 9,600 square-metre Tokamak Complex basemat slab, workers will have used 14,000 cubic metres of concrete and 3,600 tonnes of rebar.
29 July 2014A fish-eye view of the Tokamak PitPouring continues for the central segments of the Tokamak Complex basemat on 29 July.
29 July 2014Work begins on the central areaPouring begins on 10 July 2014 on the central area of the B2 slab--which will support the machine--following the green light from the French Nuclear Safety Authority (ASN). Nine segments make up the central part of the slab.
10 July 2014Starting in one cornerA 627-square-metre segment, adjacent to the Diagnostics Building slab on the north side of Seismic Pit, was the first of nine plots to be poured on 10 July.
10 July 20141.5 metres thickFrom this angle the thickness of the B2 basemat slab (1.5 metres) is clearly visible.
07 July 2014Tritium slab completedThe third and final pour for the Tritium Building basemat was carried out on 26 June. Now only the nine central segments remain to complete the Tokamak Complex basemat.
01 July 2014A solid foundation for the Tokamak ComplexWhen completed, the 9,600 m² Tokamak Complex basemat will have incorporated some 14,000 tonnes of concrete and 3,600 tonnes of steel.
01 July 2014Nine segments to goConcrete pouring in the central area will be carried out from July to September 2014.
01 July 2014Next, the walls will riseRebar is already in place for certain of the Tokamak Complex's walls. Building construction begins in 2014.
01 July 2014Pouring on a sunny day1,155 cubic metres of specially formulated concrete went into the second segment of the Tritium Building basemat slab. Pouring conditions on 19 June were ideal.
19 June 2014Segment #5 is poured in JuneOn 19 June, workers pour the second Tritium Building basemat segment. There are ten segments to go to complete the Tokamak Complex slab19 June 2014Strong progress in the Seismic PitApproximately 100 people are currently working in the Seismic Pit, laying rebar, securing embedded plates, and preparing for the next two segment pours for the Tritium Building.
27 May 20144,000 tons of iron and a mockupIron elements for the B2 foundation slab are stored near a full-scale mockup on the platform that reproduces the most complex areas of reinforced concrete. Once poured, the concrete will be closely examined to make sure that it is uniformly distributed throughout the mockup's dense metal skeleton.
21 May 2014Under the future machineThe ITER machine (vacuum vessel, magnets plus cryostat) will measure 30 metres in width and as many in height. It will weigh an estimated 23,000 tonnes.
21 May 2014Thousands of embedded platesEmbedded plates are set into position before any concrete pouring activity can be carried out; once the buildings are in place, equipment and machinery will be welded to these plates.
20 May 2014Playing heavy metalSome say it looks like the largest record player in the world! Some 400,000 tonnes of building, machinery and equipment will be contained in this large concrete box called the Tokamak Complex Seismic Pit.
29 April 2014Inspectors in the heart of the webOn Thursday, 24 April, inspectors from the French Nuclear Safety Authority (ASN) carry out an inspection of ongoing reinforcement work on the Tokamak Complex basemat slab. They are pictured inspecting the very centre of the rebar web that will support the future Tokamak Building.
24 April 2014Going up!This vertical rebar is the first set into place for the future walls of the Tokamak Complex. Photo: F4E21 April 2014The most complex part of the puzzleSome 4,000 metric tons of steel rebar will reinforce the Tokamak Complex basemat. The central part of the basemat will be poured in nine segments. Photo: F4E21 April 2014Planning for pouringIn the dense rebar under the Tokamak Building, space is left every few metres for the vibrating tools that will ensure that the wet concrete reaches every nook and cranny. Photo: F4E21 April 2014Eleven segments to a completed basematThe Tokamak Complex basemat will be poured in fifteen segments. Pour days are scheduled this month and next to complete the Tritium Building basemat (at the far end of the Seismic Pit); rebar work in the centre should be finished in July.
10 April 2014The eye of the torusIn the central area of the Tokamak Pit, a combination of orthogonal and orthodradial rebar create a particularly tight and complex pattern. As work advances, metal "chairs" are installed to separate the first layers of rebar from the top layers.
21 March 2014Let's switch sides!Concrete is poured on 19 March in the northeast corner of the Tokamak Pit. This fourth segment (638 square metres, 957 cubic metres of concrete) is the first part of the Tritium Building basemat to be poured.
19 March 2014Progress on the basematThe fourth pour day for the Tokamak Complex basemat was carried out on 19 March. Pouring has begun for the Tritium Building basemat on the north end of the Pit.
19 March 2014Maintaining a clean surfaceOn the completed Diagnostics Building basemat, pressurized air is used to keep the surface clean. The cages in the picture mark out the pillars that will be poured to support the second floor of the building.
04 March 2014Spot in the middleIn the very centre of the Seismic Pit stands the last viewable seismic pad. The Tokamak Complex will rest on 493 such pads, part of the measures that will protect the scientific infrastructure in the case of ground motion.
04 March 2014Where orthoradial and orthogonal meetUnder the future Tokamak, crisscrossed layers of orthoradial (circular) and orthogonal (right-angled) rebar form a pleasing geometric pattern.
04 March 2014Diagnostics Building basematThe completed basemat for the Diagnostics Building now stands 1.5 metres over the rebar of the central section. By next autumn, the floor of the Tokamak Complex will be in place.
04 March 2014A 1:1-scale mockup for Tokamak basemat reinforcementThis mockup of Tokamak basemat reinforcement is being prepared for concrete. Because of the complexity and density of rebar in the region under the Tokamak, concrete pouring is a complex operation that will be tested first here.
04 March 2014Rebar gridA close-up view of the dense rebar that is being laid for the Tokamak Complex basemat.
04 March 2014The Pit in FebruaryIn February, work on the rebar arrangement in the centre of the Tokamak Pit--that will support the machine--resumes. Sixteen layers of orthoradial (circular) and orthogonal (right-angled) rebar will be integrated into the 1.5-metre-thick basemat.
27 February 2014Getting ready to pour the foundations of the Tritium BuildingThe next area of the B2 slab to be poured is on the north side of the Seismic Pit under the Tritium Building. Just like for the Diagnostics Building, pouring will take place in three stages (beginning in March).
26 February 2014A sea of ironReinforcement works should continue in the Tokamak Pit through July. Some 4,000 tonnes of iron rebar will be part of the Tokamak Complex slab. Photo: F4E19 February 2014Standing on the rebarOn the Diagnostic Building side of the Tokamak Pit, work to prepare for a concrete pour is underway. The squares at ground level are the embedded plates that will be used to fix equipment and machinery in the completed structure. Photo: F4E15 February 2014Looking westThe tall crane allows us to imagine the height of the future Tokamak Complex: 60 metres. Photo: F4E15 February 2014Heave ho!Alternate layers of rebar—circular or radial—are set into place under the future ITER machine. Photo: F4E15 February 2014A full day of workAs concrete is poured in February for the Diagnostics Building basemat, workers use equipment to ensure that the material settles uniformly, without air pockets. Photo: F4E15 February 2014Last pour for the Diagnostics BuildingThe final segment poured on the south side of the Tokamak Pit measures 600 square metres (900 cubic metres of concrete). Photo: F4E15 February 2014Pouring completed for Diagnostics Building basematOn Thursday 13 February, the third and final segment of the Diagnostics Building basemat was successfully poured. Concrete pouring activities will continue in March on the opposite end of the Seismic Pit, under the future Tritium Building. Photo: ENGAGE13 February 2014Where the action is happeningA wide angle lens captures nearly the entire Tokamak Pit. Photo: F4E13 February 2014Looking northThree distinct work areas are visible in February in the 90 x 130 metre Seismic Pit: in the foreground, the beginning of concrete works for the Diagnostic Building slab; at the far end, ongoing reinforcement works for the Tritium Building slab; and in the centre, the positioning of rebar layers (16 in all) under the future Tokamak Building.
12 February 2014Careful calculationsEach iron bar, weighing nearly 100 kilos, is carefully laid and affixed.
03 February 2014Progress on the basematOn the southern end of the Seismic Pit, two of the three basemat segments are in place and the third will be filled in mid-February. Concrete pouring activity will then be transferred to the opposite side.
03 February 2014Reinforcement work resumesIn the centre of the Seismic Pit, under the future Tokamak, work resumed on the complex pattern of steel reinforcement bars.
28 January 2014Pouring on a cold dayThe concrete is still warm when it arrives at its destination, having lost only a couple of degrees Celsius during transport. The concrete is made with heated water and gravel in the on-site batching plant and leaves the facility at 14-17 °C.
22 January 2014Early morning fogThe raised reinforcement along the Seismic Pit wall that we can just distinguish to the right will on day support the load of the Diagnostics Building. A third and final pour will complete this part of the basemat.
22 January 2014Second segment of basemat completedOn 22 January 2014, the second of fifteen Tokamak Complex basemat segments was poured over a ten-hour shift starting at 6:00 a.m. All work should be completed in July.
22 January 2014And on the left ...
It's easy to distinguish the reinforcement going on for the Tritium Building, which will occupy the left side of the Seismic Pit, from the reinforcement that will support the weight of the ITER Tokamak and Tokamak Building (centre).
15 January 2014One down, fourteen to goThe first concrete pour took place under the future Diagnostics Building, part of the three-building Tokamak Complex. Fifteen pour days in all will be necessary to complete the B2 slab; then, the walls will begin to rise.
17 December 2013First B2 segment in placeUnder the blue drying tents, the first 21 x 26 metre segment is in place for the Tokamak Complex basemat slab (the B2 slab). The next pour is scheduled for early 2014.
17 December 201312-hour pour dayThe first segment is a 21 x 26 m area under the future Diagnostics Building. Over the 12-hour day, a volume of 800 m3 of concrete is poured. Photo: F4E11 December 2013Continuous flowThe pumps are fed in a continuous flow by concrete trucks that drive back and forth from the on-site batching plant. Photo: F4E11 December 2013An early day for someThe first segment of the B2 basemat was poured in approximately 12 hours by two shifts of workers. The first team of 20 began the day at 4:00 a.m. to prepare the work site.
11 December 2013ITER-grade concreteThe concrete formulation is the same as that used for the seismic columns of the Seismic Pit, tested over twenty times for its properties of stability, water permeability and gas confinement.
11 December 2013Keeping the concrete warmSpecial measures were put into place to keep the concrete at its minimum required temperature, including protective covers and hot air blowers at the pouring site.
11 December 2013On-site production of concreteTwo pumps worked in unison to deliver the special-grade concrete, qualified for the specificities of the ITER facility through extensive testing and produced in an on-site batching plant.
11 December 2013Pouring beginsIn the northwest corner of the Seismic Pit, under the future Diagnostics Building, the first concrete pouring for the B2 slab got under way at 6:24 a.m. on 11 December 2013.
11 December 2013All in a rowSome 750 of the 2,600 planned embedded plates for the Tokamak Complex basemat have been installed. These plates provide robust anchorage for equipment and tooling.
29 November 2013Small coffee tables with supernumerary legs?No. Embedded plates waiting for installation. These plates will provide extremely robust anchorage for the devices that need to be attached to the walls (or floors, or ceilings) of the Tokamak Complex and that can weigh several tons.
08 October 2013Installation of embedded platesOnce the foundation is poured, these embedded plates will be solid support for the elements that will be welded to their surface.
08 October 2013Seen from the craneTo the left of the future Tokamak Building: Tritium. To the right: Diagnostics. Concrete pouring for the B2 basemat slab will begin in these areas.

01 October 2013Reinforcement underwayWhen reinforcement work ends, 4,000 tonnes of steel rebar will be in place at the bottom of the Tokamak Seismic Pit—part of the B2 foundation slab that will support the Diagnostic, Tokamak and Tritium buildings.
01 October 20131.5 metres of reinforcement in the Tokamak Complex basematMetal "chairs" are positioned on the bottom layer of crisscrossed rebar. Steel reinforcement will be built up to 1.5 metres before foundation pouring begins.
01 October 2013Space to walk all aroundBetween the Tokamak Complex and the retaining walls of the Seismic Pit there will be a gap of about 2 metres ... space for lateral movement in case of ground motion.
01 October 2013Positioned just soThe encounter of radial reinforcement and linear reinforcement creates a striking pattern on the floor of the Tokamak Complex.
01 October 2013In so many rowsSixteen of the sixty thousand embedded plates will be integrated into the Tokamak Complex basemat (see the squares being settled into place on the Diagnostics end of the Seismic Pit).
26 September 2013Heads up!In the floors, walls and ceilings of the Tokamak Complex there will be roughly 60,000 embedded plates to provide extremely robust anchorage, capable of supporting loads of up to ~90 metric tons in pure traction. Photo: F4E26 September 2013Progress is in the detailsConcrete pouring will begin in October on the opposite ends of the Tokamak Pit, where workers have nearly completed the 1.5 metres of reinforcement.
18 September 2013Two storeys below groundWhen the B2 basemat slab is completed in 2014 the Tokamak Complex will begin to rise. The lower elements of the Tokamak machine will sit two levels below the surface of the platform.
18 September 2013Machine + cryostat + bioshieldIn the area occupied by circular rebar, the ITER Tokamak (23 metres in diameter) will be positioned in the centre, surrounded by its cryostat (30 metres in diameter) and concrete bioshield.
18 September 2013Rebar risesA wall of rebar rises on the site of the future Tritium Building. Early in the morning on 6 September 2013—the day of the Ministerial-Level Meeting—a last interview takes place before the buses return to Headquarters.
06 September 2013Tokamak Pit coveredThe last section of the Tokamak Pit to be covered by formwork is the lift shaft for the transfer of components between the Tokamak Building and the Hot Cell.
03 September 2013The basement of the Tokamak ComplexUnderneath the 1.5-metre-thick concrete floor of the Tokamak Complex there will be room to move around—nearly 2 metres worth, enough for the regular inspection of the seismic pads.
22 August 2013A small B2 slabA smaller version of the next-phase Tokamak Complex basemat slab (B2) can already be found on site: the 150 m2 slab mockup even recreates the various-size anchor plates that will be embedded to support equipment.
22 August 2013A lot to supportBefore concrete pouring can begin, space must be set aside for embedded parts—some 60,000 anchor plates that will be embedded into the slab and walls of the Tokamak Complex to support equipment.
22 August 2013Scale mockup still in useThe Director-General of ITER, Osamu Motojima, stands with Nuclear Buildings Section Leader Laurent Patisson on top of the scale model of B2 reinforcement situtated to one side of the Seismic Pit. Here the complex pattern of steel reinforcement planned for the Tokamak Complex slab is studied.
24 July 2013Building up the rebar to 1.5 metresThe second basemat in the Tokamak Pit—the 1.5-metre-thick B2 slab—will be the floor of the Tokamak Complex, supporting the Diagnostic, Tokamak and Tritium buildings. The basemat should be in place by the end of the year.
20 July 2013Reinforcement continuesSuccessive layers of metal reinforcement are positioned in the Tokamak Pit. Concrete pouring will be carried out throughout the autumn.
20 July 2013One last sectionOf the 11,700 square metre surface of the Seismic Pit, this small area is the only one not yet covered by propping, formwork and rebar. Machinery for the cask transfer lift, which will transport components between the main building and the Hot Cell, must be installed first.
20 July 2013All together nowFrom approximately 200 people on site currently, worker numbers will rise to 1,000 at the end of the year, before climbing to 2,000, then 3,000 at the peak of construction activities.
15 July 2013Assembling the rebarOn the site of the future Diagnostics Building, rebar structures take their place. If all goes according to schedule, concrete pouring will begin on this side of the Tokamak Pit in August.
15 July 2013Under the summer sunWork continues in the Tokamak Pit in July 2013.
15 July 2013The thickness of the basematLooking at the rebar from the side, we get a sense of the thickness of the basemat that will support the weight of the Tokamak Complex.
10 July 2013The Pit ... from aboveThe far end of the 90 x 130 metre Seismic Pit is reserved for the Diagnostic Building—as an experimental machine ITER will have some 45 diagnostic systems. The near end rectangle will house the Tritium Building. And in the centre ... well, you don't need us to tell you. Photo: GTM Bâtiment VINCI26 June 2013The heart of the matterThe ITER Tokamak will sit in the centre of the Tokamak Pit, surrounded by its cryostat and bioshield.

18 June 2013A bit of vertical in the horizontalPoking up from the horizontal bed of rebar are the tops of each seismic pad.
18 June 2013Layer twoAfter the first radial pattern of reinforcement, workers are now laying concentric circles of rebar around the central point.
18 June 2013That's it, they're goneThe 493 seismic pads are now hidden from view and the Seismic Pit is no longer 17 metres deep ... With the completion of the ground support structure and the newest propping, it's more like 13 metres deep.
18 June 2013Reinforcement work underwayIn mid-June, only a small section of the Tokamak Pit still requires propping and formwork. Work is underway to position 4,000 tonnes of steel rebar—in radial/circular patterns in some areas, linear in others.
18 June 2013In between the behemothsThis gap between the Tokamak Complex and the Assembly Building will permit the installation of critical networks such as electricity, piping and cooling.

26 May 2013A strategic notch in the wallThe propping and formwork extends to the very walls of the Seismic Pit. And yet, all of these materials will have to be removed once the basemat is in place so that the seismic pads will remain accessible for inspection. How will it be done? A notch in the far wall will be the "exit door" through which the material will be removed.
21 May 2013Looking towards HeadquartersIn just three months, the seismic columns have nearly disappeared from view. Work will begin late in May on reinforcement work in the area of the Tokamak.
21 May 2013Propping and formwork are nearly done; reinforcement beginsLevel with the top of the seismic pads, the crisscrossing of reinforcement bars gets underway in May. Four to five months will be necessary to lay 4,000 tonnes of rebar.
21 May 2013Concrete pouring tests on mockupThe 1:1 scale mockup of B2 foundation slab reinforcement is now ready for concrete pouring tests. The challenge will be to ensure that the concrete is uniformly distributed throughout the mockup's dense metal skeleton.

Under the future Diagnostics Building, it's easy to see the linear pattern of the anti-seismic pads and columns, compared to the Tokamak "star pattern" at left.
08 April 2013Scale model of B2 reinforcementAdjacent to the Tokamak Pit, a 150 m2 mockup has been set up to demonstrate the complex pattern of the steel reinforcement bars planned for the B2 foundation slab. Four different areas of rebar presenting specific challenges (density, complexity) will be reproduced at 1:1 scale in the mockup.
03 April 2013Stage by stageThe B2 slab will progress in stages: propping and formwork will take place February through June, followed by reinforcement work (April through August) and concrete pouring (June through December).
03 April 2013Preparatory works for the B2 slabFirst silver, then yellow, then brown: on top of these aluminium props, workers will install yellow formwork, which in turn will be covered by wooden structures.

07 March 2013B2 prep work beginsThe basemat for the Tokamak Complex—the 1.5 metre-thick B2 slab—will sit directly on top of the Seismic Pit's 493 columns and pads. On 27 February 2013, the Central Integration & Engineering Directorate completed the challenging mission of closing B2 slab design and obtaining model approval in a meeting held with the European Domestic Agency and the Architect Engineer ENGAGE. Work began immediately on B2 propping and formwork activities in the Seismic Pit.
27 February 2013The Tokamak Complex will rise hereThe construction consortium chosen in December to build the 360,000-tonne Tokamak Complex is establishing offices on site and working on the detailed design of the structure. As the formwork is removed from the drying basemat in November, work will begin on the civil works. Photo: F4E01 February 2013The 1.8 metre column plus padBetween the bottom slab (which the seismic pads rest on) and the upper slab there will be a gap of two metres. All of the formwork supporting the second slab will have to be removed through this gap.
