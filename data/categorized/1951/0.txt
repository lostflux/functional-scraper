ACM has opened more than 117,500 articles published between 1951 and the end of 2000, during the first 50 years of its publishing program. These articles, which include many foundational articles by the pioneers of the field, are now freely available to view and download via the ACM DL.
Recognizing that many computing researchers, practitioners, and academics continue to work remotely, the ACM DL has implemented several options for remote access through subscribing institutions. Please contact your library or ACM to request this access.

The notion that within a few decades the challenge would be how to interconnect millions of computers around the globe was too far-fetched to contemplate. ...
Probabilistic and Causal Inference: The Works of Judea PearlICREA and Universitat Pompeu FabraUniversity of California, IrvineCornell UniversityProfessor Judea Pearl won the 2011 Turing Award “for fundamental contributions to artificial intelligence through the development of a calculus for probabilistic and causal reasoning.” This book contains the original articles that led to the award, as ...
Applied Affective ComputingMonash UniversityMonash UniversityCarnegie Mellon University and University of GenevaUtah State UniversityAdobe Research, San JoseRice UniversityAffective computing is a nascent field situated at the intersection of artificial intelligence with social and behavioral science. It studies how human emotions are perceived and expressed, which then informs the design of intelligent agents and systems ...
Theories of Programming: The Life and Works of Tony HoareNewcastle University, UKThe University of Texas at Austin, USSir Tony Hoare has had an enormous influence on computer science, from the Quicksort algorithm to the science of software development, concurrency and program verification.
