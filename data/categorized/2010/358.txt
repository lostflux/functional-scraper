ContentsSynopsisCharacters and settingThe main cast ofODST.
Taking place in theKenyanport city ofNew Mombasa,ODSTfollows asquadof eliteMarineOrbital Drop Shock Troopersduring theCovenant invasion of EarthonOctober 20, 2552. Knocked off course due to theMombasa Slipspace Incident, these five ODSTs, accompanied by anONIofficer, fight through the waste-filled, destroyed streets in order to link up with each other, evade theCovenant, and execute a top secret mission.
The game occurs directly after the events of theHalo 2levelMetropolis, when theProphet of Regretperforms aslipspace jumpin New Mombasa.
GameplayVISR ModeODSThas the main protagonist,Rookie, searching for beacons across the city of New Mombasa after he awakens from being knocked unconscious six hours earlier when his pod crash-landed on the surface.
[8]It is up to the player on how to get to any specific location, and in any order, giving a very open-world feeling to the game; this addresses an issue of linear gameplay style for which the main trilogy has been criticized. The "beacons" are various objects, each linked to a particular squadmate in some way. Finding one of these objects puts the player in the shoes of one of the Rookie's five squadmates (Edward Buck,Veronica Dare,Taylor "Dutch" Miles,Kojo "Romeo" Agu, andMichael "Mickey" Crespo), filling in the blanks for the player as to what has happened to the rest of the squad.
[8]Once you go back in time for a short period, you will take control of the player for a single mission, and play the situations that the particular character went through. Unlike the overall game, these flashback scenes go along the path of the linear gameplay that has been common throughout the original trilogy ofHalo.
Due to the fact that you are playing as anOrbital Drop Shock Trooper, you do not use the motion tracker or the shielding featured in theMjolnir Powered Assault Armor, instead using the more traditional health bar/medkit system. The Rookie and his squadmates are not able to dual-wield weapons, such as theM7/Caseless Submachine Gunand theType-25 Directed Energy Rifle. They also cannot useequipment.
On the other hand, the player receives a helmet-integrated data management system known as theVisual Intelligence System, Reconnaissance(or VISR), which includes a low-light vision mode which identifies allies and enemies through the HUD on his helmet's visor by illuminating and classifying objects; green outline for allies, red outline for enemies, blue for scavengable weapons, vehicles, ammo and grenades, and a thick yellow outline for important objects. Outlines of scenery and objects that will block weapons-fire have a thinner yellow outline. The VISR can also be used to manage waypoints, mission objectives, and information which will help the player. The squad has two new weapons, theM7S Submachine Gunand theM6C/SOCOM, which the protagonist and most of his comrades land with in Mombasa during the initial drop. Also, the grenade limit has been increased to 3 per grenade type.
As stated by Bungie in the January 23rd Weekly Update, theSangheilido not appear as enemies inODST.
[9]Although, several groups ofSangheilicorpses are found throughout the campaign, apparently killed by Brutes. By December 2008, the game was "representational," meaning that players could experience the game from start to finish, albeit in an unfinished state. The entire Bungie staff was pulled from other duties to play through the game and offer feedback. Among the unfinished elements was the lack of finished dialogue delivered by voice actors; storywriterJoseph Statenfilled in placeholder audio.
[10]Bungie's audio directorMartin O'Donnellcontributes music forODST, as he has done for the previousHalogames. Due toODST's shift to a new protagonist, O'Donnell created new music that was an homage toHalo, though it was taken in a new direction.
[11]CampaignOpening ScrollShown after theBungieandMicrosoft Game Studioslogos, and before the main menu, is an opening scroll.
Humanity is at war with the alien alliance known as "The Covenant."We are losing.
The Covenant have burned our worlds, killing billions in their genocidal campaign.
Earth is our last bastion - a carefully guarded secret.
But not anymore.
A Covenant carrier has breached Earth's defenses and attacked the African mega-city, "New Mombasa."Initial reports confirm major damage and heavy civilian casualties.
Now military leaders of the "United Nations Space Command" have prepared their response...
Teams of highly-trained "Orbital Drop Shock Troopers" are ready to assault the carrier from Navy ships in low orbit.
This is a near-suicidal mission.
But these troopers are the best of the best.
And saving New Mombasa could be the most important mission of the war...
The DropGunnery Sergeant Buck and Captain Dare arguing.
The game begins at around 4:00pm,October 20th, 2552. The majority of anODSTsquadare preparing for the mission on board theUNSCSay My Nameorbiting high aboveNew Mombasa,Kenya. They are grouped around a holo-table, which shows theCovenantProphet of Regret'sCAS-class assault carrierhovering near the city'sOrbital Elevator.
Corporal Taylor "Dutch" Miles,Lance Corporal Kojo "Romeo" Agu, andPrivate First ClassMichael "Mickey" Crespoare gathered around the holo-table. TheLance Corporal "Rookie"is asleep in the back of the room.
Romeo jokingly remarks how theUNSC Navymanaged to put up a fight during theInvasion of Earth, but still allowed a Covenant carrier to slip by theOrbital Defense Platformssurrounding the planet. Dutch criticizes Romeo, stating that the navy left the lone ship for theMarinesto infiltrate. The ODSTs are soon put on alert when their team leader,Gunnery SergeantEdward Buck, enters the room with an attractiveONIoperative namedVeronica Dare. Romeo utters "Hello, beautiful" in response to Dare's appearance, catching Buck's attention and prompting him to order the ODSTs to theirSOEIV "drop pods".
While walking to the nearby armory, Buck is stopped by Dare, who remarks that the members of his squad are replacements. Buck acknowledges the problem, but notes that after 27 years of war with the Covenant, very few veterans are left in the UNSC. Conflicted about what she likely told him prior to entering the room, Buck confronts Dare about the objective of his team, stating the Assault Carrier (carrying the Prophet of Regret) is a more vital concern than her covert mission. Dare reminds him that they have orders to follow, and that she should be referred to as "Captain," in keeping with military regulations.
Buck directs the Captain to her pod, where Romeo asks about her; obviously angry about the mission, Buck confronts the curious Lance Corporal, replying that she is their "new boss." He gives a short speech to his men to motivate them for the drop, and hands aSRS99D Sniper Rifleto Romeo, drawing questions from the squad, who were anticipating a close range battle inside the Covenant Assault Carrier. While en route to his own drop pod, Romeo rudely awakens the Rookie, hitting him with the butt of his rifle (at which point the camera changes to a first-person view) while the Rookie lies asleep in his pod. Dutch pushes Romeo out of the way and hands the Rookie asilenced SMG, telling the ODST to relax despite Romeo's obnoxious behavior; the Rookie's pod is then closed, spun around, and lowered into the launch bay to begin drop preparations.
The Rookie approaches the Assault Carrier.
Marine forces are informed by Dare that theCovenant Armyis massing beneath the Assault Carrier for an organized retreat. Dozens of ODSTs are launched into Earth's atmosphere in a coordinated drop to infiltrate and capture the Prophet of Regret aboard the Assault Carrier. They pass by a few destroyedFrigatesin orbit around the elevator, and begin to enter cloud cover above the city. The Captain then orders the squad to adjust their trajectory and drop locations; sending the ODST's way off of their intended course.
Before the ODST's are able to deploy their internal parachutes, however, Dutch picks up a radiation alert in his pod, and the Assault Carrier proceeds to enterSlipspace, closely followed by theStalwart-class light frigateUNSCIn Amber Clad. An EMP emitted by the Slipspace rupture disables the drop pods before they are able to deploy their parachutes; the ODSTs are scattered across New Mombasa. Dare's commandeered squad, farthest away from the Slipspace rupture, manages to survive the fall, but the remaining ODST's aiming for the Carrier are killed in action. During the fall, the Rookie's pod collides with Mickey's pod, sending it out of control. The impact knocks the Rookie unconscious.
The Rookie AwakensThe Rookie emerges from his pod.
Six hours after the drop (10:02pm), the Rookie awakens to the sound of twoPhantomsflying nearby. He soon regains his situational awareness, discovering that his drop pod is lodged in a building at least twenty feet off the ground. With no choice, he jumps out of the pod, and falls to the street, slightly injuring himself when he hits the ground. After combing the area for medical supplies, he heads in to the city to find his squad.
Almost immediately after starting out, the Rookie encounters a few Covenant patrols covering a small area. The Rookie uses his silenced weaponry to eliminate the patrols, after which he is alerted to a ringing data terminal. Upon accessing the terminal, the Rookie is connected to theSuperintendent, a second-generation "dumb"AItasked with maintaining the city's infrastructure. The A.I. provides the Rookie with data that had been previously unlocked by Dare. The Superintendent begins to assist the Rookie, giving him maps, marking notable locations throughout the city, and providing warnings using road signs.
As the Rookie travels throughout the city, he finds clues regarding the fate of his squadmates. When the Rookie finds a clue, the game's perspective shifts to that of the relevant ODST.
Six hours earlier, Buck had landed somewhat safely (if uncomfortably) and made radio contact with Dare, who told him that she had been trapped in her drop pod. With the assistance of Marines in the area, Buck fought his way to her position. Along the way, he noticed a "family feud" within the Covenant, as manySangheiliwere found dead and seemed to have been killed by the Brutes. By the time Buck got to Dare's pod, she was nowhere to be found. Buck noticed aHuragok, and saw that it was holding Dare's helmet in one of its tentacles. Curious, the alien began to examine Buck. Having mistaken its curiosity for hostility, Romeo sniped the inquisitive alien, inadvertently triggering the bomb mounted on its back. The resulting explosion threw the helmet out of sight, although the Superintendent recorded a video showing where it landed. Romeo and Buck regrouped, the former stating his belief that Dare was dead. The Rookie later finds the helmet.
Meanwhile, Dutch landed in the Uplift Wildlife Reserve, where he led aWarthogcharge in an effort to breach Covenant defenses and secure the long-departed carrier's landing zone. Mickey had landed nearby, and stumbled upon retreating Marines from the405th. Mickey used aScorpionto bring the Marines to their rally point: the entrance toONI Alpha Site. There, he and Dutch regrouped and found a desperatepoliceofficer, who was searching for an explosives expert. Mickey, who had originally hoped to dig in at the rally point and wait for backup, was pressed into service, and he and Dutch headed to the ONI Alpha Site with the police officer in tow.
The two ODSTs worked with the officer and several Marines to defend the ONI complex. Dutch and Mickey used explosives to destroy the bridge leading to the base, but the Covenant easily countered by using Phantoms to land troops past the broken bridge. The courtyard was quickly overrun by Covenant forces, prompting the besieged humans to retreat to the structure's interior. The humans are eventually forced to retreat from the building using a police Pelican. As they fled, they destroyed the base using remotely-detonated explosives, preventing the Covenant from using the structure and it's contained information. While in flight, Dutch and Mickey managed to re-establish communication with Buck; they headed to the NMPD Headquarters to pick him up.
Upon arriving and attempting to land on a rooftop to pick up Buck and Romeo, Mickey, Dutch and their NMPD allies are attacked byBanshees, and their Pelican is shot down. Buck and Romeo fight their way across the rooftops of the NMPD HQ to the downed Pelican and their squadmates. There, the four ODSTs usedmissile pods, heavy machine guns, androcket launchersto defend the building from Banshees and Phantoms with landing parties. They were successful in repelling the Covenant assault, but in the process, Romeo was badly wounded by aBrute Chieftain, and their Pelican was damaged and left inoperable.
Buck led the group to Kikowani Station, planning to use the tram system to escape the city, stabilizing Romeo withbiofoamalong the way. Upon arrival, however, the group discovered that the tram tunnels had been flooded. They proceeded to hijack a Phantom and escape the city, fighting their way past enemy Banshees and even aScarabin the process. Along the way, they noticed several CCS-class battlecruisers moving toward the crater left by the Assault Carrier's Slipspace jump. After escaping the city proper, Buck realized where Dare was, and ordered Mickey to turn back and set him down.
Reunited with the TeamMeanwhile, the Rookie, having made his way to the Superintendent's Data Center, finds Captain Dare locked in on sub-level nine. She reveals that her orders were to fight her way to the A.I.'s data center and retrieve the information that had recently been discovered about what lay beneath the city, and deny access to the Covenant. The data center, however, had been infested with an entire hive ofDrones, which in turn were supported by numerous other Covenant forces. She explains that this was why she requisitioned a whole squad for her mission: it would have been suicide to fight these forces alone.
Dare and the Rookie fight their way to the data center, arriving just as the severely damaged Superintendent finally shuts down. Closer inspection of the AI's core by the pair reveals a lone, hiding Huragok. Dare reveals an ONI discovery: the Huragoks were enslaved by the Covenant, and have little love for their overlords. She also reveals that this particular Huragok, named Vergil (due to its absorption of the Vergil subroutine in the Superintendent), has combined it's knowledge with the information possessed by the Superintendent, information that can aid humanity in the war.
The two convinced the Huragok to follow them just as the Covenant arrived; Buck arrives at the same time. They escape the data core and fight though hordes of Covenant troops before reaching an elevator, which takes them to the city's coastal highway. Buck informs Dare and the Rookie that he has his stolen Phantom waiting in the shipyards down the highway. Vergil powers up anElephant; Dare drives, while the Rookie and Buck provide supporting fire from aWarthog, and later, aScorpion.
More Covenant ships enter the city, and the fleet begins toglassthe area in an attempt to uncover the buriedForerunnerPortalto theArk. Buck, having witnessed glassing during theFall of Reach, is particularly disturbed by the sight. A Scarab manages to score a direct hit on the Elephant, damaging it severely and forcing the ODSTs to abandon their vehicles and take cover inside the building entrance to Uplift Wildlife Reserve. Buck orders Mickey to provide extraction instead of waiting for them to arrive.
The ODSTs endure multiple Covenant attacks while waiting for Mickey to arrive. When Mickey and the rest of the squad reach their position, the group boards their captured Phantom, narrowly avoiding a Covenant Carrier's glassing beam.
A month later, AdmiralTerrence HoodgivesSergeant MajorAvery Johnsonclearance to interrogate Vergil on an ONI orbital facility. Dare warns Johnson to be careful. As the two enter the room, they see Vergil toying with the optics for a drone fighter. The squad is clustered around the Huragok, with the Rookie asleep in a corner. Johnson casually tosses his lighter to the delicate (and flammable) creature, much to Dare's alarm, which Johnson ignores. Johnson expresses the mutual loathing that humans and Huragok share towards the Brutes, and appeals to Vergil to help the human cause, stating that "You're (Vergil) gonna tell me exactly what they're looking for. And then, you're gonna help me stop 'em." Vergil raised the lighter, flicked it open, and lit the cigar that Johnson just placed in his mouth, suggesting that this Engineer is friendly and willing to cooperate with the humans.
An additional scene plays upon completing the game onLegendary. TheProphet of Truthis seen in the chamber that houses the Superintendent's core, smiling as more Huragok uncover an extensive Forerunner complex beneath the dirt. There is no clear indication as to whether this structure is part of the previously uncovered portal generator or something else entirely.

TrailersAnnouncementFirst, different screens of areas of New and Old Mombasa come on screen, followed by HEV pods entering the atmosphere. Here you can see the Prophet of Regret's carrier on the right, then it moves behind buildings. The pods come into view as a large explosion (Caused by the Prophet of Regret's carrier entering Slipspace) appears, sending the pods off-course. Then, the Superintendent appears, and shows warning signs and then reboots. All the screens from earlier flash onto the screen, but heavily damaged from the blast. Then, a singleHEVpod falls through the sky, when theHalo 3logo appears. The pod then crashes into the camera and goes black, followed by the words 'Prepare to Drop'.
The second part to the trailer, released on the 8th of October, followed on from this - the Superintendent reinitialized itself, attempting to assess the catastrophic devastation and tries to identify the object that survived. Later, after a CovenantPhantomdropship has passed by, the object opens to revealThe Rookieclimbing out, wielding a modified M7S Caseless Submachine Gun. The ODST narrowly avoids aJiralhanaepatrol, before encountering messages from the Superintendent, presumably leading him to safety.

[31]Upon release, the soundtrack received near-unanimous praise from critics,[32][33][34]and won the Spike Video Game Award for "Best Original Score."[35]ReceptionOn release,ODSTbecame the top-selling Xbox 360 game worldwide. The title received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised the atmosphere, music, and story approach. Critics were divided on whether the relatively short campaign and included extras were enough to justify the full-game price tag.
IGN noted that playing on co-op during the campaign ruined the atmosphere of the game, and that the campaign went into "simple shooting galleries" too often. However, they praised the Firefight addition.
[46]Gamepro called it the "best Halo game yet," but mentioned that if the flashbacks were played in a random order, the story did not transition as smoothly. They also stated that the marine A.I. had "major issues" in the game.
[47]Team Xbox stated that it was the "same game at heart, and Firefight mode is an enhanced version of a game type that others have done before." Others mentioned that other games, such asCall of DutyandGears of War, had much better graphics thanODST, which was based on the olderHalo 3engine.
