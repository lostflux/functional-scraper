[11][12]ContentsCampaignPlotHalo: Reachtakes place on the UNSC fortress world ofReachduring the weeks prior toHalo: Combat Evolved.
Noble Team, a squad ofSpartansupersoldiers, is ordered byColonelUrban Hollandto investigate the sudden loss of transmission from theVisegrád Relay Communications Outpost. ExpectingInsurrectionists, the team is baffled to discover that it is the work of theCovenant, and an invasion becomes apparent. As the Covenant begin theirassault on the planet, the UNSC begin their heroic yet hopeless attempt to halt the brutal alien invaders. Soon after, Noble Team is deployed to "Sword Base," an installation belonging to theOffice of Naval Intelligence(ONI), for defensive purposes.
Dr. Catherine Halsey, mastermind of theSPARTAN-II Programand theMjolnir Powered Assault Armorworn by all SPARTAN characters, informs Noble Team that the Covenant at the relay, including a Field Marshal, were searching for important information pertaining to theCovenant religion.
As the Covenant arrive on the planet in force, Noble Team is dispatched on various defensive missions such as assaulting a Covenant ground base and removing fortified Covenant defenses. One of these defenses was a Spire transporting Covenant forces onto Reach. Noble Five's (Jorge) and Noble Six's mission was to take down the shields protecting the Spire. After Noble Six brought down the shield of the Spire, thefrigateUNSCGraftondestroys the Spire withMAC Rounds. When a massivesupercarrierjoins the fight and destroysUNSCGrafton, Kat comes up with a plan to strike back at the Covenant. Her idea is to sneak aSlipspace Bombonto theArdent Prayerwhich they would then send on a refueling run to thesupercarrierto activate the bomb. Six infiltrates the Corvette, while Jorge got the Pelican to dock with the supercarrier and then detonate the makeshift slipspace bomb, but when the detonator malfunctions, Jorge sacrifices himself to destroy the carrier; soon thereafter a larger Covenant fleet arrives to continue the assault. Six is thrown out of the corvette by Jorge to fall back unto the planet Reach. Six lands near New Alexandria, which is already besieged by the Covenant. Noble Six regroups with the rest of the team in assisting with the evacuation of the planet. Then, Noble Six was assigned to destroy Covenant jammers in the skyscrapers of New Alexandria. During their escape, Kat is killed by a field Marshal and New Alexandria is glassed by the Covenant.
Colonel Holland recalled Noble Team to Sword Base to destroy the data that the Covenant are looking for underneath the base, along with the artifacts the Covenant want to get their hands on. They soon meet Halsey and she shows them an ancientForerunnerartifact that she believes is key to winning the war. Noble Six, Carter, andEmileare entrusted with the task of transporting the artificial intelligence,Cortana, and the information she carries regarding the artifact to theUNSCPillar of Autumn. Meanwhile, Jun is assigned to evacuate Halsey in a Pelican dropship. Charges are detonated in the artifact, ultimately destroying it and any evidence of its information.
During the journey to thePillar of Autumn's dry dock, Carter is hit by Banshee fire and is mortally wounded. Six and Emile jump out of the Pelican and slide down to safety. After they fight out of many caves, they encounter a Scarab, which attempts to kill the Spartans. Carter sacrifices himself and the team's Pelican to destroy the Scarab. Finally, Six and Emile reach the ship breaking yards. Emile takes control of a MAC cannon to defend the Autumn while Captain Jacob Keyes arrives to receive Cortana from Noble Six. Emile is slain by Elite Zealots, and Six kills them and the Field Marshal and opts to remain on Reach and take Emile's place at the gun while the Autumn escapes. The game depicts the opening scene ofHalo: Combat Evolved, in which Cortana discoversInstallation 04, followed by the credits and a personal message of thanks from Bungie.
The post-credits scene puts the player in control of Noble Six's last stand against overwhelming Covenant forces. After sustaining more and more damage, Six's helmet cracks. Six eventually casts aside the helmet and is eventually overwhelmed by a group ofSangheili. Six's shattered helmet is left discarded on the ground in a shot that mirrors the game's opening scene. Over thirty years later, the same helmet rests on the grassy plains of a now-rejuvenated Reach. Life has returned, and recolonization has begun. A narration by HalseyeulogizesNoble Team's sacrifice, which enabled the victory over the Covenant.

Characters and SettingHalo: Reachtakes place in the year2552, during theCovenantinvasionof theHumancolony worldReach, which serves as the main military center of theUNSC. The game followsNoble Team, a six-man special operations unit of oneSPARTAN-IIand fiveSPARTAN-IIIcommandos. The player assumes the role of the team's latest member,SPARTAN-B312or "Noble Six" and will be defending Reach from its ultimate downfall at the hands of the Covenant forces.
[13][14]Over the course of the campaign, the players will visit various locales on and above planet Reach which includes remote civilian homesteads, high-tech ONI facilities such asSword Base, the metropolitan city ofNew Alexandria, as well as a segment of space combat in aSabrefighter.
[15]The player will also encounter indigenous creatures such as theMoaand theGúta.
CharactersLocationsSpeciesOrganizationsEventsGameplayA gameplay preview of Noble Six and Noble Team questioning a civilian.
Halo: Reachfeatures many new additions toHalowhile still retaining the core gameplay. The player damage system is similar to that ofHalo: Combat EvolvedandHalo 3: ODST. TheHUDhighlights environmental features and overlay information about them, and themotion sensordisplay is three-dimensional.
Halo: Reachalso introduces a refinedequipmentsystem known as "Armor Abilities." Pieces of equipment can now be selected upon respawning (or picked up off the ground for certain gametypes and campaign); armor abilities are reusable with a recharge time between uses. A newassassinationsystem is also featured, in which holding down the melee button will trigger a context-sensitive, third-person assassination animation. Simply hitting the melee button allows for the old-instant-kill assassination.
The weapon selection has been streamlined from that ofHalo 3, so that every weapon has a specific role. The number of different grenade types has also been reduced from that ofHalo 3, andincendiary grenadesandspike grenadesdid not return. Human weapons all hit more or less instantly after pulling the trigger, giving them a more powerful feel. There is no longer dual-wielding available inHalo: Reach, following the same path asHalo 3: ODST. Compensating for this, the weapons that were known as dual weapons inHalo 3that are now inHalo: Reachbecame drastically stronger. The M6G Magnum, for example, is now almost as powerful as the M6D Pistol inHalo: CE, and has an even higher rate of fire.
Players are able to personalize their character's armor with a greater variety of customization options, and the appearance will be consistent across campaign and multiplayer, unlike inHalo 3where it would only be seen during multiplayer matches. Like inHalo 3, the armor permutations are only to be cosmetic and will not affect gameplay. The design of multiplayer models inHalo: Reachdiffers than those previously used inHalo 3; players are limited to a SPARTAN multiplayer model but given the option of changing their character's gender. Players are given the option to play as an Elite multiplayer model, though only in specific gametypes such as Firefight Versus, Invasion and other Elite-specific gametypes. Both multiplayer models have different gameplay properties; the Elite multiplayer model is physically superior, has a fully recharging health and faster shield regeneration than their SPARTAN counterpart. Overall, their only disadvantage is their massive size which makes them much more noticeable targets. This gives the SPARTANs the advantage of being more nimble and tougher to hit, especially with headshots.
CampaignThe campaign inHalo: Reachconsists of eleven levels, ten of which are playable.
While the rest of Noble Team accompany the player for most of the game,Halo: Reachdoes not feature any kind of tactical squad mechanic. Much like theArbiterThel 'VadaminHalo 3, the rest of the squad will fight alongside the player, but will not interact with the player, other than certain scripted actions and dialogue. The levels will be more open and teleportation in co-op will be far less strict.
[23][24]A small section of theHalo: Reachcampaign levelLong Night of Solaceinvolves space combat, a new element to the game. This space battle above Reach is the first space combat level played in the saga.
[25][26]MultiplayerA total of seventeen multiplayer maps are available inHalo: Reach, with nine standard multiplayer maps and eight Firefight maps.
DefaultNoble Map PackDefiant Map PackAnniversary Map PackMatchmakingHalo: Reach's matchmaking allows players to compete with each other over the Xbox Live online service or System Link, for 16 players on the Xbox. The matchmaking system has been improved and redesigned fromHalo 3; instead of having experience and rank as two separate features,Halo: Reachcombines these two into a credit system where the player is scored on how well they play in each individual performance, instead of a win/loss system. As players gain credits, they achieve highermilitary rank, and are able to buyarmor permutationsto customize their SPARTAN and Elites character model. A new matchmaking system called theArenais introduced for hardcore/competitive players where they will play in month-long seasons and be put into divisions of either Onyx, Gold, Silver, Bronze or Iron, depending on how well they play. Along with this, Campaign also has matchmaking support as well.
[27]Players are able to vote on which Campaign mission to play, similar to how voting works in competitive Matchmaking.
[28]The multiplayer mode features standard multiplayer gametypes such asSlayer,Capture the FlagandKing of the Hill, as well as reintroducingRace, a gametype that was once made exclusive only toHalo: Combat Evolved.
Firefightmode, a cooperative gameplay mode that was made present inHalo 3: ODST, is featured inHalo: Reachwith much more customizable features, from the skulls that turn on every round to the very enemies the player will face every wave, as well as having Matchmaking support.
Halo: Reachalso introduces new gametypes to multiplayer such asInvasion,Stockpile, andHeadhunter. The character models inHalo: Reachdiffers significantly than their previous architecture inHalo 3; both character models are now composed of differenthitboxesand have different gameplay properties. The Elite character models are formidably larger, and physically superior, having faster shield regeneration and the ability to regain health fully over time than their SPARTAN counterpart. SPARTANs are smaller and weaker than their Elite counterpart and would only regain health to thirds over time unless they pick up a health pack. For these balancing issues, only specific gametypes in matchmaking allow SPARTANs and Elites to face each other in team-based games.
FeaturesVehiclesAll civilian vehicles are drivable in the Campaign, but not in multiplayer.
UNSCNon-UsableCovenantNon-UsableEquipmentWeaponsUNSCCovenantDevelopmentReachhas been in development since the completion ofHalo 3, in the tradition of a full three-year cycle and will use a completely new game engine created specifically for the game. It was confirmed in October 2009 thatMartin O'Donnell, Bungie's lead composer, had begun casting voice actors forReach.
[35][36]TheHalo: Reach Multiplayer Beta, used to gather information and tweak gameplay features in the game, ran from May 3 through May 20, 2010. TheZero-bug releasemilestone inHalo: Reach's development was reached on June 24, 2010,[37]and the game's audio, including soundtrack, voices and sound effects, was finished on July 15, 2010.
[38]As of August 5, 2010,Halo: Reachhas"gone gold", meaning all development of the game has been completed and mass manufacturing of the game has begun.
[39]The game was released on September 14, 2010 as planned.
DesignBungie has taken a new design direction withHalo: Reach, aiming for a more somber and gritty atmosphere. The more serious tone is also reflected in camera angles; instead of long, sweeping shots, the cinematic camera angles are actually made to look as if shot with actual cameras.
In many ways, the character designs, especially those ofSangheiliand human personnel, harken back toHalo: Combat Evolved. Models for enemies and allies boast remarkable levels of new detail in form of higher-resolution textures and more polygons. Enemies and allies will have more individual features to denote ranks and provide more visual variety, such as each soldier having an individual name tag in their BDUs.
[40]Bungie made an effort to make the Covenant feel more alien and threatening; for example, the Covenant will speak in their own languages instead of English.
EngineBungie is using a completely reworked version of the engine, with no component left untouched.
[41]The environments, while larger than in the previous games, are far more detailed. The graphical effects have been drastically improved, allowing for a new atmospheric effects system and more dynamic lighting for dramatic shadows and moving light sources in interiors. The engine was improved with an upgraded level of detail system, allowing for larger environments to be rendered compared to previousHalogames, transitioning to more detailed textures and models when moving closer.
[41]Rain and fogging effects are also improved.
Halo: Reachalso features a new animation system, which smoothly blends movement between standing, walking and running as well as jumps, grenade throws and firing. The facial animation system has been completely revamped, including motion capture. Weapon effects are amplified to be more powerful and visceral than before, giving them a more serious tone. Human weapons will sound more powerful and emit smoke and showers of sparks. Plasma bolts now burn through material as they hit, and explosions will throw clouds of dirt and debris around.
Halo: Reach's engine is able to support up to 60 active AI characters on screen at once, twice as many as inHalo 3. In addition, AI has level of detail as well - distant battles between AI characters follow automated behavior models, which convert into scripted behaviors as the player gets closer, and finally convert to full AI.
[41]AudioA more serious and realistic approach has been taken in the audio design ofHalo: Reachthan in the previousHalogames. The music ofReachwas referred to as being more somber and more visceral, as the plot is more character-driven than previousHalotitles and that it focuses on a planet known to have fallen.
[42]As of now, it has been stated that theHalo Themewill not be heard in the game, but there is some foreshadowing ofHalothemes.
[23][24]The in-game effects such as weapon sounds have also been amplified to sound more powerful and realistic. In addition to various different audio filters for interiors and exteriors, the space environment in the levelLong Night of Solacerequired an entirely new audio filter to make the environment feel more realistic.
[43]A significant improvement in the game's audio technology allows for more fluid transition between different layers of music; whereas the first Halo could barely manage more than two layers of music at once,Reachcan run seven layers at once, coordinating which ones fade in and out based on relatively minor changes in the player's behavior.
[44]The audio effects for Halo: Reach were tested in anAudio Testing Environmentto find the suitable locations to be put in the actual game. It was announced by Bungie that theHalo: ReachOriginal Soundtrackwould be released on September 28, 2010.

[60]Release and ReceptionHalo: Reachreceived highly critical acclaim. 1Up praised the campaign, calling it "a grand re-telling of the Battle of Thermopylae, but portrayed from a gritty, ground-level perspective across multiple missions like Band of Brothers, and all done with typical Halo flourish.
[71]IGN noted that though the past games had repetitive landscapes and complicated plots,Reachwas an altogether different matter.
[72]Gamepro stated "the only thing missing from this impressive entry is a number “4” in the title, because for all intents and purposes, Reach feels like the next big thing in the Halo franchise."[73]Many reviewers praised the enhanced graphics and audio, calling it "top-notch." Others mentioned that the checkpoints were flawed, with some too far between, and others leaving the player at a major disadvantage. GamersHell calledReachthe "ultimate multiplayer suite," but critiqued the acting, calling it "abrasive, cliched and campy."[74]Microsoft listed Reach as an Xbox Live Marketplace download on August 12, 2010, at a price of 99999 Microsoft Points (~US$1250); A spokesperson confirmed the download was for media review purposes, and that there were no plans to distribute the game to the public through Games on Demand.
