AI could be one of humanity’s most useful inventionsOur storyWe’ve always been fascinated by human intelligence – it shaped the modern world we live in today.
Intelligence allows us to learn, imagine, cooperate, create, communicate, and so much more. By better understanding different aspects of intelligence, we can use this knowledge as inspiration to build novel computer systems that learn to find solutions to difficult problems on their own.
Like the Hubble telescope that helped us look deeper into space, these tools are already expanding human knowledge and making positive global impact. Our long term aim is to solve intelligence, developing more general and capable problem-solving systems, known as artificial general intelligence (AGI).
Guided by safety and ethics, this invention could help society find answers to some of the world’s most pressing and fundamental scientific challenges.
Where we beganWhen we started DeepMind in 2010, there was far less interest in the field of AI than there is today.
To accelerate the field, we took an interdisciplinary approach, bringing together new ideas and advances in machine learning, neuroscience, engineering, mathematics, simulation and computing infrastructure, along with new ways of organising scientific endeavour.
We achieved early success in computer games, which researchers often use to test AI. One of our programs learned to play 49 different Atari games from scratch, just from seeing the pixels and score on the screen. Our AlphaGo program was also the first to beat a professional Go player, a feat described as a decade ahead of its time.
LeadershipDemis Hassabis co-founded DeepMind in 2010 after successful careers in academia and computer game development. A child chess prodigy, he designed and programmed the multi-million selling, award-winning game Theme Park at the age of 17. After graduating from Cambridge University, he founded pioneering videogames firm Elixir Studios and completed a PhD in cognitive neuroscience at UCL. The journal Science listed his research on imagination and memory as one of 2007’s top ten breakthroughs. Demis is a Fellow of the Royal Society, Royal Academy of Engineering and the Royal Society of Arts. In 2017 he featured in the Time 100 list of most influential people, and in 2018 he was awarded a CBE for services to science and technology.
Demis is also Founder and CEO of Isomorphic Labs.
Shane Legg and Demis first met at the Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit at University College London, while studying the brain’s algorithmic organisation. Their shared curiosity in AI’s potential to positively impact society later became the founding idea for DeepMind. Shane is a celebrated computer scientist and holds a PhD from IDSIA (Dalle Molle Institute for Artificial Intelligence Research) in Switzerland, where he was supervised by Professor Marcus Hutter, the leading authority on theoretical models of super intelligent machines. Shane’s doctoral thesis on universal artificial intelligence was awarded the Canadian Singularity Institute research prize in 2008.
Lila blends technical expertise with creative leadership in her role asDeepMind’s COO. Originally a microprocessor engineer, she has helped grow some of the world's leading technology companies including Intel, where she held a series of global roles, venture firm Kleiner Perkins and Coursera, where she was the first executive hire and helped bring education to millions of people around the world. At DeepMind, Lila oversees both technology and organisational infrastructure includingEngineering,Operations, and People. She is the co-founder and Chair of education technology non-profitTeam4Techand has previously served on the Board of Gannett, helping it become the largest US print media company. Her exceptional impact has been recognised by a Henry Crown Fellowship from the Aspen Institute and the Anita Borg Institute Award for Social Impact.
Koray is one of the world's foremostexperts in deep learning. As Vice President of Research, he oversees and coordinates the work of our international team of research scientists and engineers. He previously led the deep-learning team at DeepMind, where he pioneered algorithmic breakthroughs includingDQN,IMPALAandWaveNet, which powers the voice of the Google Assistant for millions of users around the world. Before joining DeepMind, Koray was a researcher atNEC Labs America. He holds a masters in aerospace engineering and a PhD in computer science from NYU, where he was part of Yann LeCun’s group within theComputational and Biological Learning Labworking on unsupervised learning and deep learning.
Decades of international commercial experience and deep technical expertise mean Colin is uniquely placed to ensure DeepMind’s cutting-edge research benefits as many people as possible. As Chief Business Officer, he oversees a wide-range of teams includingApplied, which applies research breakthroughs to Google products and infrastructure used by billions of people. He also helps drive the growth of DeepMind, building and leading critical functions including finance and strategy and leading external and commercial partnerships. Originally an electronics and software engineer, he has held senior positions at both start-ups and global companies such as Thomson Reuters, helping them solve their own complex, mission-critical, real-world challenges.
TeamsAccess to scienceOpportunities for early-career researchersThe DeepMind Academic Fellowship Program provides an opportunity for early-career researchers in the fields of Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence to pursue postdoctoral study and build the experiences and research profile that will enable them to progress to full academic or other research leadership roles in future.
Alongside financial support, DeepMind provides opportunities for fellows to be mentored by senior DeepMind researchers. DeepMind will not direct their research and fellows are free to pursue any research direction they wish.
Fellowships are open to early-career researchers who have completed a PhD in Machine Learning, Computer Science, Statistics or another relevant field by the time they start their postdoc. We particularly encourage candidates who identify as Black to apply because this group is currently underrepresented in AI research.
DeepMind has partnered with three UK universities to launch the Fellowship program. For a detailed eligibility criteria, including how to apply, check out our partner university websites or email the contacts provided.
Supporting university teachingMany on our team hold university professorships and teach or supervise students at Cambridge, Oxford, MIT, Imperial, and elsewhere. Learn more about these courses on ourYouTube channelorLearning resources page.
We also partner with many world-leading academic institutions to extend research and teaching capacity. So far, we’ve established academic chairs in machine learning at theUniversity of Alberta,UCL, and theUniversity of Cambridge.
Scholarships to open the field of AIDeepMind established our scholarships programme in 2017 in an effort to help build a stronger and more inclusive AI community, who can bring a wider range of experiences to the fields of AI and computer science. The scholarships provide financial support to students from underrepresented groups seeking to study graduate courses relating to AI and adjacent fields. Scholars are also offered support from a DeepMind mentor, and have opportunities to attend leading AI academic conferences and DeepMind events.
Inspiring the next generationOur dedication to science makes us who we are. That’s why we partner with charities likeChess in Schools and CommunitiesandIn2Science, and have become founding partners of theDeep Learning Indaba in Africa, theEastern European Machine Learning Summer School, and theAI4Good Summer Labin Canada. We also offer internship programmes for students who want to gain industry experience.
Strengthening communitiesWe firmly believe that everyone should feel able to participate in science and we are committed to supporting organisations that create community and advance diversity within the sector. Our team members regularly dedicate their time and expertise to advancing discussions about AI in their communities and we are proud partners of theAnita Borg Foundation,Women in Machine Learning,Black in AI, and more.
