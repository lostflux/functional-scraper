SearchAbout UsWho are we?Bot Populi is an alternative media platform dedicated to looking at all things digital from a social justice and Global South perspective. It was founded in 2018 by seven global, digital justice organizations.
What do we do?Digital technologies have been the transformative force of the 21st century, changing the way we live, work, and interact. Those who control data mark and mediate our social location in society. They also decide who is included and excluded from the digital ecosystem. Data, and the digital intelligence harvested from it, are today the purveyors of destiny. As data-based systems become the basis of development, important questions about justice and rights emerge.
We explore these questions about the ways in which the digital world affects different aspects of our lives — in obvious and unexpected ways — through articles, podcasts, and videos. Our contributors include passionate and committed scholars, activists and visionaries from around the world working on issues of digital justice.
Our goalWe aim to meaningfully shape the public discourse on digitalization. In the process, we seek to influence the norms, rules, and practices that contribute to transformative change.
