Carin Watson﻿Imagine an optimistic post-COVID world, where self-reliant neighborhoods (around clean water, renewable energy, organic food production and circular nutritional flows) are designed, defined and autonomously operated by artificial intelligence and machine learning, as a means to maximize regenerative resiliency for the benefit of nurturing residents long-term healthy and happy longevity.
Focus:We will explore the building blocks for tapping into the bold and progressive commitments of systemic green transition funding, estimated to be in the trillions of dollars/euros – and how best to bring these solutions forward rapidly for replication across climate zones and globally for the benefit of humanity living within nature and not separate from it.
Around the world, the pandemic has tested education systems, students and teachers. But these challenges also offer the chance to rethink the ways we can enable young learners. How can we re-imagine what K12 learning can be in the future, and how can technology help that to become a reality? In this rapid-fire session, Victoria Basma of WISE in Qatar will guide a conversation with Nicolas Sadirac of Ecole 42, Julia Freeland Fisher of the Clayton Christensen Institute, and Daniel Pardy of the Qatar Foundation to explore how K12 learning can enter into a new era.

Quantum Computingis the quintessential exponential technology: the advances in this new form of computing could offer a utopia in medicine, machine learning, and cybersecurity. The dystopian counterpart to these include hacking from hostile governments or corporations, AI surveillance, and bioengineered weapons. There are already several groups poised to build quantum computers powerful enough to benefit from these advances, but this means such power is confined to a small minority. It is expected that within five years there will be widespread adoption of quantum technologies, thus the time to understand and adapt is now.

Since COVID-19 has shown us that the speed with which individuals and organizations must adapt has increased exponentially, we need a new model of learning based on a deep understanding of human skills. Join two CEOs of talent-development companies, Ronit Avni of Localized and Jacob Hsu of Catalyte, in a conversation with SU's Chair for the Future of Work, Gary A. Bolles, to learn how cracking the code on human skills can help you and your organization to stay ahead of the curve.
We're seeing major shifts in global markets, and purpose is moving closer to the core of profitability. In this virtual salon, we'll discuss:Featuring Elizabeth Funk, Ariana Gomez, Morgan Brady and Chipp NorcrossStudies have shown that the majority of people don't learn from their failures. Instead, these lessons are buried beneath our egos. In this salon we sit down with Tim Sanders, author, speaker, and VP of Customer Insights at UpWork, to learn how to create a growth mindset that fuels lifelong learning. We'll cover tips for retraining your own mindset, how to help others, and why this practice is critical for challenging conventional wisdom and saving—not preserving—global education.
Featuring Gary Bolles and Tim SandersAs global learning evolves and education crisis accelerates, what is the role of artificial intelligence? How are AI tools being used today in learning?

Learning ObjectivesBefore we embark on this expedition of learning, let’s consider a metaphor for our journey:Have you heard of the hero’s journey? If you are a fan of epic stories likeStar WarsorThe Lord of the Rings, you most likely are familiar with the concept. The hero’s journey is an archetypal story format also known as “the monomyth”. Many critics have written about the hero's journey, but one of the most famous and oft-quoted critics is Joseph Campbell, author ofThe Hero with a Thousand Faces. A simplified version of this hero’s journey is:Phase 1: DepartureThe Call to AdventureThe hero is called upon to embark on a quest. She or he often encounters mentors or other help as she/he crosses the threshold from ordinary life into adventure.
Phase 2: DiscoveryExploration & ExperimentationThe hero journeys towards the goal meeting challenges and other obstacles along the way. The hero is tested repeatedly. Finally, the hero wins.
Phase 3: TransformationInterpretation & SharingThe hero returns to ordinary life, but she/he is changed from the experience. The hero is now fit for leadership, having survived and conquered all the trials and met the ultimate goal.
