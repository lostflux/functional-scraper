A modern Formula 1 race is a breathtaking display of engineering precision. Yet the popularity of the sport arguably has less to do with the performance of the cars than with the skill and daring displayed by the drivers as they push those cars to the limit. Success on the race track has been a celebrated human achievement for more than a century. Will it now become a similar triumph for artificial intelligence (AI)?Writing inNature, Wurmanet al.
1take a step in this direction by introducing Gran Turismo (GT) Sophy, a neural-network driver capable of outperforming the best human players of the video gameGran Turismo.
Read the paper: Outracing champion Gran Turismo drivers with deep reinforcement learningThe objective in racing is easily defined: if you complete the circuit in less time than your competitors, you win. However, achieving this goal involves a complicated battle with physics, because negotiating the track requires careful use of the frictional force between the tyre and the road, and this force is limited. Using some of that friction for braking, for instance, leaves less force available for rounding a corner.
More specifically, each tyre can produce a frictional force proportional to the vertical force, or load, that connects it to the road. As the car accelerates, the load shifts to the rear tyres, leaving less frictional force for the front tyres. This can induce understeer, in which the steering wheel cannot generate more cornering force and effectively becomes a hand rest as the car ploughs out of the turn. By contrast, when the car brakes, the load shifts to the front of the car. This can lead to oversteer, meaning that the rear tyres lose traction and the car spins. Add in a complicated track topography, and the complexities of tuning load transfer with the suspension of the vehicle, and the challenges of racing become obvious.
To win the race, the driver must choose trajectories that allow the car to stay within these ever-changing friction limits as much as it physically can. Brake too early going into a turn and your car is slow, losing time. Brake too late and you won’t have enough cornering force to hold your desired racing line as you near the tightest part of the turn. Brake too hard and you might induce a spin. Professional racing drivers are eerily good at finding and maintaining the limits of their car, lap after lap, for an entire race.
As complex as the handling limits of a car can be, they are well described by physics, and it therefore stands to reason that they could be calculated or learnt. Indeed, the automated Audi TTS, Shelley, was capable of generating lap times comparable to those of a champion amateur driver by using a simple model of physics2. By contrast, GT Sophy doesn’t make explicit calculations based on physics. Instead, it learns through a neural-network model. However, given the track and vehicle motion information available to Shelley and GT Sophy, it isn’t too surprising that GT Sophy can put in a fast lap with enough training data.
What really stands out is GT Sophy’s performance against human drivers in a head-to-head competition. Far from using a lap-time advantage to outlast opponents, GT Sophy simply outraces them. Through the training process, GT Sophy learnt to take different lines through the corners in response to different conditions. In one case, two human drivers attempted to block the preferred path of two GT Sophy cars, yet the AI succeeded in finding two different trajectories that overcame this block and allowed the AI’s cars to pass (Fig. 1).

Wurmanet al.
1report a neural-network algorithm — called GT Sophy — that is capable of winning against the best human players of the video gameGran Turismo. When two human drivers attempted to block the preferred path of two GT Sophy cars, the algorithm found two ways to overtake them. (Adapted from Fig. 3d of ref. 1.)GT Sophy also proved to be capable of executing a classic manoeuvre on a simulation of a famous straight of the Circuit de la Sarthe, the track of the car race 24 Hours of Le Mans. The move involves quickly driving out of the wake of the vehicle ahead to increase the drag on the lead car in a bid to overtake it. GT Sophy learnt this trick through training, on the basis of many examples of this exact scenario — although the same could be said for every human racing-car driver capable of this feat. Outracing human drivers so skilfully in a head-to-head competition represents a landmark achievement for AI.
The implications of Wurman and colleagues’ work go well beyond video-game supremacy. As companies work to perfect fully automated vehicles that can deliver goods or passengers, there is an ongoing debate as to how much of the software should use neural networks and how much should be based on physics alone. In general, the neural network is the undisputed champion when it comes to perceiving and identifying objects in the surrounding environment3. However, trajectory planning has remained the province of physics and optimization. Even vehicle manufacturer Tesla, which uses neural networks as the core of autonomous driving, has revealed that its neural networks feed into an optimization-based trajectory planner (seego.nature.com/3kgkpua). But GT Sophy’s success on the track suggests that neural networks might one day have a larger role in the software of automated vehicles than they do today.
AI system outperforms humans in designing floorplans for microchipsSo, will the Formula 1 battles between Lewis Hamilton and Max Verstappen give way to contests between GT Sophy variants? After all, the physics ofGran Turismois a close match for real racing cars.
Gran Turismo’s director, Kazunori Yamauchi, even used the video game to find ways of tweaking his real racing car to overcome a recurring problem that he was having when taking a corner at the Nürburgring, a Grand Prix track in Germany that has the nickname The Green Hell (seego.nature.com/3tw22aa). It also helped me to familiarize myself with Laguna Seca Raceway before I started racing school.
Still, some challenges remain in moving from the console to the track. For example, GT Sophy has not yet learnt that it is sometimes better to follow the car ahead to make up time, instead of dogfighting at every corner. Of course, Wurmanet al.
report GT Sophy’s rookie season, and there is no obvious reason why such a strategy could not be learnt with greater experience, too.
More challenging might be the variation that occurs with each lap. Unlike in theGran Turismoraces used by Wurman and co-workers, the condition of the tyres on real racing cars changes from lap to lap, and human drivers must adapt to such changes throughout the race. Would GT Sophy be able to do the same with more data? And where would such data come from? It’s easy to run simulations, but no racing car in existence has completed enough laps to train GT Sophy in its current form, much less an AI that could handle tyre variability. However, there is evidence that neural networks can capture changing vehicle dynamics on different road surfaces2, so perhaps Verstappen and Hamilton should keep one eye on their rear-view mirrors.
