AdvertisementGreenhouse gas emissions from diverse Arctic Alaskan lakes are dominated by young carbonNature Climate Changevolume8,pages166–171 (2018)Cite this article3196Accesses51Citations235AltmetricMetricsdetailsSubjectsAbstractClimate-sensitive Arctic lakes have been identified as conduits for ancient permafrost-carbon (C) emissions and as such accelerate warming. However, the environmental factors that control emission pathways and their sources are unclear; this complicates upscaling, forecasting and climate-impact-assessment efforts. Here we show that current whole-lake CH4and CO2emissions from widespread lakes in Arctic Alaska primarily originate from organic matter fixed within the past 3–4 millennia (modern to 3,300 ± 70 years before the present), and not from Pleistocene permafrost C. Furthermore, almost 100% of the annual diffusive C flux is emitted as CO2. Although the lakes mostly processed younger C (89 ± 3% of total C emissions), minor contributions from ancient C sources were two times greater in fine-textured versus coarse-textured Pleistocene sediments, which emphasizes the importance of the underlying geological substrate in current and future emissions. This spatially extensive survey considered the environmental and temporal variability necessary to monitor and forecast the fate of ancient permafrost C as Arctic warming progresses.

MainLakes are more abundant in the Arctic than in any other region1and emit more CH4than any other natural Arctic source, contributing 6% (16.5 Tg CH4yr−1) to global natural CH4emissions2,3. Current CH4emission estimates from Arctic lakes vary by a factor of two (11.9–24.2 Tg CH4yr−1) (refs4,5,6), and future estimates from all permafrost-region sources span three orders of magnitude7. Discrepancies persist because of uncertain climate projections8and because current lake-C-emission data sets fail to capture the complexity of Arctic-lake types9, specifically, their geological settings10, potential C sources11,12and CH4versus CO2emission pathways13,14.
Approximately 20% of the total lake area in northern permafrost regions formed via thermokarst, in which degradation of ice-rich permafrost results in subsidence, ponding and thaw of the underlying sediments11. The initiation and expansion of thermokarst lakes is sensitive to climate change15, and has been identified as a mechanism for the rapid decomposition of ancient (defined here as ≥11,500 years years before the present (YBP), that is, late Pleistocene and older) permafrost C and its emission to the atmosphere16,17,18. Under a warming climate, there is the potential for an enhanced decomposition and emission of this ancient and vast C reservoir to provide a positive feedback to climate change14. Yet, the ability of thermokarst lakes to act as conduits for permafrost C emissions to the atmosphere as CH4has only been verified in lakes that actively thaw into yedoma, a fine-textured, C- and ice-rich, aeolian sediment of the Pleistocene steppe. These environmental conditions comprise just 12% (150,000 km2) of the landscapes with prevalent lake thermokarst (1,300,000 km2) in the northern circumpolar permafrost region (18,410,000 km2) (refs10,11), and therefore under-represent the environmental diversity of Arctic lakes.
Current estimates of permafrost C loss from lakes are based on age measurements (radiocarbon (14C) dating) of CH4emitted by ebullition (bubbling). Measured ages are highly variable, ranging from 40,000 YBP to modern (C fixed from the atmosphere after 1950) within a single lake16,17,19,21. Ebullition itself is highly sporadic, and daily rates can span three orders of magnitude13,22,23,24. And, although ebullition is probably the primary CH4emission pathway in actively expanding yedoma–thermokarst lakes (79% of the total emissions on average)2,18, diffusive CH4emissions can dominate whole-lake emissions in non-yedoma systems13,25. Furthermore, northern lakes can also be large CO2sources26, but few studies have simultaneously quantified CH4and CO2emissions22,27or their C-source ages28, which leaves an incomplete understanding of the role of lakes in the climate feedback of permafrost C.
Study location and approachThis study quantified whether ancient permafrost or young organic C (OC) dominates whole-lake C emissions from lakes on Alaska’s North Slope, and the proportion emitted as CH4. In our 250,000 km2study region, lakes are a dominant landscape feature29, formed by a variety of processes, which include thermokarst, in a diverse range of geological substrates9. Most of the North Slope remained unglaciated during the most-recent glacial maximum (~27–19 kyr ago) and has accumulated sediments with varying OC30and ice content31. The general surficial geology is delineated by mixtures of marine gravel, sand, silt and clay (coastal-plain geology), glaciomarine deposits near the Beaufort and Chukchi Sea coasts9,32, a 250 × 60 km2zone of aeolian sand further inland33, yedoma-type aeolian silt along the northern edge of the Brooks range34and rivers that flow south to north with floodplain corridors underlain by fluvial sand and glacial outwash (Supplementary Fig.
1).
We quantified the14C age,13C content and concentrations of mass-integrated, whole-lake diffusive CH4and CO2in up to 40 lakes that span seven geological sediment types35, thermokarst and non-thermokarst lake types, and a 3.5 °C gradient in mean annual air temperature (Supplementary Table1). The 40 lakes were studied over two winters (April 2013 and April 2014), and seven were studied during one summer (August 2014). Isotope measurements were made on CH4and CO2dissolved beneath floating ice in late winter, when the majority of any ebullition gas, trapped beneath the ice, would have dissolved into the lake water over the ice-cover season36. We assume that the14C signature of dissolved ebullition gas would alter the whole-lake dissolved14C signature by the principle of mass balance (see equation (8)), and that the below-ice14C signature of dissolved gases represents the mass-integrated value of the whole-lake emissions. Cumulative daily C fluxes for the open-water period were estimated by extrapolating the mean of triplicate dissolved CH4and CO2measurements, made on either a single day (n= 7) or on two days (one week apart) (n= 2) in August 2014, using daily air and water temperature, and daily wind speed. Annual diffusive emissions (g C) of CH4and CO2were estimated for each lake surveyed in the summer by adding an estimate of the springtime ice-out diffusive flux (based on below-ice accumulation) to cumulative daily fluxes from the ice-free period (Table1(Methods)).
We estimated the mean and probable range of ancient permafrost C contributions to the whole-lake emissions of CH4and CO2with a five-source isotope mass-balance model37. Carbon-source categories included C fixed from the atmosphere during 1950–2012 (which represents14C-enriched CO2from nuclear weapons testing), in 2013 (recent photoassimilates), 5,000 YBP (mid-Holocene), 11,500 YBP (end of the Pleistocene) and from14C-free sources (>50,000 YBP) (equation (8)).
Sources of CH4and CO2emissionsAll lakes but one were oversaturated in CH4and CO2(n= 40) (Fig.
1and Supplementary Table2). When an estimate of the ice-out flux is included, we found that all the lakes were sources of C to the atmosphere. Mean daily fluxes were 6.2 ± 3.4 mg CH4m−2d−1and 2,620 ± 2,240 mg CO2m−2d−1(n= 7), and within the range previously reported from North Slope lakes using similar methods27. Total lake-C emissions from the study area were 0.94 ± 0.14 Tg C yr−1(C here is diffusive C-CO2+ C-CH4) (Table1) and C-CO2emissions were over 180 times larger, on average, than C-CH4emissions.

Values are averaged from the 2013 and 2014 winter measurements. Dashed horizontal lines indicate the14C signature of atmospheric CO2in the summer of 2013. Boxes indicate the 25th and 75th percentiles, and error bars are the 10th and 90th percentiles. Solid horizontal lines within boxes indicate the median. Open stars are outliers. Numbers within the parentheses indicate the number of lakes observed in each geological unit. Statistically different groups with respect to mean14C age are indicated by either (i) or (ii) (single-factor ANOVA and Tukey’s HSD post hoc analysis (F(4, 21) = 19.49,P= 7.92 × 10−7) and (F(4, 30) = 10.85,P= 1.46 × 10−5) for CH4and CO2, respectively).
Ages of whole-lake diffusive C emissions were much younger (Fig.
2and Table1) than the age of CH4emitted from yedoma–thermokarst lakes in Siberia and Central Alaska16,17and the age of permafrost C sources (>50,000 to 6,000 YBP)19. Ages ranged from modern to 3,300 ± 70 YBP for dissolved CH4, and from modern to 1,590 ± 20 YBP for dissolved CO2. The lake-category-weighted mean14C ages for the study region were 847 YBP for CH4(n= 49 measurements) and 392 YBP for CO2(n= 68). In all lakes but one, dissolved CH4was on average 40014C-years older than CO2(Fig.
2and Table1). This may reflect a combination of modern atmospheric CO2equilibrating with lake waters, CO2production from the aerobic decomposition of younger organic material produced within lakes and imported from surrounding soils, and methanogenesis being fuelled by older sedimentary and soil C sources. Stable isotope data (δD and δ13C (δ13C = [(13C/12C)sample/(13C/12C)standard] − 1)) of CH4confirmed a microbial CH4origin in our lakes38. In our study, the δ13C of dissolved CH4below ice was −56.7 ± 12.4‰ (n= 16) (Supplementary Table2), which again indicates microbial CH4(δ13C < −50‰) (ref.
39). The14C and13C data both demonstrate that lake-C emissions originated primarily from the degradation of recently formed terrestrial C, such as shallow-lake sediment C and surrounding soil C, rather than fossil C seeping through gaps in the permafrost from near-surface coal beds40or from C in sublake thawed sediments (talik) deposited during the Pleistocene16.
Values, expressed as FM and14C age (YBP), represent the below-ice mean values from April 2013 and April 2014 (n= 2) or either the 2013 or 2014 value (n= 1). Error bars represent the s.d. whenn= 2, or the procedural and analytical error whenn= 1; in either case, the larger of the two is shown. Larger errors for CH4, relative to CO2, represent a combination of greater interannual variability and smaller sample size, for which procedural and analytical errors are more impactful. A greater distance from the 1:1 line indicates a greater14C content (age) difference between CH4and CO2. Values greater than FM = 1 (shaded area) indicate samples that contain C fixed from the atmosphere post calendar year 1950.
Seasonal effects on dissolved CH4and CO2isotopesComparing winters within the same lakes, dissolved CH4was 38% older on average in 2014 than in 2013 (p< 0.05,n= 12); however, we found no difference in the ages of dissolved CO2(p> 0.05,n= 19). Seasonally, the mean age of dissolved CH4in the winter was 18014C-years older than that in the summer (p< 0.05,n= 6), and the mean age of dissolved CO2in the winter was 62014C-years older than that in the summer (p< 0.05,n= 6). The older CO2observed below ice probably reflects a diminished aerobic decomposition of fresh (and young) organic material beneath the ice, and/or limited atmospheric exchange through the ice. We also found strong evidence for the oxidation of CH4into CO2, which could also explain the older below-ice CO2values because CH4was consistently older than the concomitant CO2. The mean14C values of coexisting dissolved CH4and CO2were positively correlated across all the study lakes (r =0.93,p< 0.05,n= 26) (Fig.
2). This relationship implies CH4oxidation in the water column, in which the resulting dissolved CO2carries the14C signature of the oxidized CH4. However, co-production of CH4and CO2with the same14C signature in sediments during acetate fermentation may also be a factor, especially where coexisting CH4and CO2are closer in14C age. If we assume that CH4oxidation is the only factor that alters the14C signature of below-ice dissolved CO2, a two-source14C mass-balance mixing model (which utilizes the previous summer14CO2and winter14CH4values as the end members) can be used to estimate that 60 ± 15% (n= 5) of below-ice dissolved CO2may have originated from oxidized CH4. In support of this hypothesis, we found that below-ice dissolved CH4was enriched in13C in six lakes (δ13C ranged from −39.5‰ to −19.0‰) relative to the common products of methanogenesis (δ13C from −110 to −50‰) (ref.
39). Likewise, significant negative relationships between below-ice dissolved CH4concentrations and δ13CH4in lakes when δ13CH4> −60‰ were also observed (R2= 0.59,n= 4 in 2013, andR2= 0.91,n= 7 in 2014 (p< 0.05)). Both observations are indicative that CH4consumption enriches the13C in residual dissolved CH4in a semiclosed system below ice. Together, these findings support our observations that the dissolved C-CO2pool was four times larger than the C-CH4pool, that below-ice CH4oxidation may age the dissolved C-CO2pool and that within-lake CH4oxidation regulates the global warming impact of Arctic lakes.
Emission ages in relation to geological substrateThe interannual and seasonal variation in mean gas ages for individual lakes was small compared with the age differences observed across geological units (around 160%). Across the North Slope, C-emission ages were clearly related to the surficial geological unit that underlies the lakes (Figs.
1and3). Dissolved CH4and CO2were significantly younger in lakes in sandy and fluvial deposits compared with those in finer-textured coastal, glaciomarine and aeolian silt (yedoma-type) deposits (p< 0.05, Single factor analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey’s honest significant difference (HSD) test and post hoc analysis) (Fig.
1). Mean gas ages in lakes that reside on glacial deposits were not significantly different from gas ages in any other geological unit.
Circles indicate the location of 27 lakes measured for below-ice dissolved14CH4(n= 1−2 per lake). Methane ages were interpolated using inverse distance weighting with a 1/20 weight reduction parameter for predictions in non-similar geology categories (equations (9)–(11)), which gives the effect of pronounced geology boundaries. Major geological boundaries are also emphasized with black lines.

Grey areas represent unobserved geological units.

Sedimentary OCThe geological substrate incorporates sediment texture, and thus the ground ice content, thermokarst behaviour and C-retention properties of the landscape. In contrast with lakes that form in sandy deposits, lakes in finer, ice-rich sediments exhibit a greater post-thaw subsidence, and thus can quickly degrade deeper (and presumably older) permafrost9. Also, as fine-textured Pleistocene aeolian silt on the North Slope sequestered more C, lakes that formed into such deposits have more ancient sedimentary OC available within their taliks for potential decomposition than lakes in sand, given similar thaw depths. We determined that the OC content of aeolian silt (0.95 ± 0.34% OC,n= 38) was relatively OC rich compared with that of the adjacent aeolian sand (0.19 ± 0.10% OC,n= 29) (p< 0.05) (Supplementary Table3). This result is similar to previous reports of the North Slope silt34, yet less than that of other yedoma-type sediments10. The large difference in sedimentary OC observed between sand and silt is also reflected in the five-source isotope model solutions, in which ancient C accounts for an average of 15% of the whole-lake C emissions (CH4plus CO2) from lakes in silt versus 9% from those in sand (Fig.
4and Table1). As finer deposits dominate both ends of our transects, we found no correlation of CH4or CO2age with latitude or mean annual air temperature. Hence, our results demonstrate that local environmental heterogeneity (that is, variable % OC in the substrate) is a better proxy for whole-lake diffusive C-emission ages than is broad climatic regulation on the North Slope.

Regional CH4and CO2fluxesOur regional assessment clearly demonstrates that terrestrial C, fixed from the atmosphere within the past few millennia, is the dominant source of whole-lake C emissions on the North Slope today, and that the current emissions of ancient C are minimal and restricted to lakes that reside in fine-textured sediments (Figs.
1,3and4). The annual diffusive CH4flux extrapolated from all the lakes (total lake area, 10,659 km2) in our study region (231,157 km2) was (5.0 ± 0.8) × 10−3Tg C-CH4yr−1, of which ancient permafrost C sources contribute a mean of 14%, with a range of 0–38% (10th to 90th percentile range of the mixing-model solutions) (Fig.
4and Table1). This is equivalent to an ancient C flux of 7.2 × 10−4Tg C-CH4yr−1(Table1). The total annual diffusive CO2emissions were 0.94 ± 0.14 Tg C-CO2yr−1, with a mean contribution of 11% (range from 0 to 25%) from ancient C (Fig.
4and Table1). Ancient C-CO2emissions (0.10 Tg C-CO2yr−1) were 150 times greater than that via CH4, which implies that CO2diffusion is the dominant pathway for ancient C loss from the North Slope.
Discussion and conclusionEmissions of C to the atmosphere from ancient sources amplify climate warming because they represent a net addition to the active C cycle. Emissions of ancient C were greatest per unit area ((1.7 ± 0.5) × 107g C km−2yr−1) and collectively ((5.7 ± 2.0) × 1010g C yr−1) from the lakes in the coastal plain geology unit (Table1). This is a result of the greater overall lake area (Table1), a higher proportion of ancient C that contributes to the emissions and a relatively older CO2that accounts for a higher proportion of the total diffusive flux (Table1). Recent work suggests that increasing winter water temperatures are preventing lakes in this region from freezing completely in the winter15, which potentially allows aged organic material in newly developing taliks to contribute to greenhouse-gas production.
The ancient C flux was dominated by diffusive CO2emissions (0.10 ± 0.01 Tg C-CO2yr−1, or 99% of the total ancient C emissions (Table1)). Ice-free CH4ebullition was neither directly observed nor estimated in our study. However, if ice-free ebullition represented 79% of the total ice-free CH4emissions (as observed in yedoma–thermokarst lakes2) and was sourced completely from ancient C, cumulative emissions of ancient C via CO2diffusion would still exceed the CH4emissions (diffusion plus the hypothetical ancient ice-free ebullition of 0.02 Tg C-CH4yr−1) in our region by over a factor of four. Nevertheless, in this unlikely scenario the climate-warming potential of ancient C emissions as CH4is far greater than that of CO2, because CH4is 30 times more effective as a net radiative forcer on a molecule-to-molecule basis and on a 100-year timescale41. Ancient C flux as CH4would outweigh the global warming potential of observed ancient C emission via CO2diffusion if ice-free CH4ebullition comprised roughly 70% of the total diffusive CH4emissions in our study lakes ((5.0 ± 0.8) × 10−3Tg–C-CH4yr−1) and was purely sourced from ancient C. This finding emphasizes the need for climate feedback studies of permafrost C to distinguish CH4from CO2emissions and whether each gas is predominantly sourced from ancient or young C.
Our regional-scale assessment provides an important baseline dataset for monitoring the emission sources of CH4and CO2from the climate-sensitive North Slope lakes. It also demonstrates that lakes in Arctic Alaska currently emit CH4and CO2predominantly from C pools that cycle between the land and atmosphere on timescales of decades to four millennia, even in areas where the lakes are actively eroding into relatively C-rich Pleistocene permafrost. Consequently, the Alaskan Arctic lakes are important systems for processing and returning freshly fixed C back to the atmosphere. Future emissions of ancient C are likely to increase, but our work provides further evidence that they will be restricted to areas in which the combination of warming temperatures, ancient OC and thermokarst favour the development of new or expanding taliks and shorelines18,42. Finally, diffusive CO2emissions from young C sources currently account for nearly all (99%) of gaseous C loss from the North Slope lakes. Our multiyear regional lake survey concludes that future Arctic greenhouse-gas-emission research must consider the complexity of lake-forming processes, the variable geological settings of the entire circumpolar region and whether relatively fresh and young C or decomposing ancient permafrost C dominate the C cycling of Arctic lakes.
MethodsSample collectionWater and dissolved-gas samples were collected from 40 lakes (≥0.27 ha) on the North Slope of Alaska, USA (Supplementary Table1). The lakes are part of the Circum-Arctic Lakes Observation Network (CALON,www.arcticlakes.org). The CALON lakes are distributed along a 'western' and an 'eastern transect that spans 150 and 300 km and is centred along the −156.5° W and −151.9° W parallels, respectively. On each transect, the lakes are divided into 3–8 clusters, which span local lake sizes43. Most lakes are shallow (mean 2.4 m, range 0.5–11.8 m) and probably well mixed. Along each transect, coastal lakes are characterized by cooler summer temperatures and a shorter ice-free period than lakes located further inland44.
For radiocarbon (14C) analyses of dissolved CH4and CO2, the lakes were sampled near their centres twice a year, with and without ice cover, in North Slope lake in 2013 and 2014. During the winter (April) of 2013 the CALON team collected water from below the ice from 19 lakes on the western transect and 17 lakes on the eastern transect, and in the winter (April) of 2014 from 23 lakes solely on the western transect. A hole 25 cm in diameter was drilled with an Eskimo auger (Shark Z51 (Eskimo)) and 1.3 l of water were collected without headspace into Nalgene square polyethylene terephthalate (PETE) media bottles with natural high density polyethylene screw caps (342040-1000 (Thermo Scientific)). As the sample froze, the bottles expanded to accommodate the volume change. Once thawed, the bottles regained their original shape. Samples were frozen in the field and kept frozen until further processing at the University of California (UC) Irvine.
During the summer, samples were collected in surface waters near the centre of each lake using a novel gas-extraction technique with a Liqui-Celpmembrane contactor. Lake water was pumped (1.2 l min−1) for 60 min through a series of four particulate filters (178 and 40 μm stainless-steel mesh filters T-29595-39 and T-2959-35 (Cole-Parmer), and 20 μm and 5 μm 5″ polypropylene sediment depth filters SD-25-0520 Flow-Pro and SD-25-0505 Hydronix (FreshWatersystems)) and past a degassing membrane contactor (Liqui-Cel (Membrana)), in which bulk dissolved gases (including N2, CH4and CO2) were collected in a pre-evacuated, pre-weighed 2 l stainless steel canister with a stainless steel bellows sealed valve (SS-4BG (Swagelok)). To prevent cross-contamination, all the filters were replaced and the system was flushed with lake water for 30 min prior to each sampling event. To prevent microbial activity, the whole system was flushed with dilute H3PO4acid for 10 min and then clean tap water for 15 min daily (after about four samples) and stored dry. This system eliminates the need to store and ship an average of 100 l of water for the extraction of ≥0.1 mg C-CH4, or approximately 10 l for the same amount of C-CO2per sample for14C analysis. At the same time and location, we measured water temperature and pH (PCD 650 (Oakton Instruments)).
During the summer of 2014, the lakes were also analysed for dissolved CH4and CO2concentrations. At the centre of each lake, three replicates of 20 ml of surface lake water were manually injected into capped (blue butyl rubber septa, CLS-4209-14 (Chemglass Life Sciences)) pre-evacuated 40 ml crimp-sealed glass vials over the course of 2 h. The vials were pre-loaded with 20 μl of aqueous mercuric chloride to inhibit microbial activity.
General surficial geological unitsThe descriptions of each general geology unit defined in this work (coastal plain, aeolian sand, aeolian silt, fluvial old, fluvial young, glaciomarine, and glacial young) are already published35.
Laboratory analysesRadiocarbon analysisDissolved gases were extracted from frozen water samples collected during the winter. One day prior to extraction, and when still frozen, the original screw caps on the sample bottles were replaced with septum caps (38–430 Microlink Open Top, Wheaton, custom 1/8″ thick butyl rubber septa (McMaster-Carr)) in a pure N2atmosphere. The sample was then left to thaw at room temperature overnight. Post-thaw, a 15% headspace was created with ultrapure N2(NI UHP300 (Airgas)) in the bottle to produce the most-efficient CH4extraction conditions for CH4(ref.
45) as dissolved CH4is typically in lower abundance than CO2. Dissolved gases were transferred to pre-evacuated, weighed 2 l stainless-steel canisters via headspace extraction.
Canisters that contained the winter and summer samples of dissolved gas were weighed to quantify the mass of dissolved gases collected and then balanced to 1 atm with ultrazero (C-free) air (AI UZ300 (Airgas)). The canister was then connected to a flow-through vacuum extraction line designed to extract sequentially CH4and CO2for14C analysis46. As the sample gas is introduced to the vacuum line, (1) CO2is frozen out in a liquid nitrogen (LN) trap, (2) carbon monoxide is converted into CO2at 290 °C and frozen out in a second LN trap and (3) CH4is oxidized to CO2in a 975 °C furnace with cupric oxide pellets. CH4-derived CO2and sample CO2were purified on the vacuum line, quantified manometrically and converted into graphite using the sealed-tube zinc-reduction method47. Isotopic standards were extracted using the same methods to evaluate the procedural contamination of the sampling methods extraction-line system (see below).
Alongside the procedural and analytical standards and14C-free blanks, which represented all sampling and processing steps (see below), the graphite was measured for its14C/12C ratio with an accelerator mass spectrometer (AMS) at the W.M. Keck Carbon Cycle Accelerator Mass Spectrometer facility at UC Irvine48(equation (1) and Supplementary Table2). For samples >0.2 mg C, an aliquot of the CH4-derived CO2or the sample CO2was analysed for δ13C with isotope-ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) (GasBench II coupled to a Delta plus IRMS (Thermo Fisher Scientific) (Supplementary Table2):Radiocarbon values are reported in FM, which is the14C to12C ratio in the sample relative to that of the oxalic acid-1 standard (OX1) (equation (2)). The measured sample ratio is normalized to a δ13C value of −25‰ to correct for the mass-dependent fractionation of14C (via measuring δ13C simultaneously in the AMS (δ in equation (1)), divided by 0.95 times the activity of OX1 to normalize to the conventional pre-industrial wood standard in 1950, where the OX1 standard is corrected to its actual δ13C value of −19‰ (ref.
49):Mean14C ages reported in YBP (equation (3)), which represents a14C age calculated from the averaged FM values from equation (2):where 8,033 is the mean lifetime of14C, in years, using the Libby half-life of 5,568 years. When calculating mean14C ages, any FM values >1 (indicative of samples that contain 'bomb14C' from post-1950 above-ground nuclear weapons testing) were replaced with 1 (calendar year 1950, FM of OX1) and then averaged across all the study lakes and within the general geology types.
We report14C ages, as opposed to calibrated-calendar ages, because dissolved CH4and CO2represent an open system that exchanges with various other C pools with presumably different14C ages within the lakes’ C cycle. Calibrated-calendar ages only apply to C material in closed systems, in which the radioactive decay of14C is the only flux term. In our case the14C age serves as a tracer for the C source of the dissolved CH4and CO2.
Validation of14C results produced from the sampling methodsAs mentioned above, we developed two methods for sampling dissolved CH4and CO2for C-isotope analysis in relatively high concentration below-ice waters (winter), and in low-concentration open waters (summer). To validate the isotopic data produced from these methods, we conduced laboratory tests to determine whether our methods introduced any measurement bias or extraneous C that would affect the true14C and13C signature of the sampled gases.
Tests of the winter method demonstrated minimal extraneous C and fractionation effects in both CO2and CH4for both14C and13C. The modern14C blank was small and reproducible (~1.5 μg C and 2.5 μg C for CH4and CO2, respectively (Supplementary Fig.
3)). This represents just 0.02% of the average extraction yields for both dissolved CH4and CO2in the winter samples, and had a negligible effect on the measured values after the14C extraneous-mass correction. Additionally, we saw no effect from using the Nalgene PETE bottles, as their14CH4results were indistinguishable from those produced from headspace extractions using glass bottles. Likewise, the replicates of modern-C biogas lab standards (assessment of14C-free C contamination), regardless of the sample size, yielded results within the range of 20 measurements of the biogas standards directly injected and combusted on the extraction line (Supplementary Fig.
3). To test the potential fractionation of13C in CH4and CO2, we also compared the13C results from headspace extractions with those of direct injection and combustion. For the direct injection and combustion of CH4, the δ13C value was −48.32 ± 0.21‰ (n= 3) compared with −48.37 ± 0.07‰ (n= 8) for the headspace extractions—a deviation comparable to the IRMS measurement error (~0.02‰). For the direct injection of CO2, the δ13C value was −5.2 ± 0.07‰ (n= 3), comparable to −5.3 ± 0.48‰ (n= 4) for the headspace extractions, which is also negligible.
We also tested the potential extraneous14C-free C contamination of the Liqui-Cel system (used for low-concentration open waters) (Supplementary Fig.
4). Similar systems using Liqui-Cel membranes have proved successful for minimal and reproducible14C blanks in marine settings, in which much greater volumes of water are degassed50. A recirculation system was built in the lab such that approximately 2 l of ultrapure deionized water (brought to pH ≈ 2 with dilute H3PO4) could be sparged with ultrahigh pressure (UHP) N2and flushed through the system to remove all the ambient gases and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) prior to the injection of modern biogas gas standards (CH4and CO2). Similar to flushing with sample water in the field, the recirculating system was flushed with the N2-sparged acidified water for 30 min, prior to the extraction of dissolved gases. After the flushing period, gas standards were injected into the recirculating water stream via a septa port and extracted through the Liqui-Cel membrane for 1 h (same duration as in the field sampling). Supplementary Fig.
4shows the results from four replications of varying size for CH4and CO2relative to the consensus values for the respective biogas standards. We determined the consistent addition of extraneous14C-free CO2over 1 h to be 25 ± 7.5 μg, which is roughly 3% of the mean mass yield for open-water dissolved CO2samples. For CH4, we determined a smaller extraneous14C-free C effect of 2 ± 1 μg, which corresponds to approximately 2% of the mean mass yields for open-water dissolved CH4samples. We applied these mass corrections and associated errors to all14C data produced from the Liqui-Cel system. As all14C data are also normalized to δ13C = −25‰ during the AMS measurement (see above), any potential mass-dependent fractionation of the Liqui-Cel system or other sample-processing steps is reconciled in the final measurement and irrelevant for reported14C data.
Although we made considerable effort to mirror field sampling, the recirculation system in the lab does not replicate perfectly the open-system sampling in the field. During field sampling, water is not recirculated through the membrane and water filters, but is pumped out of the system and back into the lake, away from the intake. We believe this means our extraneous14C mass correction is conservative and probably overestimated for both CH4and CO2.
Regional mean14C ages for dissolved CH4and CO2emissionsWe estimated the regional mean age of diffusive CH4and CO2(847 and 392 YBP, respectively) emissions using a lake-area-weighted mean. Specifically, the mean age for each gas in each geological unit was weighted by the proportional lake area in that unit to the total lake area.
Dissolved-gas concentration analysisMethane and CO2were analysed by flame-ionization detection using a Shimadzu GC-2014 gas chromatograph (Shimadzu) at the USGS Woods Hole Coastal and Marine Science Center. Prior to analysis, vials that contained the 20 ml water samples were brought to 1 atm by injecting UHP He through the vial septa. The vials were then overpressured slightly by the addition of 3.2 ml He-sparged, low-pH water. Reducing the pH to <2 transferred all the DIC species to the headspace as CO2. After a 2 h equilibration, 3.2 ml of the headspace was removed from the vial. Gas and water exchanges were achieved using Becton-Dickinson plastic syringes and 18-gauge needles (Becton, Dickinson and Co.) connected via a plastic three-way stopcock. The extracted headspace gas was injected into a 22 ml min−1He carrier gas through a gas-sampling valve, and CH4and CO2were separated at 80 °C on a 80/100 mesh HayeSep D (Hayes Separations) (5 m × 1/8 outside diameter) packed column. CO2was analysed as CH4after its reduction with a methanizer. Concentrations of CH4and CO2were determined against Scott Gas certified gas standards (Air Liquide) that spanned the range of observed values. Headspace CH4concentrations were converted into dissolved concentrations using a literature method51. Total DIC, or [DIC]Total, measured in the headspace of the acidified samples, was converted into pCO2(or CO2aq) for use in lake–air gas exchange calculations following the conventions of Stumm and Morgan52:here [H+] is the hydrogen ion concentration based on lake pH andK1andK2are the lake-temperature-adjusted equilibrium constants for the dissociation of H2CO3and HCO3−, respectively. CO2aqis used asCwin equation (5).
Sedimentary OC contentA volumetric sampler (747 cm3) was used to collect sediment from a stratigraphic section (69° 51′ 5.84″ N 154° 51′ 48.26″ W) of aeolian sand and silt that is representative of the permafrost and talik deposits underlying the lakes in these respective surficial geology units of the North Slope. This frozen sediment was cleared on a near vertical face and allowed to thaw just before sampling. To analyse % OC, we first removed soil carbonates by soaking 1 cm3of dry sediment in a 10% HCl mixture overnight. We assumed that this removed all carbonate because: (1) a visual inspection of the untreated sediments determined the majority of inorganic C to be calcite (removed by 10% HCl at room temperature) and (2) % OC in HCl-treated samples was strongly positively correlated with the root biomass in the same samples (which means non-pedogenic carbonate was not a factor). Samples were then centrifuged, decanted and rinsed with deionized water until to reach a pH of 5.5. Acidified sediment samples were then analysed for C content on a C:N analyser (TruSpec (LECO) by analysing the products of sample combustion at 950 °C for CO2and using an infrared CO2detector at the Forest Soils Laboratory at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. We estimated the analytical precision as the s.d. of values based on two replicates of the National Institute of Standards and Technology Buffalo River Sediment standards per 40 samples. The total s.d. for all the standards was <0.02% OC.
Regional CH4and CO2lake–atmosphere diffusive fluxThe fluxes (F) of dissolved CH4and CO2were calculated using a Fickian diffusion model:WhereCwis the concentration of either CH4or CO2in the water,Cais the concentration of CH4or CO2in the surface water that is in equilibrium with the atmosphere andkis the water-to-air gas-exchange velocity. In an effort to constrain the temporal variability, we collected three water samples for dissolved CH4and CO2concentrations over the course of approximately 2 h in the same location near the centre of each lake. In our flux calculation,Cwrepresents the mean of the three samples. Atmospheric background values of 1.91 ppm for CH4and 400 ppm for CO2were taken from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Barrow, AK observatory Global Monitoring Division database, and used to calculateCa. To determinek, we used the model of Cole and Caraco53, which empirically determined the relationship ofk600(cm hr−1) and wind speed at 10 m (U10(m s−1)) to be:Oncek600is known, it is converted tokvia:WhereScis the temperature-adjusted Schmidt number of either CH4or CO2.
We assumed that all the diffusive fluxes of CH4and CO2occurred between ice breakup in the spring and freeze-up in the fall. In August of 2014, a subset of seven lakes within the glaciomarine, coastal plain, aeolian sand and aeolian silt geology categories were sampled for dissolved CH4and CO2at the surface. Daily fluxes were estimated for each lake for every ice-free day in 2014. For each lake, the ice-free period was determined as the cumulative number of days starting from the day before rapid warming was observed (indicative of ice break-up) and ending on the last day where daily average water temperature was above freezing (on average 122 d for the whole study region). This was determined from hourly water-temperature observations obtained by CALON (NSF Award no. 1107607) buoy monitoring stations. The temperature data were downloaded from the NSF Arctic Data Center (https://arcticdata.io/catalog/#data/page/0). Daily average water temperatures and wind speeds were also used to calculate the average solubility and gas-exchange velocities (k), respectively, for CH4and CO2during each day of the ice-free period. Historical daily average wind data for the ice-free period was downloaded for stations at Barrow, AK and Atqasuk, AK from the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information web service (http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/). Wind data from either Barrow or Atqasuk were used based on each lake’s proximity to either weather station.
The August concentrations of CH4and CO2, along with the lake pH measured at the time of sample collection, were applied to all ice-free days during the summer of 2014. This assumption is probably a source of error in our flux estimate. During the August survey, one lake (BRW 100) was replicated in time (measurements one week apart) and two others (BRW 130 and RDC 310) were replicated spatially (approximately 1 km apart on the lake). In both scenarios, the mean of the replicate concentration measurements was prescribed in the whole-summer flux calculations.
Winter (April 2014) dissolved-gas concentrations were calculated during the headspace equilibration technique (described above), in which the entire equilibrated headspace was collected and CH4and CO2were purified. Yields of CH4and CO2were measured manometrically using a calibrated baratron, and then used to determine the concentration of each gas in the original headspace. Headspace concentrations were then used with Henry’s Law to determine the dissolved-gas concentration in each sample. As below-ice concentrations of dissolved CH4and CO2were typically much higher than during the ice-free August survey, it is likely that excess gas was emitted during ice breakup in the spring. Ice growth probably reaches a maximum depth in April.
Water-volume reduction from ice growth could explain 10–100% of the increased below-ice concentrations of dissolved CH4and CO2when compared with the concentrations in August. This effect was considered when estimating the rapid equilibration of dissolved gas with the atmosphere during the ice breakup in the spring (ice-out flux) from each lake. To estimate ice-out fluxes, we applied a concentration effect (based on the maximum ice thickness and lake volume) to August CH4and CO2concentration measurements. We then subtracted this concentration from the actual measured concentration below the ice in April. The difference was considered to be the CH4or CO2accumulation from sediment production and emission into the water during the ice-cover season. The accumulated mass was then divided by the number of days of ice cover in between when the ice first appeared on each lake in the autumn and the day that the below-ice concentrations were measured. This value (grams per day) is an estimate of the integrated average accumulation rate below the ice. Next, this rate was multiplied by the total number of ice-cover days to estimate the total accumulation of CH4and CO2below the ice in each lake. As this accumulation is conceived to be the excess dissolved CH4and CO2above the assumed open-water steady-state concentration measured in August, we interpret it as the total diffusive ice-out flux.
Including the estimate of ice-out fluxes, our regional average daily ice-free diffusive CH4flux was 6.2 ± 3.4 mg CH4m−2d−1. This estimate is within the range of pan-Arctic diffusive emissions from tundra-thaw lakes (mean 15.6 mg CH4m−2d−1, range 0.5–90.1 mg CH4m−2d−1,n= 23) (ref.
2). Our ice-out CH4fluxes ranged from 0 to 14% (n= 7) of total ice-free CH4diffusive flux, which is less than previous estimates from North Slope lakes54. The average daily ice-free diffusive CH4flux (excluding ice-out flux) was 5.9 ± 0.1 mg CH4m−2d−1, and closely resembles the average of 6.9 mg CH4m−2d−1of an open-water diffusion-only flux previously observed using similar methods for North Slope lakes27. Our mean daily diffusive CO2flux estimate of 2,620 ± 2,240 mg CO2m−2d−1is on the high end of the range of CO2fluxes reported by a previous study of 25 North Slope lakes55.
Our data represent a minimum estimate for the total annual CH4fluxes from Alaskan Arctic thaw lakes because we did not include ice-free ebullition or ice-bubble-storage emissions36,56,57. However, by measuring the diffusive CH4flux in the centre of the lakes, where the water/atmosphere gas exchange velocity is probably higher than on the lake margins, the whole-lake diffusive flux of CH4and CO2may be slightly overestimated58.
Daily fluxes of CH4and CO2were calculated for each lake’s ice-free period. The values were totalled and added to each lake’s respective ice-out flux. This total value was treated as the annual diffusive flux for each lake.
All the lakes were sources of C to the atmosphere (regional total, 0.89 ± 0.2 Tg C yr−1(C = C-CO2+ C-CH4)). At the time of the flux measurement, one thaw lake, underlain by glaciomarine geology, was a sink for atmospheric CO2(−42.6 ± 0.7 mg C-CO2m−2d−1). However, high CH4emissions combined with the estimated ice-out flux of CO2from this lake were enough to outweigh the observed C sink, even when the sink was extrapolated to the whole ice-free season (117 d). Overall, this lake was an annual CO2and CH4source to the atmosphere of 1.39 ± 0.04 Mg C-CO2+ C-CH4. We assumed this behaviour was consistent with that of other thaw lakes in the glaciomarine category and applied fluxes accordingly when upscaling to the whole region.
A lake survey in 201459estimated that approximately 85,000 lakes of area >0.5 ha exist north of 68° N in Alaska. Using an ArcGIS shapefile (10,660 km2) generated from this report and geospatial analysis, we determined the total lake surface area within each geology category where14C measurements were made. The total study area, including the land and lake area (231,157 km2), was determined by summating the areas of all general geology units contained within the lake survey59. Annual areal fluxes were averaged for each geological unit surveyed during August 2014 (seven lakes within four geologic units). For the geological units not sampled in August (fluvial young, fluvial old and glacial young (14% of the total lake area in study)), annual diffusive fluxes were prescribed from observed units that had similar below-ice concentrations in April. For lakes within the observed geological units (81% of the total), the annual diffusive C-CH4and C-CO2fluxes were estimated by multiplying the average areal fluxes in each geological unit by its respective total lake area. For lakes outside the observed geological units (19% of the total), the mean of the areal fluxes from the observed units was multiplied by the total lake area in the unobserved geology. To estimate the total annual diffusive flux from the entire study region, fluxes from the observed and unobserved lakes were added and are shown in Table1.
The total diffusive flux of CH4and CO2sourced from ancient C (fixed from the atmosphere ≥11,500 YBP) was calculated by multiplying the mean fraction of the ancient C emissions (average of the possible contributions from 11.5 kYBP plus14C-free end members in the isotopic mass-balance model) for each geological unit by its respective total C flux. This gave the total ancient C flux (g) as both dissolved CH4and dissolved CO2for all the lakes in each geological unit. Similar to the total flux (described above), an estimate of the ancient C flux from lakes in the unobserved geological units was determined by multiplying the mean of the fraction of the ancient C from observed units by the estimated total C-CH4and C-CO2fluxes from the lakes in unobserved geology. This value was added to the total ancient flux from the lakes in observed units, and then divided by the total C flux (modern + ancient (for CH4and CO2)) and is presented as the flux-weighted fraction of total CH4and CO2emissions sourced from ancient C (Table1).
Five-source isotopic mass-balance modelIsoSource37, an open-source Visual Basic software, was used to compute the range of possible contributions from five prescribed sources (fA,fB,fC,fDandfE) to the mean FM value of dissolved CH4and CO2in each geology class:where FMSis the predicted solution to the mass-balance equation andfAis the proportional source contribution from decaying C sequestered during the post-bomb period (1950–2012). For FMA, we used the integrated annual average of atmospheric14CO2from 1950–2012 from the Hua et al.
60atmospheric record and extended it with the Barrow NOAA observatory record from X. Xu (personal communication) to give FMA= 1.2211. Similarly,fBis the proportional source contribution from decaying organic material of recent photosynthesis (calendar year 2013 atmospheric CO2FMBvalue = 1.0313) (also from the Barrow NOAA observatory (X. Xu, personal communication),fCrepresents the contribution from decaying 5,000 YBP organic C (FMC= 0.5366),fDrepresents decaying 11,500 YBP C (FMD= 0.2389) andfErepresents14C-free 'also known as dead' C sources (FME= 0). As there are more than two unknowns in equation (8), which allows no unique solution, this model uses the principle of mass balance to compute iteratively multiple combinations of feasible source contributions in 5% increments (fA,fB,fC,fDandfE). A combination of source proportions is considered feasible when the predicted solution (FMS) falls within the 'tolerance value' range of the observed mean FM for each geological unit. The 'tolerance value' is equal to the standard error of the observed mean FM value for each geology class. Proportional contributions that fall outside the 10th and 90th percentile range of all computed solutions for a given source were considered unlikely and treated as outliers.
Geospatial extrapolation of CH4agesIn the simplest form of inverse distance weighting (Fig.
3), predictions are made at an unobserved location using a weighted sum of the observations, in which the weights are inversely proportional to the distance between the unobserved and observed locations. As the14CH4age observed at a given location is correlated with its geological substrate type, we also include a parameter that reduces the weights of observations with geology types different from that of the predicted location.
Taken together, we estimate the14CH4age,Z, at an unobserved location,x, with geology type,g, as a weighted sum of theK14CH4age observations,Zk, at locations,xk, with geology type,gk, as:with weights,wk:andWe use a typical value ofβ= 2, to reduce sharp gradients in the interpolated product. The choice ofGwas somewhat arbitrary and was selected based on visual inspection of the final product. Predictions were made on a regular 1 × 1 km grid over the study area bounded by 68.24°N – 71.66°N and 159.13°W – 147.77°W. We only retain predicted ages at a location if at least one observation has the same geology substrate type.
Although we cannot formally quantify the interpolation error for points without direct measurements, we can provide an estimate of the interpolation’s prediction quality in terms of the pairwise distances from measured and predicted points. We define a quality of prediction (QP) at each predicted point as the effective number of measurements at a distance of 50 km that went into its interpolation (equation (12) and Supplementary Fig.
2, Equation12).
wherewk* is calculated in the same aswkin equation (10), but by forcing distances |x–xk| to take a minimum of 25 km. If this minimum distance was not applied, theQPof the predicted points that are in very close proximity to the measured points is much less meaningful.
Averaging and statisticsWhere applicable (age of CH4versus CO2, ANOVA geology versus age for CH4and CO2, geospatial interpolation of CH4, end-member determination for isotopic mass balance for CH4and CO2, and summer 2014 spatial and temporal replicates), replicate samples (spatial or temporal) were averaged before the statistical tests were conducted. Supplementary Table4gives a detailed summary of the statistical results and analysis.
Data availabilitySupplementary Information gives the relevant data that support the findings of this study but omits the atmospheric radiocarbon data (X. Xu, personal communication) used to extend the record published by Hua et al. (2013).
