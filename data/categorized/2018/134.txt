IBM Research-ChinaIBM Research Develops AI to Greatly Improve Tea InspectionWhen you drink that cup of tea, you sure don’t want any fluff floating there. That’s the most critical step in tea production – removing impurities, be it stems, seeds, stones or even bugs. If they do make it into your drink, the brand may get fined; at the very least, you probably won’t buy […]Continue readingShare this post:IBM Research-ChinaBuild Machine Learning models with Minimal Effort with AutoMLThe research and development of machine learning (ML) across various domains, such as computer vision, natural language processing, and speech transcription has been growing rapidly. ML is important in many enterprise applications across industries such as manufacturing, finance, healthcare, and marketing. With the growing adoption of ML, it is increasingly challenging to design or choose […]Continue readingShare this post:IBM Research-ChinaNeuNetS: Automating Neural Network Model Synthesis for Broader Adoption of AINeuNetS uses AI to automatically synthesize deep neural networks faster and more easily than ever before, scaling up the deployment and adoption of AI.

The 40 young students, selected from a pool of nearly 200 applicants, spent the day interacting with and exploring some of IBM Research’s advanced AI technologies. We’ve been advancing cutting-edge technologies at our China lab for more than two decades. This event, […]Continue readingShare this post:IBM Research-ChinaIBM Research and Tencent Delight Basketball Fans with AI-Based Highlight ReelAt 11:45 p.m. on June 8 in the Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland, Ohio, the Golden State Warriors finished a sweep of the Cleveland Cavaliers with a 108-85 blowout win. As one of the most dominant players in the NBA, the Warriors’ Kevin Durant was named the 2018 NBA Finals MVP, his second time earning […]Continue readingShare this post:IBM Research-ChinaUsing Deep Learning to Predict Emergency Room VisitsAt IBM Research, we are using deep learning to explore new solutions for a range of health care challenges. One such challenge is emergency room (ER) overcrowding, which can lead to long wait times for treatment. Overcrowding results in part from people visiting the ER for non-emergency conditions rather than relying on primary physicians. Patients […]Continue readingShare this post:IBM Research-ChinaThe Road Not Taken: Computer-generated poetryRoses are red, the grass is green. Here’s how poems can be written by a creative machine. Every year, millions of Chinese families gather to watch a special celebration known as the Spring Festival Gala. It is the most watched television show in the world. This year’s gala included a special online sideshow, during which China’s Central […]Continue readingShare this post:IBM Research-ChinaImproving Healthcare in China with Cognitive AnalyticsWith the world’s largest population, China generates an unprecedented amount of medical data. It’s an ideal harvest ground for the development and application of cognitive solutions that extract insights from data to improve medical management. The landscape of Chinese healthcare has undergone huge transformation over the past 20 years. The digitization of medical records resulted […]Continue readingShare this post:IBM ResearchThe world is our labLearn moreConnect with us
