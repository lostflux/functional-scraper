PhilologyPhilologyis the study oflanguagein oral andwrittenhistorical sources; it is the intersection oftextual criticism,literary criticism,history, andlinguistics(with especially strong ties toetymology).
[1][2][3]Philology is more commonly defined as the study of literary texts as well as oral and written records, the establishment of their authenticity and their original form, and the determination of their meaning. A person who pursues this kind of study is known as a philologist.
In older usage, especially British, philology is more general, coveringcomparativeandhistorical linguistics.
[4][5]Classical philologystudiesclassical languages. Classical philology principally originated from theLibrary of Pergamumand theLibrary of Alexandria[6]around the fourth century BCE, continued by Greeks and Romans throughout theRoman/Byzantine Empire. It was eventually resumed by European scholars of theRenaissance, where it was soon joined by philologies of other European (Germanic,Celtic), Eurasian (Slavistics, etc.), Asian (Arabic,Persian,Sanskrit,Chinese, etc.), and African (Egyptian,Nubian, etc.) languages.
Indo-European studiesinvolve the comparative philology of allIndo-European languages.
Philology, with its focus on historical development (diachronicanalysis), is contrasted withlinguisticsdue toFerdinand de Saussure's insistence on the importance ofsynchronic analysis. The contrast continued with the emergence ofstructuralismandChomskyanlinguistics alongside its emphasis onsyntax, although research in historical linguistics is often characterized by reliance on philological materials and findings.
ContentsEtymology[edit]The termphilologyis derived from theGreekφιλολογία(philología),[7]from the termsφίλος(phílos) "love, affection, loved, beloved, dear, friend" andλόγος(lógos) "word, articulation, reason", describing a love of learning, of literature, as well as of argument and reasoning, reflecting the range of activities included under the notion ofλόγος. The term changed little with the Latinphilologia, and later entered the English language in the 16th century, from theMiddle Frenchphilologie, in the sense of 'love of literature'.
Theadjectiveφιλόλογος(philólogos) meant 'fond of discussion or argument, talkative', inHellenistic Greek, also implying an excessive ("sophistic") preference of argument over the love of true wisdom,φιλόσοφος(philósophos).
As anallegoryof literary erudition,philologiaappears in fifth-century postclassical literature (Martianus Capella,De nuptiis Philologiae et Mercurii), an idea revived in Late Medieval literature (Chaucer,Lydgate).
The meaning of "love of learning and literature" was narrowed to "the study of the historical development of languages" (historical linguistics) in 19th-century usage of the term. Due to the rapid progress made in understandingsound lawsandlanguage change, the "golden age of philology" lasted throughout the 19th century, or "fromGiacomo LeopardiandFriedrich SchlegeltoNietzsche".
[8]Branches[edit]Comparative[edit]Thecomparative linguisticsbranch of philology studies the relationship between languages. Similarities betweenSanskritandEuropean languageswere first noted in the early 16th century[9]and led to speculation of a common ancestor language from which all these descended. It is now namedProto-Indo-European. Philology's interest in ancient languages led to the study of what were, in the 18th century, "exotic" languages, for the light they could cast on problems in understanding anddecipheringthe origins of older texts.
Textual[edit]Philology also includes the study of texts and their history. It includes elements oftextual criticism, trying to reconstruct an author's original text based on variant copies of manuscripts. This branch of research arose among ancient scholars in the Greek-speaking world of the 4th century BC, who desired to establish a standard text of popular authors for the purposes of both sound interpretation and secure transmission. Since that time, the original principles of textual criticism have been improved and applied to other widely distributed texts such as the Bible. Scholars have tried to reconstruct the original readings of theBiblefrom the manuscript variants. This method was applied to Classical Studies and to medieval texts as a way to reconstruct the author's original work. The method produced so-called "critical editions", which provided a reconstructed text accompanied by a "critical apparatus", i.e., footnotes that listed the various manuscript variants available, enabling scholars to gain insight into the entire manuscript tradition and argue about the variants.
[10]A related study method known ashigher criticismstudies the authorship, date, and provenance of text to place such text in historical context.
[10]As these philological issues are often inseparable from issues of interpretation, there is no clear-cut boundary between philology andhermeneutics.
[10]When text has a significant political or religious influence (such as the reconstruction of Biblical texts), scholars have difficulty reaching objective conclusions.
Some scholars avoid all critical methods of textual philology,[10]especially in historical linguistics, where it is important to study the actual recorded materials. The movement known asNew Philologyhas rejected textual criticism because it injects editorial interpretations into the text and destroys the integrity of the individual manuscript, hence damaging the reliability of the data. Supporters of New Philology insist on a strict "diplomatic" approach: a faithful rendering of the text exactly as found in the manuscript, without emendations.
Cognitive[edit]Another branch of philology, cognitive philology, studies written and oral texts. Cognitive philology considers these oral texts as the results of human mental processes. This science compares the results of textual science with the results of experimental research of both psychology and artificial intelligence production systems.
Decipherment[edit]In the case ofBronze Age literature, philology includes the priordeciphermentof the language under study. This has notably been the case with theEgyptian,Sumerian,Assyrian,Hittite,UgariticandLuwianlanguages. Beginning with the famous decipherment and translation of theRosetta StonebyJean-François Champollionin 1822, a number of individuals attempted to decipher the writing systems of theAncient Near EastandAegean. In the case ofOld PersianandMycenaean Greek, decipherment yielded older records of languages already known from slightly more recent traditions (Middle PersianandAlphabetic Greek).
Work on the ancient languages of the Near East progressed rapidly. In the mid-19th century,Henry Rawlinsonand others deciphered theBehistun Inscription, which records the same text inOld Persian,Elamite, andAkkadian, using a variation ofcuneiformfor each language. The elucidation of cuneiform led to the decipherment ofSumerian.
Hittitewas deciphered in 1915 byBedřich Hrozný.
Linear B, a script used in the ancient Aegean, was deciphered in 1952 byMichael VentrisandJohn Chadwick, who demonstrated that it recorded an early form of Greek, now known asMycenaean Greek.
Linear A, the writing system that records the still-unknown language of theMinoans, resists deciphering, despite many attempts.
Work continues on scripts such as theMaya, with great progress since the initial breakthroughs of the phonetic approach championed byYuri Knorozovand others in the 1950s. Since the late 20th century, the Maya code has been almost completely deciphered, and the Mayan languages are among the most documented and studied in Mesoamerica. The code is described as alogosyllabicstyle of writing, which could be used to fully express any spoken thought.
Contention[edit]In the Anglo-Saxon world, the term philology to describe work on languages and literatures, which had become synonymous with the practices of German scholars, was abandoned as a consequence of anti-German feeling followingWorld War I.
[11]Most continental European countries still maintain the term to designate departments, colleges, position titles, and journals.
J. R. R. Tolkienopposed the nationalist reaction against philological practices, claiming that "the philological instinct" was "universal as is the use of language".
[12][13]InBritish Englishusage, and in British academia,philologyremains largely synonymous with "historical linguistics", while inUS English, and US academia, the wider meaning of "study of a language's grammar, history and literary tradition" remains more widespread.
[14][15]Based on the harsh critique of Friedrich Nietzsche, some US scholars since the 1980s have viewed philology as responsible for a narrowlyscientisticstudy of language and literature.
[11]Disagreements in the modern day of this branch of study are followed with the likes of how the method is treated amongst other scholars, as noted by both the philologists R.D Fulk and Leonard Neidorf who have been quoted saying "This field "philology’s commitment to falsification renders it “at odds with what many literary scholars believe, because the purpose of philology is to narrow the range of possible interpretations rather than to treat all reasonable ones as equal”.
[16]This use of falsification can be seen in the debate surrounding the etymology of the Old English characterUnferthfrom the heroic epic poemBeowulf.
James Turner further disagrees with how the use of the term is dismissed in the academic world, stating that due to its branding as a "simpleminded approach to their subject"[17]that the term has become unknown to college-educated students, furthering the stereotypes of "scruitiny of ancient Greek or Roman texts of a nit-picking classicist" and only the "technical research into languages and families".
[18]In popular culture[edit]In theSpace TrilogybyC.S. Lewis, the main character, Elwin Ransom, is a philologist – as was Lewis' close friendJ. R. R. Tolkien.
Dr. Edward Morbius, one of the main characters in the science fiction filmForbidden Planet, is a philologist.
Philip, the main character ofChristopher Hampton's 'bourgeois comedy'The Philanthropist, is a professor of philology in an Englishuniversity town.
Moritz-Maria von Igelfeld, the main character inAlexander McCall Smith's 1997 comic novelPortuguese Irregular Verbsis a philologist, educated at Cambridge.
The main character in theAcademy Award Nominee for Best Foreign Language filmin 2012,Footnote, is aHebrewphilologist, and a significant part of the film deals with his work.
A main character of the science fiction TV showStargate SG-1,Dr. Daniel Jackson, is mentioned as having a PhD in philology.
