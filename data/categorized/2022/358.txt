AboutMachineScienceConstructionAssemblyNews & MediaTop"Final closing piece"ITER Head of Construction Youngeek Jung speaks at a ceremony on 24 March 2022 in the Cryostat Workshop. Speaking of the completed cryostat lid, which has been prepared for storage, he said, "When it next appears, it will be the final closing piece of the largest fusion machine humans have ever dared to build."24 March 2022In person and through video link...
Gathered in the Cryostat Workshop on site or present virtually through a video connection with India, the designers, manufacturers, machining experts, metrology specialists and welders involved in the realization of the ITER cryostat bore testimony to the magnitude and complexity of the international venture.
24 March 2022Thanks to ...
The steel elements were manufactured by Larsen & Toubro (India) for the Indian Domestic Agency. Welding and assembly were carried out in the Cryostat Workshop by MAN Energy Solutions (Germany). The 665-tonne component will be stored outdoors from October 2022 on in order to make room in this workshop for other machine assembly activities.
10 March 2022Lid completedApproximately one year after work started on the ITER cryostat top lid, the team has completed the 665-tonne component. Only some cleaning and final verification checks remain.
10 March 2022The most complex of the sectionsThe top lid is also the most structurally complex of the four sections that make up the ITER cryostat. Curved in three directions like a skull cap, it is strengthened by an array of stiffeners and ribs. Here, from left to right: Dipen Shah, from Indian manufacturer Larsen & Toubro; Guillaume Vitupier, leader of the ITER cryostat group; and Girish Kumar Gupta, ITER cryostat engineer.
10 March 2022Six years of activity come to a closeFinal checks before the component is handed over to the ITER Organization late March. The finalization of the top lid concludes six years of work in the Cryostat Workshop for the assembly and welding of the four large ITER cryostat sections.
08 March 2022Like a fire-breathing dragonThis plasma-jet cutting tool is performing precise machining on the cryostat lid. The ultra hot (30 000 °C) hydrogen-nitrogen-argon plasma slices through steel like butter.
22 September 2021Plasma cutting toolPrecisely aligned, the nozzle of the robot's cutting head delivers a super heated jet of hydrogen-nitrogen-argon plasma.
22 September 202150% of welding finalizedEvery radial joint must be leak tested on both surfaces of the steel plate (top and underside), a process that takes about two days. 50% of cryostat lid welding has now been finalized.
22 September 2021Top lid welding kicks offThe alignment of the twelve 30-degree segments has been confirmed and all preparatory activities completed. The four- to five-month campaign to weld the cryostat top lid begins on 7 June 2021.
07 June 2021First "arc"Two welders from MAN Energy Solutions (subcontractor to India's Larsen & Toubro) work in parallel on opposite sides of the component's "skin" to create the ''first arc'' of the welding campaign.

It should be completed by the end of 2021. © Christian Luenig (www.arbeitsblende.de)23 March 2021Top lid enters stageThe top lid will be formed from: 12 lid segments, one centre cylinder and one centre cover. In this photo, welding is performed by a specialist from MAN Energy Solutions (sub-contractor to the Indian firm Larsen & Toubro). © Christian Luenig (www.arbeitsblende.de)23 March 20217 segments assembledSeven of 12 segments have been assembled on the work platform—enough for us to appreciate the size and shape of the cryostat top lid.
02 March 202112 plus 2Specialists from MAN Energy Solutions (contractor to Larsen & Toubro, cryostat manufacturer) are finalizing the installation of the support frame, prior to starting on assembly and welding. The top lid is composed of 12 triangular segments, plus a central disk and a central lid.
09 February 2021Top lid segments unveiledPerfectly aligned on the workshop floor, the major elements of the cryostat top lid will soon be positioned inside the supporting frame in the background of this photograph (the central cylinder is hidden by the frame).
09 February 2021Top lid: start of assemblyAll of the segents of the cryostat top lid have reached ITER and the Indian Domestic Agency teams in the Cryostat Workshop can begin assembly and welding.
02 February 2021Segments arrivingInside of the Cryostat Workshop, the latest top lid elements to arrive are unpacked.
14 January 2021Final lid segments arrivingThe last segments of the 665-tonne cryostat lid (including the central disk) have arrived in France.

07 October 2020The work to comeThe top lid will be assembled from 12 triangular segments and a central disk.
24 September 2020New segments arriveThe first five segments of the cryostat top lid arrived from India this week.
24 September 2020Lift offThe 375-tonne component is lifted by overhead crane and delivered to the Tokamak pit on the opposite side of the building.
31 August 2020Successful transferOn 22 August 2020, the lower cylinder travelled the short distance from the Cryostat Workshop to the Assembly Hall.
22 August 2020Second cryostat section ready for insertionThe lower cylinder, which had been cocooned on the platform, is now ready for transfer into the Assembly Hall. After some light preparatory activities, it will be ready for assembly into the machine pit.
22 August 2020Top lid elements, ready to shipIn India, Larsen & Toubro has finalized all of the elements of the top lid (12 triangular segments plus a central disk). The segments will soon ship to ITER for assembly in the Cryostat Workshop.
30 June 2020650-tonne lid, temporarily assembledThe segments of the top lid were put together at Larsen & Toubro's Hazira factory for verification, and then disassembled and packed for shipment. This brings cryostat manufacturing to an end for the Indian firm, which signed a contract back in 2012.
30 June 2020Base installedPart one of the cryostat, the 1,250 base, was inserted into the machine assembly pit on 26 May 2020. The operation went as smoothly as planned.
28 May 2020Preparing the base for liftingStanding inside the "dish" of the cryostat base, these employees are involved in the preparations for the "big lift," when the overhead cranes raise this 1,250-load high overhead and then travel to the Tokamak pit. As a preparatory activity, the base will be raised a few centimetres in the week to come.
06 May 2020Not empty for longAfter the cryostat base and upper cylinder were removed from the Cryostat Workshop in mid-April, the building was empty for one week. Now, one of the machine's 18 toroidal field coils—#12, supplied by the Japanese Domestic Agency—has been moved in so that construction teams can unwrap the component and prepare it for handling and pre-assembly activities.
24 April 2020Safe in the Assembly HallThe 192 wheels of the self-propelled modular transporter carried the 1,250-base carefully and successfully into the Assembly Hall. After unwrapping and preparatory works, the overhead cranes will enter into action. They were sized for this load—ITER's heaviest.
17 April 2020Moved next doorOn Friday 17 April, the heaviest piece of the ITER machine—the cryostat base—is transferred into the ITER Assembly Hall. There, it will be prepared for the May 2020 transfer to the Tokamak Pit, where 18 ball-and-socket joints ("bearings") are waiting to receive its weight.
17 April 2020Leaving homeThe cryostat base was assembled and welded in the Cryostat Workshop between September 2016 and early 2019. After site acceptance tests, responsibility for the component was transferred to the ITER Organization for pre-installation works such as the welding of cooling water bellows and skirt supports. Today is the first time the cryostat base will be leaving "home."17 April 2020Third completed cryostat sectionThe cryostat upper cylinder, assembled in the Cryostat Workshop from 12 segments manufactured in India. It took less than one year to complete.
15 April 2020SistersNot far from the Cryostat Workshop, two cryostat sections are now stored—the lower cylinder (right, 375 tonnes) and the upper cylinder (left, 430 tonnes).
15 April 2020Ready for the weatherFurther layers of plastic material will be added once the component is settled into the storage area. The synthetic skin that is formed seals the upper cylinder hermetically and protects it from weather, moisture and dust.
15 April 2020On many wheels and axlesThe 430-tonne upper cylinder is cocooned and ready for storage outdoors. The component is transported out of the workshop by self-propelled modular transporter (SPMT).
15 April 2020Second section leaves workshopThe double doors of the Cryostat Workshop are open and teams are getting ready to remove the upper cylinder to storage. Its removal will allow the cryostat base to be moved out at the end of this week.
15 April 2020Upper cylinder assembly accomplishedWork on the upper cylinder is complete. The 430-tonne component will soon be cocooned and moved to storage outside the building.
21 February 2020Cleaning operationBefore cocooning the component, more than 2,500 square metres of stainless steel must be cleaned using cloth, demineralized water, a standard solvent and ... a lot of elbow grease.
21 February 2020Destination for the baseThe last activities are underway at the bottom of the Tokamak pit to prepare for the arrival of the 1,250-tonne cryostat base. In the picture, we can distinguish three bearings (ball-and-socket joints) covered in plastic, and the different interface points along the wall.
13 February 2020Cryostat base: grand opening soonThe huge cryostat base section will descend from above, supported by the overhead cranes as it is lowered 30 metres to the bottom of the pit.
13 February 2020Last manufacturing tasks in IndiaAt the Larsen & Toubro factory in Hazira, India, the elements of the top lid of the cryostat lid are in fabrication. These "pieces" make up the last of four main cryostat sectors (base, lower cylinder, upper cylinder, top lid). They will be shipped to ITER for assembly in the Cryostat Workshop.
25 November 2019Upper cylinder advancesThe assembly of the 430-tonne upper cylinder is underway in India's on-site Cryostat Workshop. Contractors Larsen & Toubro (fabrication and assembly) and MAN Energy Solutions (welding) are in charge of carrying out the assembly activities.

23 July 2019The hands-on team from Larsen & ToubroOver its 80 years of existence, Larsen & Toubro Ltd. has built solar and nuclear plants, ports and airports, supertankers and submarines and played a key role is putting into Mars orbit the Mangalyaan space probe. Still, there are challenges in the fabrication of the ITER cryostat that the company had never faced. This young team is at the centre of the cryostat project, including Project Manager Patel Chiarg (third from left).
23 July 201960% completeOn 23 July 2019, ITER Director-General Bernard Bigot, India's Ambassador to France Vinay Mohan Kwatra, and the former chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission of India, Anil Kakodkar, symbolically smash a bottle of French champagne on a large chunk of steel representing the ITER cryostat. Sixty percent of manufacturing has been completed, and the base and lower cylinder have been accepted by the ITER Organization.
23 July 2019Gathered for a special celebrationA small ceremony in the Cryostat Workshop is held for representatives of all involved parties: the ITER Organization, ITER India, Larsen & Toubro, and MAN Energy Solutions. In the background, work has begun on the upper cylinder.
23 July 2019Inside of the completed baseThis group is standing inside of the 1,250-tonne base, which will be the first major component installed in the Tokamak Pit next year.
23 July 2019Wraps offWork on the cryostat base has ended. The 1,250-tonne component, which resembles a soup dish, or an upside down hat, will remain in the Cryostat Workshop until required in the ITER machine assembly sequence.
04 July 2019Fore, mid and aftIn the foreground, metrologists are completing a survey of the "skirt" of the base; in the middle of the Workshop, segments of the upper cylinder, freshly arrived from India; and in the background, the assembly platform for the upper cylinder.
04 July 2019Final verificationsA specialist from Indian Domestic Agency contractor MAN Energy Solutions is performing a final dimensional inspection on the "holes" that will receive the bolts of the toroidal field coil and vacuum vessel gravity supports. Match up must be close to perfect.
04 July 2019Interfacing with the crownThis is where the cryostat base will interface with the concrete support crown of the Tokamak Pit and the bioshield inner walls. The protruding steel piece at the centre-right of the image is one of 18 "toroidal lugs" that will lock into the bioshield.
04 July 2019Capitalizing on lessons learnedThe assembly and welding of the upper cylinder will follow more or less the pattern of work of the lower cylinder. Lessons learned are already bearing fruit: it took less than two weeks to install the first three segments (out of six) of upper cylinder tier one onto the frame.
04 July 2019Work starts on upper cylinderSeveral of the upper cylinder's first-tier segments have already been unwrapped and installed on the assembly platform.
04 July 2019Work to start to assemble the upper cylinderThe assembly platform is in place for the upper cylinder and the first segments have arrived.
02 July 2019Twin underway on the insideNearly as wide as the building itself this "piece" of ITER—the cryostat lower cylinder—was moved outside of the Cryostat Workshop so that its near twin—the upper cylinder—can be aligned and welded. Photo: ITER Organization/EJF Riche19 June 2019Upside-down hatThe base of the cryostat is shaped like an upside-down hat. The pedestal ring will be supported by the concrete crown at the bottom of the Tokamak Pit and, in turn, the ring will support the rest of the machine.

It has been safely "cocooned" and stored outside of the Cryostat Workshop to wait for its turn in the machine assembly sequence.
13 June 2019Welcome: upper cylinder segmentsThe first upper cylinder segments (tier one) have arrived in the on-site workshop. They were fabricated by Larsen & Toubro in Hazira, India, and shipped by the Indian Domestic Agency.
24 May 2019Unwrapping the new arrivalsThrough the open doors of the workshop, we see the first unwrapped segment of the upper cylinder (tier one). In the background is the cryostat base.
23 May 2019How to make a giant thermosThe Cryostat Workshop was part of the site tour offered to participants of the 14th edition of the ITER Open Doors Day event. Saroj Kumar Jha, ITER Project Associate from India, provides explanations to the first group of visitors.
18 May 2019Upper cylinder: settling into its new homeContractors continue to apply plastic to the cocoon of the lower cylinder. Already, though, it is well protected from the weather.
18 May 2019Finalizing the cryostat baseFinal machining works are underway on the cryostat base. Pictured are the interface holes that have been machined in the base for one toroidal field gravity support.
30 April 2019Just a short distance to travelThe 375-tonne component left the building on its assembly platform, propelled by four multi-axle SPMTs (self propelled modular transporters). Everything went smoothly.
15 April 2019Lower cylinder transferOn 15 April, the lower cylinder is moved out of the Cryostat Workshop to exterior storage area 73 (out of the picture frame, further to the left), where it will remain until it is time to enter the Cleaning Facility (right) for integration into the ITER machine pit.
15 April 2019Careful nowShims are adjusted under every "foot" before the assembly platform is lowered to the ground and the SPMTs are removed. With the successful transfer of the lower cylinder out of the Cryostat Workshop space has been created for the assembly of a new frame to receive the elements of the cryostat upper cylinder, which ship this month from India and are expected in May on site.
15 April 2019Like clockworkParticipating in the transfer operation were members of the ITER Organization construction teams, ITER logistics provider DAHER, transportation specialist Sarens, ITER India and its contractor Larsen & Toubro, the European Domestic Agency and its contractor ENGAGE, and MOMENTUM—the ITER Construction Management-as-Agent contractor.
15 April 2019Coordination for successAnil Kumar Bhardwaj, Cryostat Group Leader, and Patrick Petit, In-Cryostat Assembly Section Leader, watch over the transfer operation. The 12-metre tall, nearly 30-metre-wide component is one of the largest "pieces" of the ITER machine. It will be stored on the construction platform until required in the assembly sequence.
15 April 2019192 wheelsA few days before the transfer, transporters were delivered and assembled. Their configuration under the 375-tonne component has been carefully planned.
12 April 2019"Mothballing"Layers of synthetic thermoplastic material are "melted" together through the application of sprayable glue. The technique, called "mothballing," is designed and implemented by Cocoon Holland, a specialist in weatherproof storage solutions.
05 April 2019Controlled environmentInside of the cocoon, the enclosed air will be kept constantly circulating and humidity will be maintained at a steady 38 percent—conditions that prevent the formation of corrosion or mould.
02 April 2019A cocoon for the cryostatAn all-weather protection system is being installed around the lower cylinder, which will move out to storage on the platform in April.
02 April 2019Work continues on cryostat baseThe three parts of the base—lower sandwich structure, vertical shells, and top pedestal ring—are aligned and the last welding activities are underway. The base section should be finalized in July but, contrary to the lower cylinder, the 1,250-tonne base will remain inside the building to be equipped, under the ITER Organization's responsibility, with different ancillary elements (stoppers for the gravity supports, shims, bellows, etc.).
14 March 2019Only a veilScaffolding around the 10-metre-tall, 30-metre-in-diameter lower cylinder has been removed and only a veil remains. Look closely at the size of the group in the centre.
14 March 2019Windows to the machineThe openings in the cryostat correspond to openings in the vacuum vessel. They will permit auxiliary systems (heating, fuelling, cryogenics, diagnostics, vacuum ...) to reach the machine.
14 March 2019Standing tallRepresentatives of the ITER Organization, which designed the cryostat and will integrate it into the machine; of the Indian Domestic Agency responsible for its procurement; of Larsen & Toubro which forged the segments; of the German company MAN Energy Solutions which performed assembly and welding gathered on 14 March to mark the completion of the lower cylinder.
14 March 2019Laser mappingThe 375-tonne lower cylinder will soon be enveloped in a protective cocoon that will insulate it from dust and humidity. In the meantime, metrology specialists are using 3D laser-scanning techniques to map selected areas where the component will interface with other systems (here, a port for the neutral beam injection system). Based on the precise topography of the "as built" component, the interfaces can be reverse-engineered to fit as precisely as possible.
14 March 2019Lower cylinder: surveyed from every angleMetrologists perform the first "as-built" survey of a finalized ITER component.
02 March 2019Lower cylinder: DONEThe final tests have been carried out and the 375-tonne can officially be called "completed." Scaffolding will be removed in March.
27 February 2019Well doneOn 27 February, guests from the Indian Domestic Agency (responsible for procuring the cryostat) and from Indian contractor Larsen & Toubro (L&T) joined the ITER Director-General, ITER Organization staff, and on-site welding specialists from MAN Energy Solutions (subcontractor to L&T) to celebrate the completion of the component.
27 February 2019As we enter 2019 ...
The first welding activities on the cryostat base kicked off in 2016. Today the lower tier has been finalized, the pedestal ring is suspended above and, in between, teams are trial fitting the vertical wall segments.
10 December 2018Base: final assembly stagesThe components of the cryostat base—the 20-metre-in-diameter bottom disk, side shells, and 30-metre-in-diameter pedestal ring—are positioned for final assembly in the Cryostat Workshop. After welding, tests and final machining, site acceptance tests will be carried out in April 2019.
10 December 2018Moving out next yearUpon its completion the lower cylinder will be moved out of the Cryostat Workshop to protected storage on site. That will free the assembly platform for the next activity—the assembly of the upper cylinder from steel segments shipped by India.
10 December 2018Back to the baseBack in August, the vertical shells had already been trial fitted on the bottom sandwich structure, inspected, and then disassembled for adjustment. One by one, the six segments are being re-positioned for final assembly.
10 December 2018A generous volumeThe ITER Tokamak and superconducting magents will all be contained within the generous volume of the cryostat. The lower cylinder is a ten-metre-tall component that will sit on the cryostat base. The upper cylinder will in turn fit perfectly on the lower cylinder and the entire assembly will be topped off with a lid.
10 December 2018Lower cylinder : ready in MarchThe lower cylinder of the cryostat is well advanced. The last seam welds should be completed in one month, and site acceptance tests are scheduled for March.
10 December 2018Welding: the name of the gameIn total, the Indian Domestic Agency estimates that one kilometre of full penetration weld joints will have to be carried out to exacting standards on the four sections of the cryostat in the site workshop, followed by several hundred metres of weld joints to assemble the cryostat sections in the Tokamak Pit. The cryostat chamber must be completely leak free in order to achieve high vacuum within its large volume (8,500 m³).
10 December 2018A peek into the Cryostat WorkshopThe lower cylinder of the cryostat is seen through the open doors of the workshop.
13 November 2018Destined for the cryostatDoric or ionic? Neither. What looks like broken columns from a Greek temple are in fact steel ingots, cooling on a bed of black sand inside the Larsen & Toubro foundry in Hazira, India. Weighing 6 to 200 metric tonnes, they are the raw material for the fabrication of cryostat segments.
24 October 2018Visiting Larsen & ToubroOn 23 October Director-General Bernard Bigot visits Larsen & Toubro's Hazira facility, where the segments of the ITER cryostat are produced.
23 October 2018A prototype sector for the lidThe 655-tonne top lid will be the last of four cryostat sectors to leave the Larsen & Toubro factory (in segments). Before series manufacturing began, a prototype segment was manufactured in order to check potential profile distortions. All 12 top lid segments will be ready for dispatch in the summer of 2019.
23 October 2018Inside Medium Fabrication Shop #4On their way back from lunch, workers at Larsen & Toubro's Hazira faility pass by ongoing works for the ITER cryostat inside Medium Fabrication Shop #4.
23 October 2018Welds. welds and more weldsDespite Larsen & Toubro's extensive experience in manufacturing for the nuclear and space industries, new processes and techniques had to be specifically developed for the welding of the cryostat segments. Pictured here: the welding of two segments for the top lid.
23 October 2018Last verificationFinal dimensional inspection is being conducted on an upper cylinder sector for the ITER cryostat. Seven segments are packed and ready for dispatch; another two are undergoing finishing works and inspections.
23 October 2018Drawing to a closeA formidable industrial venture that began in 2015 is nearing its end. At the Larsen & Tourbo Hazira manufacturing complex, work is underway on the two last orders the company is filling for the ITER cryostat: segments of the 430-tonne upper cylinder and 665-tonne top lid.
23 October 2018Packing is doneThese tier-two upper cylinder segments are being packed and conditioned for the long journey to the ITER site. In the on-site Cryostat Workshop, Larsen & Toubro contractors will weld tier-one segments first, then position tier-two segments on top. Upper cylinder segments will begin arriving at ITER in March 2019.
23 October 2018Reinforced zoneThe asphalt in front of the Cryostat Workshop has been reinforced in order to receive the 375-tonne lower cylinder. Once completed this cryostat component will be stored in this exterior area under a protective "cocoon."10 September 2018A runway for the cryostatA section of runway-worthy tarmac has been completed in front of the Cryostat Workshop, with four times the load-bearing capacity of regular pavement. Other areas will receive the same treatment soon—for example, the road in front of the Cleaning Facility over which all components will pass.

Photo: ITER Organization/EJF Riche24 July 2018On the other side of the shopThe 10-metre-tall lower cylinder has been completely assembled and contractors are verifying the welds. This section will be moved out of the facility next year to make room for the assembly of the upper cylinder.
18 July 2018AdjustingFollowing inspection, the wall segments were disassembled and adjustments are being made with a high-performance plasma torch.
18 July 2018Inspection underwayIt took approximately four weeks to verify half of the vacuum welds of the lower cylinder. Different specific ultrasonic examination probes are being used by Larsen & Toubro specialists to cover various angles and depth ranges.
18 July 2018ITER—a challenge for science photographyDuring his most recent visit to ITER, German photographer Christian Luenig covered the ongoing work on the cryostat. He captured the lower cylinder and base section with their enormous dimensions using a technique called tone mapping which combines multiple exposures with particular contrast and colour adjustments. "Like every visit to the ITER construction site, it was a real challenge," says Luenig.

The team is seen here inside the circle of the component breaking a coconut—an Indian tradition to bring good fortune to a new endeavour.
21 February 2018Looking upStanding in the centre of the cryostat lower cylinder, looking up toward the beams of the gantry crane.
21 February 2018New phase for lower cylinderWelding has started on tier two of the lower cylinder. The completed component will measure 10 metres in height and weigh 375 tonnes.
21 February 2018Inside the soup plateThe base section of the ITER cryostat resembles a deep soup plate. For the moment however, only the base (where two workers are standing) and the rim are in place. The vertical "walls" to connect the two will be inserted at a later stage in order to provide more flexibility for adjustments.
07 February 2018The size of the piecesNothing gives a better sense of the size of the ITER machine than the ongoing works in the Cryostat Workshop, where the the lower cylinder and base section of the cryostat are being assembled and welded under the responsibility of Indian contractor Larsen & Toubro.
07 February 2018Make way for the neutral beamMore than 200 penetrations, some as large as four metres in width, pierce the ITER cryostat. The one pictured here is for the neutral beam injection system, one of the heating systems that will bring the plasma to the required fusion temperature.
07 February 2018Alone in the arenaStacked one upon the other, the two tiers of the cryostat's lower cylinder form a spectacular arena. Ten metres high and 30 metres in diameter, it dwarfs the lone Larsen & Toubro worker standing in the middle. Tier two segments are presently being aligned prior to welding operations. Work should be completed on this 375-tonne cryostat section this summer.
30 January 2018Pedestal weldingTwenty-five percent of the pedestal welding is complete. These technicians are watching the progression of the welding robot as it completes a run.
30 January 2018Unpacked in the workshopThe first tier-two segments of the lower cylinder have been unpacked in the Cryostat Workshop. These 5-metre-tall segments will be installed on top of the tier-one segments, making a 10-metre-tall component.
06 December 2017Ten metres tallSecond-tier elements have been installed and the lower cylinder now measures 10 metres in height. In the foreground are elements stored for the base of the cryostat.
27 November 2017Work begins on the upper part of the baseIn November, a traditional "coconut ceremony" heralds the start of welding operations on the base section tier two—a 750-tonne sub-component whose pedestal will support the combined mass of the Tokamak and cryostat (23,000 tonnes).
16 November 2017Impressive work, frequent visitorsSmall groups of visitors to the Cryostat Workshop can be taken out onto tier one of the cryostat base (covered in purple). From there they have a good view on the work to come: welding the tier-two segments, including the heavy rim (shown above their heads here).

17 October 2017Upper rim of the baseThe upper rim of the cryostat base has been installed over the completed lower disk. Work is underway to carefully align the segments.
12 October 2017Lower cylinder: waiting for tier twoThe lower cylinder will weigh 375 tonnes and measure 10 metres in height when tier two is added to tier one. Indian contractor Larsen & Toubro is responsible for the manufacturing design, fabrication and assembly of the ITER cryostat.
12 October 2017Act II for the cryostat baseWelding on the first part of the cryostat base (seen here wrapped in purple) has been successfully completed. Seen directly above, from the inside, is the rim of the six tier two segments that have been carefully aligned.
12 October 2017A giant ringIn the Cryostat Workshop on site, two sections of the cryostat are now under assembly. Here, the team stands inside the ring of the lower cylinder, tier one (30 metres in diameter). An initial pass of the welding tools has all segments now joined; the second tier segments—en route now from India—will top the first, creating a 10-metre-high structure.
12 October 2017The heaviest componentThe six segments of the cryostat base, tier two, have been removed from storage and positioned on pillars above tier one for alignment and welding. The completed cryostat base will create the heaviest single component of the ITER machine ... and one that the Assembly Hall cranes have been sized for.
12 October 2017A pedestal for the machineWhen machine assembly is completed, it won't be a worker sitting here, but the Tokamak itself. These pedestal rings (part of tier two of the cryostat base) will support over 20,000 tonnes of dead weight, including the other cryostat sections, the vacuum vessel and magnets. Pictured here, a technician from Larsen & Toubro contractor MAN is taking precise measurements to align the segments of the base section (tier two).
12 October 2017Seen in profileThe upper part of the cryostat base is seen here in profile, with its wide rim and its interior curved structure.
11 October 2017A lot of weld materialA close-up of the weld gap between two lower cylinder segments. If the camera were to zoom out, we'd see that this V-shape gap is 5 metres high and that there are six welds to realize in total.
29 August 2017A mega componentTier one of the cryostat lower cylinder is now assembled and readied for welding. Standing on the scaffolding of the sub-component, which is 30 metres in diameter, workers appear tiny. (Look closely!)29 August 2017Being exactIn order to reach the required precision in positioning the segments, the most sophisticated technologies alternate with the most basic tools. ITER cryostat engineer Guillaume Vitupier is seen here next to the manual screw jacks used to fine-tune the segments' alignment.
29 August 2017Hard to seeHidden behind all of the scaffolding is the lower cylinder of the cryostat, tier one. A second tier will bring the lower cylinder's height to 10 metres.
