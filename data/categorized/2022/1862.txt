HomeHello! Sh√©:kon! Aloha! Waciye! Tunnagasugitsi!The Initiative for Indigenous Futures (IIF) is a partnership of universities and community organizations dedicated to developing multiple visions of Indigenous peoples tomorrow in order to better understand where we need to go today. Through its four main components ‚Äìworkshops, residencies, symposia, and archive‚Äì IIF encourages and enable artists, academics, youth and elders to imagine how our communities will look in the future. IIF is anchored by Aboriginal Territories in Cyberspace (AbTeC), a research-creation network based at Concordia University, and includes Partners from across Canada.
WorkshopsBringing Aboriginal Storytelling to Experimental Digital MediaThe Skins Workshops teach Indigenous youth how to adapt stories from their community into experimental digital media, such as video games, machinima, 3d modeling and animation, virtual reality, and augmented reality.
ResidenciesEnabling the Future Imagaries of Indigenous Makers and ThinkersThe IIF residency program invites an array of Indigenous artists, writers, activists, thinkers or other makers to envision Indigenous futures. They are asked to consider the question: where would you like to see our people in seven generations?SymposiaExchanging Visions of Indigenous FuturesThe Symposia on the Future Imaginary bring together artists, scholars, community members, knowledge-keepers and technologists from across Canada and internationally to exchange ideas on how Indigenous people imagine themselves in the future. The Symposia are intensely interdisciplinary, and include lectures, workshops, exhibitions, and land-based learning.
ArchiveArchiving Indigenous Digital Media ArtThe Indigenous Digital Art Archive (IDAA) is a project in its early formations and developed by the Initiative for Indigenous Futures (IIF) to organize, care for, and make accessible the records of Indigenous digital artists.
OtherAll the Other Stuff We DoWe conduct a number of other projects that don‚Äôt fall neatly into the four main categories above. This is where you will find information about our speaker series, interviews, work related to the Indigenous Protocol and AI research, a timeline of all of IIF‚Äôs activities since 2013, and various other probes from the future.
