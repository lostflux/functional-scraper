Security Comes First at UK Online Casino Sites!When real money gaming is involved,there‚Äôs nothing more important than the safetyand the fairness of the casino site. The first thing you should do when checking a casino site you haven‚Äôt played at yet is whether or not it‚Äôs licensed by the official gambling authority of the country you‚Äôre residing in. For British players that‚Äôs pretty simple ‚Äì check if it‚Äôs licensed by the United Kingdom Gambling Commission as this is the only organisation that issues remote gambling licences in Great Britain.
Other European countries also havetheir own gambling authorities, but most of them recognise the licences of external institutions as well. Some of the other licences you will often encounter at gambling sites are the ones issued by the Gibraltar Gambling Authority, the Malta Gaming Authority, Antigua & Barbuda‚Äôs Directorate of Offshore Gaming and the Alderney Gambling Control Commission, since taxation and gambling laws in these jurisdictions are more convenient.
UK Gambling Commission LicenceThe Gambling Commission was established under the Gambling Act 2005. It is responsible for regulating gambling in Great Britain. Furthermore, since the introduction of the Gambling (Licensing and Advertising) Act 2014, any operator intending to accept players in Britain must obtain a licence from the Commission. For this reason, British players should only play at UKGC-licensed casinos, as this ensuresthe casino site is operating legally.
Likewise, for players worldwide,a UK licence is a clear signthat an online casino is legit and not a scam site. The key objectives of the UKGC include preventing criminal activity, namely money laundering. They also protect children and vulnerable people from gambling-related harm. The Commission also ensures that gambling is conducted fairly and in an open way. A UKGC licence is the single most reliable way of knowing that a UK casino site is trustworthy. Furthermore, many of thebest casinos in the worldabide by UKGC regulations.
Not only must British online casino sites meet strict standards to obtain a licence, they are also closely regulated to verify that they are maintaining them.
The Gambling Commission carries out assessments on licenseesto ensure that they are complying with the licensing requirements. Operators are regulated according to the licence conditions and codes of practice (LCCP).
This includes everything fromtechnical standards for protecting your personal datato independent testing of games to verify their integrity. It sets clear standards regarding welcome bonus offers, verifying underage gambling is prevented and other player protection measures. The Commission are not shy in upholding these standards either, taking regulatory action in the shape of huge fines or the retraction of gambling licences where operators fail to meet their obligations. On our platform, you can see anUK online casinos listwith all approved operators.
Casino Testing AgenciesFair games are a mustif you want to play with real cash. Yet how can you be confident that the casino slots and table games are not rigged when you play at a UK online casino site? Well, as we mentioned earlier, an operator must invite independent testing of their games as part of licensing and regulatory standards. There are a selection oftrusted independent test housesthat verify the integrity of games. Some of the leading testing agencies include eCOGRA, iTech Labs and GLI.
Such testing authorities perform technical audits of all games and produce payout reports showing how much of all players‚Äô money is returned as winnings across all games on offer at a casino. They perform rigorous testing of the random number generator (RNG) to confirm that game outcomes are trulyrandom and not fixed in any way. Reputable English online casinos will also share these monthly payout reports on their sites, providing transparency and reassurance that the games can be trusted.
Casino AwardsWinning a prestigious industry award speaks volumes about a casino‚Äôs merit. There are a range of awards ceremonies thatrecognise excellence across the online gambling industry.
The most important ones include the Global Gaming Awards, the EGR Awards, the IGA awards and the Global Regulatory Awards.
When we review online casinos, we check out any accolades that have been gained by the operator. With awards that recognise the number one operator, mobile app, game, social responsibility and more, winners of these titles stand out from the crowd. You can find out more aboutthe most important awards in the gambling industrybelow.
Not all good online casinos have such awards but every time you see a casino site that bears one of these awards symbols you can be sure that you are looking at one of the best online casinos on the Internet.

They offer youvarious self-help toolsto manage the time and money you spend gambling.

The UK‚Äôs Most Popular Online Casino Games ‚Äì A Comprehensive ListOne of the most important criteria in finding a top casino site is undoubtedly the game selection on offer. The good thing about online casino operators is that they don‚Äôt have any restrictions in terms of how many games they can add to their sites, unlike brick and mortar casinos. Still,all UK casino sites have different game selectionsdepending on which software houses they work with.
These collections differ in number, quality and diversity, but usually consist for the most part of different video slots, progressive jackpot slots, some table and card games, plus live dealer games. Also, there might be some video poker, scratch cards and arcade games, though not all top online casinos UK players can choose from feature them. You should choose a site that features alarge and diverse game selectionwith the types of games that you want to play.
The Best Online Casino Games in the UK:Most of thetop 20 online casinos UKfeature a great number of the above-listed game types but it‚Äôs always good to consider thatthe variety of online casino games selectionsdiffers greatly from website to website. Let‚Äôs say you want to play Texas Hold‚Äôem Bonus Poker ‚Äì a very specific title. It‚Äôs definitely better to first check if the casino site has the game before registering and depositing.
Another thing that‚Äôs worth checking is theminimum and maximum limitsthat you can bet on a game ‚Äì especially important information for high rollers seeking the best casino sites. If you want to play with the highest stakes, live dealer games are usually the best option.
The Best RTP Casino GamesWhen choosing which games to play at the best UK online casinos, you should keep RTP in mind. The return to player percentage tells you how much a game pays back to players as winnings overall. As such,the higher the RTP, the greater the expectation of profits. Blackjack and video poker games generally feature the highest RTP rates. And as you can see from the list above, some online slots also feature high payout rates.
Best Casino for Online Slot MachinesVisit any online casino websites and you‚Äôll find that online slots dominate the game selection. This is great news for slots players as you will never be stuck for a choice.

You should watch out for any excluded slots or live dealer casino games, and any that have a smaller game weighting towards the bonus wagering requirement. Be aware also that free spins usually have a shorter validity.
Additionally, most of the times the rewarded bonus spins can be played only on specific slots. You shouldalways read all bonus conditionsto be sure you understand the offer before you accept it. That way you can be confident that you are getting a good deal.

The Online Casinos That Pay Out the BestIf you want to win money playing games of chance, then you will no doubt be interesting in learning which UK casino sites have the highest payouts. Each game offered at quality casinos has a theoretical RTP. This return to player percentage expresses how much money bet on the game will be paid back to players over the long run. Whilstcasino slots have a wide range of RTPs, generally speaking, table game variants and video poker offer the possibility of higher returns. Whereas slots with progressive jackpots usually feature a lower RTP.
Licensed casino operators are audited by independent testing agencies every month. These testing bodies produce payout reports that detail the exact percentage of all money bet at the online casino that has been paid out as winnings. As such, you can find the best paying casinos by checking which hasthe highest percentage listed in their payout reports.
Keep in mind that the payout percentage of a casino site will change every month. Yet it is a good guide to finding theonline casinos in the UK that pay out the best. Consideration should also be given to how fast withdrawals are processed, with the highest payout casinos providing swift, hassle-free withdrawals.
The Top Casino Bonus Offers in the UKA real highlight of playing casino games at an online casino site is thegenerous casino bonusesand real money reward offers that you can take advantage of. There is no shortage of deposit offers and welcome bonuses up for grabs, with operators providing a big bonus amount or ticket value to entice you to join. New player bonuses come in all sizes. You will find deals that match your first qualifying deposit with bonus funds. Others come as a package deal, where you earn bonuses over a number of deposits.
Many welcome bonus offers also include free spins for a certain slot game. What they all have in common however is that they extend your playing time and give you more opportunities to win. Below, you can seethe 4 best casino bonus offersthat are currently available for UK players:All top casino sites offer bonuses. And whilst casino promotions and welcome bonuses are undoubtedly an advantage for players, they can also be the cause of complaints. This is because some casino players, particularly new customers, are unfamiliar with thewagering requirements attached to casino offers, and simply choose an offer based on the bonus amount or ticket value.
The playthrough requirementsdetermine how many times you need to play through the welcome bonus before you can withdraw the bonus wins you make with it. Any free spin winnings could also include a wagering requirement. Also important is the weighting of different games and their wagering contributions. Whilst slot games usually count entirely towards welcome bonus wagering, some game types, such as roulette and video poker, tend to have a smaller game weighting, in the region of 10-20%.
Some bonuses exclude some selected games entirely from wagering contributions. It is therefore really important tocheck the bonus terms and conditionsfor favourable conditions for the range of games you want to play. The terms will also list the bonus code or promo code needed to claim an offer if such is required. In ourfull list of the best casino bonuses and latest offers, you will find many examples of welcome bonuses and other casino promotions that are valid for all types of games.
You should also be aware of the minimum amount needed to claim the casino bonuses. Plus,check the validity period, so you know how long you have to meet the wagering requirements before the welcome bonus, extra spins, and bonus wins expire. We should also mention that casino bonuses are not limited to a welcome offer for new customers. The UK‚Äôs top casino sites offer various promotions and loyalty rewards that could enhance your casino experience. You could also benefit from welcome offers, exclusive promo code deals, and entry to a VIP program.
Safe Casino Software with Many Available GamesThe top UK casino sites do not generally power their platforms themselves. Instead, they turn to specialist software providers to create their casino websites. The overall user experience and game availability at an online casino can differ significantly depending on which software an operator uses to power their platform and games.
Reliable software with many gamesis imperative for a casino site to be considered one of the best. Top quality software ensures that the casino platform is fast, intuitive and safe to use, with games that run smoothly without crashing. It also embraces multi-platform gaming, with games working flawlessly on desktop and mobile devices.
We have already mentioned that UK online casinos are subject to strict regulation from the United Kingdom Gambling Commission and other authorities. The same is true of software developers and slot providers. They must alsoadhere to high standards and hold valid licencesto be able to power the best online casino sites and provide games. The software must meet high levels of technical security, ensuring that the player‚Äôs sensitive data is protected, and transactions are encrypted. Games are also independently tested and audited to verify that they are fair.

Customer ServiceAll the best casino sites have 24/7 customer support servicethat is ready to answer any questions and help with any problem at all hours. New customers often fail to check how they can seek help at the casino site until they‚Äôve stumbled upon some issue, which definitely shouldn‚Äôt be the case, especially if they plan on playing for real cash. Therefore, always remember to check the working hours of the casino‚Äôs customer service and whether they support the three most popular methods of contact:Another way that you can find a solution to your problem or an answer to your question is tovisit the FAQ section of the casino site. There, the operators‚Äô specialists collect information about the most common questions and issues players stumble upon, such as what to do if you lose your password, how to make a deposit, what is the game availability and gambling rules, how does ticket value vary, how to sign up for a deposit bonus, or how to claim the extra spins included in a welcome offer.
Both new customers and experienced players are sure to find the FAQ section useful in answering your queries. Most of the best English online casinos have FAQ sections, so make sure tocheck those casino guidesbefore you contact the customer service team.
Casino Credits and CashierOne of the biggest advantages of playing at online casino sites as opposed to at land-based ones is that the former offer you way more opportunities to claim generous casino deposit bonuses. And though there are some free bonuses available, the best welcome bonus offers are the ones that require you to make a qualifying deposit. You can do that by using one of the many payment options that online casinos accept, though it‚Äôs important to know that different UK casino sites supportdifferent online deposit options for British players.
While all operators accept bank transfers and the most popular debit cards such as VISA, Mastercard and Maestro, there are still veryfew gambling sites that accept pay by phone billmobile billing. Also, they usually support some types of e-wallet and prepaid card payments, but not all types.
British players who want to deposit with credit cards should note that deposit method restrictions apply in the UK. In an attempt to prevent problem gambling and improve safety, the UK Gambling Commission has banned the use of credit cards for gambling deposit and withdrawals in the UK. This applies to land based casinos as well as online sites. Here‚Äôs an overview of thesupported payment methods at the top 10 UK online casinos:*Limits may apply from the payment processor.
When deciding which deposit options to use at an online casino, you should pay attention to the deposit limits. Some deposit options, such as prepaid cards and mobile billing have relatively low maximum deposit limits. Others, such as e-wallets and bank transfers tend to feature much higher limits. While limits apply to deposits,no withdrawal limitsare in place at casinos in the UK.
According to UK gambling rules and licensing conditions, an online casino cannot apply limits on how much you can withdraw from your casino player account. Still, withdrawal terms could differ depending on the payment processor. Another detail you should keep in mind when checking the accepted deposit options is thesupported currencies. All players residing in the United Kingdom should, of course, make sure that the casino site supports theBritish Poundwhich should be the case if the casino is really licensed by the UK Gambling Commission.
As for the non-UK players, they should checkif the online casino site supports the currencyof their country. You can still play at a casino site that doesn‚Äôt support your currency as long as it‚Äôs legal in your country, but you should keep in mind that most gambling operators apply small taxes for currency exchange in their deposit and withdrawal terms.
Recommended PayPal CasinosIf you are not certain which method to use, let us recommendPayPal ‚Äì one of the safest and fastest payment methods that online casinos accept. This e-wallet might not be supported by all top online casinos UK players can play at but is a great pick because it allows you toconceal your banking details from the casino, unlike when using debit cards.
On top of that,PayPal supports over 26 currencies, making it a preferred payment method for players from many different countries. Good alternative payment methods to PayPal are Skrill, Neteller and paysafecard. The worst is probably the bank transfer.
