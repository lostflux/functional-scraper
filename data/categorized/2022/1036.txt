Chances Are about 50–50Gauging whether or not we dwell inside someone else’s computer may come down to advanced AI research—or measurements at the frontiers of cosmologyPhysicists Create City-Sized Ultrasecure Quantum NetworkCapable of connecting eight or more users across distances of 17 kilometers, the demonstration is another milestone toward developing a fully quantum InternetQuantum Tunneling Is Not Instantaneous, Physicists ShowA new experiment tracks the transit time of particles burrowing through barriers, revealing previously unknown details of a deeply counterintuitive phenomenonHow Many Aliens Are in the Milky Way? Astronomers Turn to Statistics for AnswersThe tenets of Thomas Bayes, an 18th-century statistician and minister, underpin the latest estimates of the prevalence of extraterrestrial lifeHow Heavy is the Universe? Conflicting Answers Hint at New PhysicsThe discrepancy could be a statistical fluke—or a sign that physicists will need to revise the standard model of cosmologyFaced with a Data Deluge, Astronomers Turn to AutomationFor better or worse, machine learning and big data are poised to transform the study of the heavensThe Quantum Internet Is Emerging, One Experiment at a TimeBreakthrough demonstrations using defective diamonds, high-flying drones, laser-bathed crystals and other exotica suggest practical, unhackable quantum networks are within reachSpin-Swapping Particles Could Be “Quantum Cheshire Cats”A proposed experiment to swap fundamental properties between photons carries profound implications for our understanding of reality itselfFound: A Quadrillion Ways for String Theory to Make Our UniverseStemming from the “F-theory” branch of string theory, each solution replicates key features of the standard model of particle physicsBest-Yet Measurements Deepen Cosmological CrisisThe latest disagreement over the universe’s expansion rate suggests researchers may be on the threshold of revolutionary discoveriesHas LIGO Seen Galaxy-Warped Gravitational Waves?Nobel laureate George Smoot claims LIGO has observed amplified signals of black hole mergers from the very distant universe, but LIGO scientists disagreeWhat Does Quantum Theory Actually Tell Us about Reality?Nearly a century after its founding, physicists and philosophers still don’t know—but they’re working on it...
