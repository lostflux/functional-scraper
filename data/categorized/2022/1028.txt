AdvertisementPhotogearing as a concept for translation of precise motions at the nanoscaleNature Chemistry(2022)Cite this article2341Accesses144AltmetricMetricsdetailsSubjectsAbstractOne of the major challenges for harnessing the true potential of functional nano-machinery is integrating and transmitting motion with great precision. Molecular gearing systems enable the integration of multiple motions in a correlated fashion to translate motions from one locality to another and to change their speed and direction. However, currently no powerful methods exist to implement active driving of gearing motions at the molecular scale. Here we present a light-fuelled molecular gearing system and demonstrate its superiority over passive thermally activated gearing. Translation of a 180° rotation into a 120° rotation is achieved while at the same time the direction of the rotation axis is shifted by 120°. Within such photogearing processes, precise motions at the nanoscale can be changed in direction and decelerated in a manner similar to macroscopic bevel-gear operations in an energy consuming way—a necessary prerequisite to employ gearing as an active component in future mechanical nano-systems.

MainControl of molecular motions represents the basis for virtually all application-driven chemistry fields, but especially for building molecular machines and functional nanotechnology from the bottom up1,2,3,4,5. Substantial progress has been made in this endeavour with the developments of molecular switches6, rotors7,8, walkers9,10, gyroscopes, or pumps11,12and especially motors13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27. However, at present a standing challenge for further advances is the integration, transmission and translation of molecular motions with the greatest precision28,29,30. Due to the presence of the ‘Brownian storm’, defined motions at molecular scales are very effectively equilibrated and randomized. Long-range coupling and scaling up31,32,33,34,35,36, translation of one defined motion into another one37,38,39,40,41, or even power-stroke mechanisms42are therefore inherently difficult tasks at nanometre sizes. One important fundamental concept that should be considered for translating small scale motions is molecular gearing7,43,44,45in which intermeshed molecular fragments move in concert with each other. However, different from the macroscopic world, gearing processes are exceptionally hard to realize in the molecular world as here friction and inertia do not play an important role. As a consequence, slipping processes that evade true gearing are the rule rather than the exception even in highly intermeshed and sterically hindered molecular systems7.
So far, mechanically controlled molecular systems have been developed, ranging from more simple molecular brakes46,47to truly geared systems in which different molecular fragments or entities move in concert because of their tight intermeshing (see refs.
48,49,50,51,52,53for selected examples). More recent progress has allowed switching of gearing in an ON/OFF fashion54. Related molecular systems are able to control the speed of a particular sub-motion via switching processes55,56. However, to the best of our knowledge functional gearing systems put forward so far are not powered directly by an energy source, although most recent efforts are moving in this direction57,58. Instead, their motions are the result of thermal fluctuations and thus they are intrinsically passive and non-directional.
In this Article, we present a novel concept enabling energy powered molecular gearing (Fig.
1). Visible light is used as an energy source, actively fuelling different gearing processes at the nanoscale within hemithioindigo59,60(HTI)-photogear1. We directly show that, different to a thermal gearing process, photogearing can be by far the dominating motion within a molecular framework. At the same time, translation of a 180° double bond isomerization (DBI) into a 120° single bond rotation (SBR) is achieved by the employed bevel-gearing mechanism. Thus, a highly challenging precision shift in the motion character (two-step to three-step for a full rotation) as well as spatial reorientation (120° angling) of the powered motion is demonstrated with our molecular system. We expect great prospects for the concept of photogearing, which allows the problems of thermal gearing systems to be alleviated and enables direct fuelling of geared motions and the precise shifting of molecular motions. Such precision control at the smallest scales will be of great value to anyone interested in using ordered motions for governing functions in chemical/nano systems. Therefore, this approach will strongly facilitate future research in many fields, not least in integrated nanomachinery.

c, HTI-photogear1represents a molecular 2:3 bevel gear undergoing simultaneous rotation of the double bond (red) and the adjacent single bond (blue) upon irradiation. As a result, theEtoZphotoisomerization (180° rotation) is coupled to a 120° rotation of the adjacent triptycene fragment. Photogearing is evidenced directly by quantifying light-induced interconversions between thermally stable individual diastereomers of1.
Results and discussionConformational analysisHTI-based molecular gearing system1inherits a highly intermeshed non-symmetric triptycene moiety, which is introduced as a fourth substituent next to ap-anisole at the photoisomerizable double bond (Fig.
1c). Due to the close proximity of the thioindigo and triptycene molecular fragments, their effective intermeshing is achieved. Thep-anisole substitution was used mainly for two reasons: (1) to increase steric hindrance in the system via a demanding phenyl substituent geminal to the triptycene and (2) to add electron density to the chromophore system (especially via the methoxy substituent) for shifting absorption in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum and generally improving photochemical responses. The synthesis of this sterically strongly hindered system was accomplished using a recently reported method developed in our laboratory for the synthesis of sterically crowded HTI motors, proceeding in eight linear steps (see Supplementary Section1)61.
HTI-photogear1can adopt six distinct states. Three triptycene rotamers are accessible in bothZandEisomeric forms. Based on the symmetry of the triptycene fragment, two of the three states represent enantiomers and thus are not readily observed with classical spectroscopy methods, resulting in four distinct diastereomeric states overall. However, for the elucidation of different possible rotations and particularly the gearing processes it was not necessary to study individual enantiomers as both give rise to the same behaviour. We label the four distinct isomers (depicted in Fig.
2) asA,rac-B(comprised ofBand enantiomericB′),Candrac-D(comprised ofDand enantiomericD′). IsomersAandrac-Binherit aZ-configured isomerizable double bond and correspondingly isomersCandrac-Dinherit anE-configured double bond. Crystals suitable for X-ray analysis were obtained for isomersAandC, facilitating direct assignment of solution spectral species (Fig.
2a). A detailed analysis of solution NMR spectra allowed us to further assign individual signals to the isomer structures (Supplementary Section2).

Source dataAs outlined in Figs.
1–3, the molecular setup of HTI-photogear1allows coupled gearing motions to be distinguished from sole uncoupled/slipping bond rotations, as each process leads to interconversion between two different isomeric states. For example, a gearing motion between the triptycene fragment and the thioindigo fragment can directly be observed as a concomitant transition from isomerAtorac-Dor from isomerCtorac-B(example shown in Fig.
1c) and vice versa. For animated visualizations of exemplary gearing motions leading from isomerCto isomerB′(clockwise motion of the double bond), from isomerCto the enantiomeric isomerB(anticlockwise motion of the double bond), from isomerDto isomerA(clockwise motion of the double bond), or from isomerDto isomerB′(anticlockwise motion of the double bond), see Supplementary Videos1–4, respectively. On the other hand, sole SBR of the triptycene fragment would result in interconversion between isomersAandrac-Bor between isomersCandrac-Dand sole DBI would lead to interconversion between isomersAandCor suitable enantiomers ofrac-Bandrac-D. However, conversion from isomerrac-Btorac-Dand vice versa would be ambiguous as, in this case, a sole DBI and a gearing motion would lead to a population of different respective enantiomers, which are not distinguished by conventional spectroscopy.
Thermal propertiesA first thermal analysis of the HTI-photogear system1was conducted experimentally to elucidate its ground-state energy profile and the corresponding thermally activated motions (Fig.
2b–e). To this end,1H NMR spectroscopy was used as the analytical tool allowing individual isomer concentration changes to be monitored directly at different temperatures in the dark (for corresponding spectra and kinetic analyses see Supplementary Sections4.1and4.2). Pronounced heating of anE-isomer-enriched C2D2Cl4solution at elevated temperatures (120–145 °C) over prolonged time produced different equilibrium mixtures. For temperatures between 120 and 135 °C, the four isomersA,rac-B,Candrac-Dcould still be distinguished in the1H NMR spectrum and their respective ratios could be determined. Using the relationship between the equilibrium constant and the standard Gibbs free energy change, the corresponding energy differences (ΔG) between isomersCandA(as the most stable isomers of each double bond configurationEandZ, respectively) were obtained. Extrapolation to 30 °C gave ΔG= 1.36 kcal mol−1betweenCandAisomers. Kinetic analyses of the thermalEtoZconversions at different temperatures allowed the corresponding Gibbs energy of activation ΔG‡= 38.9 kcal mol−1for this process at 30 °C to be obtained by extrapolation.
Separate thermal isomer interconversion experiments for eitherZ- orE-configured rotamers were conducted at different lower temperatures in CD2Cl2solution (Fig.
2b–dand Supplementary Section4.1). They revealed isomerAto be the thermodynamically most stable state overall. Additionally, a highly selective conversion between exclusively isomersrac-BandAtakes place. When starting from arac-B-enriched solution, thermal activation at temperatures between −10 and 80 °C in the dark only leads to a population of isomerA, providing evidence for sole SBR around the triptycene-connecting single bond. The different final equilibrium ratios ofA:rac-Bat the different measurement temperatures established an energy difference between the degenerated energy levels ofrac-BandAof 0.62 kcal mol−1(extrapolated to 30 °C). Kinetic analysis of this thermal SBR at different temperatures gave the corresponding Gibbs energies of activation and a value of ΔG‡= 20.8 kcal mol−1was obtained for this motion at 30 °C. Similarly, the thermal behaviour of theE-configured isomersCandrac-Dwas scrutinized at different temperatures between 10 and 80 °C in CD2Cl2solution. Again, thermal interconversion between only these two isomers takes place and the degenerated energy levels ofrac-Dwere found to be 0.71 kcal mol−1higher in energy compared to those ofCat 30 °C. An associated Gibbs energy of activation ΔG‡= 22.2 kcal mol−1was determined for this thermal SBR. Taking these data together, the whole ground-state energy profile of HTI-photogear1could experimentally be quantified (Fig.
2e). It was further found that exclusively slipping motions—that is sole SBRs around the triptycene axis and no coupled gearing motions between the triptycene and thioindigo fragment—are present under thermal activation. The thermal slipping of triptycene-containing molecular gear systems is a frequently observed phenomenon, which often interferes with or even outcompetes the desired gearing processes—a problem that lies at the heart of molecular gear research and has recently received fresh attention7,43,50,62,63,64.
Photophysical and photochemical propertiesThe photophysical and photochemical properties of HTI-photogear1were determined next. The individual absorptions of isomersA,rac-B,Candrac-Din different solvents show pronounced absorptions in the visible range of the electromagnetic spectrum and a rather weak negative photochromism (E-configured isomersCandrac-Dpossess slightly hypsochromic absorption compared to theZ-configured isomersAandrac-B; spectra are shown in Supplementary Section4.3). The negative photochromism of1reflects the typical behaviour of HTI photoswitches where isomers with the aromatic substituent (p-anisole in this case) incisrelation to the carbonyl (isomersAandrac-B) possess red-shifted absorption compared to isomers with atransrelation of these groups (isomersCandrac-D)59. Due to weak photochromism and similar quantum yields (see below), photoirradiation with 420 nm light produces a photostationary state with all isomers present, that is a ratio ofA:rac-B:C:rac-D= 20:48:6:26 at −40 °C. Under continuous irradiation all isomers can thus undergo photoreactions as they all absorb the incoming light. For a gearing system such behaviour is, in general, advantageous as it allows continuous operation under irradiation with single wavelength light. However, up to three different productive transformation processes leading to different isomer interconversions—and corresponding different modes of motion—are possible for each isomer.
Therefore, to obtain quantitative insights into the actual light-induced motions of HTI-photogear1it was necessary to elucidate the individual isomer photoreactions. To this end we used a Markov-matrix kinetic analysis (Fig.
3a), similar to a previously reported methodology19,65, in combination with measurements of the initially produced photoproducts. In this approach, solutions significantly enriched in each isomer are needed as the starting points of irradiation experiments. Selective isomer enrichment was possible either by crystallization to enrich isomersAandC, or by low-temperature (−30 °C) HPLC separation and isolation of thermally labile isomersrac-Bandrac-Dprior to the actual irradiation experiments, as outlined in detail in Supplementary Section4.5. In this way we could establish four different starting points for irradiations with either 95%A, 64%rac-B, 94%C, or 72%rac-Dbeing present initially. Two additional isomeric mixtures were used to create two more distinct starting points (Supplementary Figs.
66and69). These different CD2Cl2solutions were cooled to –40 °C to inhibit any thermally activated bond rotations within HTI-photogear1, which could otherwise overshadow the pure photochemical behaviour. Irradiation at –40 °C was conducted inside the NMR spectrometer with the aid of a fibre-coupled 420 nm light-emitting diode and the progress of isomerization was followed by measuring1H NMR spectra at one-minute time intervals (Fig.
3b–e). In this way the photoconversion kinetics could be followed in detail over prolonged irradiation times without interference from thermal reactions. The relative propensities for isomer interconversions could be obtained directly from Markov-matrix analysis and simulation of the kinetic data (Supplementary Sections4.5and4.6). Very good agreement of simulated conversions and experimental data was obtained for this analysis. These results unequivocally show significant photogearing for bothZ- andE-isomeric1. For theE-isomeric rotamerC, photogearing is in fact the dominating process. IsomerCundergoes photogearing with more than twofold higher propensity than the combined sole DBI of the thioindigo fragment and sole SBR of the triptycene moiety. This behaviour is obvious even without Markov-matrix analysis as irradiation of theC-enriched solution leads to a very steep increase in the concentration of therac-Bisomer (the photogearing product) compared to the much slower changes for all other isomers.
a, Measured quantum yields for the photoconversions of individual isomers of HTI-photogear1. The thickness of the arrows indicates the relative conversion propensities. Photoreactions, using in situ irradiation within the NMR spectrometer, were measured by1H NMR (400 MHz) spectroscopy in CD2Cl2solution at −40 °C. Photoquantum yields forZtoEconversions and vice versa were measured using a combined method of photon counting and1H NMR (400 MHz) spectroscopy in CD2Cl2. Afterwards, the conversion propensities of individual isomers were scaled to the quantum yields measured for DBI. The panel on the left meets the middle of the skewed panel on the right to signify that photoreactions fromAandClead to populations of both pairs of enantiomers (B/B′andD/D′).

Source dataTo obtain absolute values for the different photoconversion processes, quantum yields were measured at −40 °C (Fig.
3f,g). For this purpose a combination of photon counting and1H NMR spectroscopy was used to quantify the photoconversions betweenZ- andE-isomeric1(for details see Supplementary Sections4.7and4.8). When taking into account the relative photoconversion propensities as elucidated by Markov-matrix analysis, the quantum yields for all observable photoisomerization reactions within HTI-photogear1could be obtained. For all photoconversion processes, sizeable quantum yields of up to 6.8% were obtained as shown in Fig.
3a. As can be seen from the data, slipping motions are dominant in theZ-configured isomers leading to pronounced sole DBI (ϕ(AtoC) = 2%) and SBR (ϕ(Atorac-B) = 5.9% andϕ(rac-BtoA) = 0.8%) in isomersAandrac-B. Nevertheless, a clear propensity for a photogearing motion is also observed, in which both the central double bond and the adjacent single bond connecting to the triptycene fragment are rotated at the same time by 180° and 120°, respectively. This motion leads to conversion fromAtorac-Dor fromrac-BtoCwith quantum yields ofϕ(Atorac-D) = 2% andϕ(rac-BtoC) = 0.4%. The ambiguous motion fromrac-Btorac-Doccurs withϕ(rac-Btorac-D) = 2%.
In theE-configured isomersCandrac-D, photogearing is much more pronounced and the slipping motions are reduced significantly. For isomerC, DBI and SBR are decreased toϕ(CtoA) = 1.4% for the former andϕ(Ctorac-D) = 1.6% for the latter. For isomerrac-D, the corresponding quantum yield for SBR isϕ(rac-DtoC) = 0.3%. The photogearing motion between the central double bond and the adjacent single bond connecting to the triptycene fragment is most pronounced and dominant for isomerC, which has the highest overall quantum yield,ϕ(Ctorac-B) = 6.8%, measured in this system. The corresponding photogearing motion is also quite pronounced in therac-Disomer with a quantum yield ofϕ(rac-DtoA) = 2.2%. For therac-Disomer, the ambiguous motion fromrac-Dtorac-Boccurs withϕ(rac-Dtorac-B) = 3%. Photoinduced SBRs between the enantiomers ofrac-Bandrac-D(indicated by dashed grey arrows in Fig.
3a) are not visible in the experiments conducted.
Taking these numbers together, a clear influence of the starting geometry on the effectiveness of photogearing can thus be discerned in HTI-photogear system1. In theE-isomeric forms, photogearing represents a strongly favoured process, as is directly observed for isomerC, for which all other possible photoconversion pathways are unambiguously discernible. For the otherE-configuredrac-Disomer, photogearing is also observed as the preferred photoconversion pathway. In this case the total quantum yield for photogearing could even be higher if suitable enantiomers ofrac-Bandrac-Dinterconvert (indicated with grey diagonal arrows in Fig.
3a). This photogearing selectivity of theEisomers can in part be attributed to better intermeshing of the carbonyl group within the triptycene pocket. For theZ-isomeric states the sulfur atom establishes an inferior intermeshing between the thioindigo and triptycene fragments, which is directly observed by comparison of the molecular structures ofAandCin the crystalline state (Fig.
2a). However, electronic effects are likely to also play an important role as steric hindrance and intermeshing in HTI-photogear1is clearly not enough to allow thermal gearing to have any effect. Therefore, a distinctly different behaviour between ground state and excited state motions is observed, indicating a mechanistically different origin of the corresponding molecular rotations.
When comparing total quantum yields it becomes apparent that bothZandEisomers behave similarly and about 10% overall photoisomerization quantum yield is obtained for bothAandC. Since the SBR photoreactions of isomersrac-Bandrac-Dare obscured their total quantum yields are not known for comparison. However, it is interesting to note that the position of the triptycene moiety influences the propensity to undergo a specific photoreaction. Comparing isomerCwithrac-Dfor example, photogearing proceeds with 6.8% quantum yield for the former, while for the latter only a maximum of 5.2% is possible (ifϕ(rac-Dtorac-B) = 3.0% is fully allocated to photogearing). Additionally, SBR for the conversion fromCtorac-Dis significantly more effective (1.6%) than the reverse reaction (0.3%). Similarly, SBR fromAtorac-Bis also much more efficient (5.9%) than the reverse reaction (0.8%). Again, electronic effects are expected to strongly affect these processes since the triptycene blades are electronically distinct due to their substitutions.
ConclusionsIn summary, we have demonstrated a distinct and potent concept—photogearing—for actively powering the precise translation of molecular motions. In our HTI-photogearing system1, the 180° rotation of a planar thioindigo fragment is translated into a 120° rotation of a non-symmetric triptycene fragment. Therefore, a two-to-three translation of molecular motions is achieved by the correlated gearing process. At the same time the geared motions of the two molecular fragments are angled by about 120°, similar to macroscopic bevel-gear arrangements. The gearing motion is actively driven by the energy input of blue light irradiation and is shown to be dominating the light-induced rotations ofE-configured isomers. By contrast, the thermal behaviour is distinctly different and only slipping motions, that is uncorrelated motions between individual molecular fragments, are observed. Thus, with photogearing it is possible to establish effective and actively powered gearing motions at the nanoscale using light as external fuel. We are convinced that more sophisticated gearing systems can now be devised that translate precise molecular motions over longer distances, in different directions and with different speeds akin to integrated macroscopic gearing systems. Our study provides a distinct method for manipulating precise molecular motions and should open up a plethora of new possibilities and design concepts for the creation of future integrated nano-machinery. Our current efforts are further directed at establishing directionality in photogearing processes.
