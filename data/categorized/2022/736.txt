AdvertisementEarth’s missing argon paradox resolved by recycling of oceanic crustNature Geosciencevolume15,pages85–90 (2022)Cite this article1836Accesses5AltmetricMetricsdetailsSubjectsAbstractThe extent to which primordial mantle domains have survived billions of years of convective mixing is a fundamental question in mantle dynamics and geochemistry. The observation that around half of Earth’s40Ar is missing from the atmosphere has been used to argue for a largely primordial, convectively isolated lower mantle. This hypothesis is apparently supported by lower40Ar/36Ar ratios in the mantle source of ocean-island basalts compared with mid-ocean-ridge basalts. However, strongly layered convection is contradicted by seismic tomographic observations and geodynamic constraints. Using joint geodynamic–geochemical modelling of mantle convection, we show that high40Ar concentrations associated with K-rich subducted oceanic crust plus unmelted material dispersed throughout the mantle can fully account for Earth’s40Ar budget. This solution to the missing Ar paradox requires neither a substantial reduction in Earth’s assumed K concentration nor large isolated domains in the mantle. We additionally show that subducted atmosphere-derived Ar has little effect on the mantle40Ar budget but can substantially reduce mantle40Ar/36Ar ratios. Unlike He and Ne isotope systems, whose variations reflect primarily incorporation of primordial material, mantle40Ar/36Ar ratios may instead result from subduction of atmosphere-derived Ar into the deep mantle.

MainTerrestrial processes associated with mantle convection and plate tectonics continually modify the chemistry of Earth’s mantle, crust and atmosphere. Radiogenic noble gases produced by long-lived radioactive parents are sensitive tracers of the dynamic history of the mantle and of the exchange of volatiles between Earth’s interior and exterior. The K–Ar system (40K →40Ar, half-life 1.25 Gyr) is particularly well suited to study the extent of outgassing and hence mantle processing rate over Earth history. Specifically, the observation that much of Earth’s radiogenic40Ar does not reside in the atmosphere has been interpreted to indicate that massive mantle domains have remained unprocessed by partial melting and degassing1,2.
Because nearly all terrestrial40Ar is produced from40K decay, the fraction of40Ar accounted for by the atmospheric budget depends only on the assumed bulk silicate Earth (BSE) K concentration. For a BSE K concentration between 190 and 280 ppm, only ~40−60% of Earth’s40Ar is in the atmosphere (Extended Data Figure1). The continental crust and upper mantle contain at most a few percent of Earth’s40Ar2. The substantial portion of Earth’s40Ar not accounted for by the atmosphere, crust and upper mantle has been termed ‘missing Ar’2.
The conventional explanation for the large amount of missing Ar is that it resides in mantle domains that have not been subject to partial melting and degassing1,2. This simple explanation has been used as evidence for convective isolation of the upper and lower mantle, with the lower mantle remaining largely primordial.
40Ar/36Ar ratios in mid-ocean-ridge basalts (MORBs) and ocean-island basalts (OIBs) appear to support this explanation: MORBs tend to have higher40Ar/36Ar ratios than OIBs3, which by analogy to4He/3He and21Ne/22Ne could reflect a higher degree of processing and outgassing of the MORB mantle compared with the OIB mantle. However, strongly layered convection is inconsistent with seismological observations of material exchange between the upper and lower mantle via slabs4and plumes5, as well as geodynamic evidence6,7,8, which presents a paradox.
Previously proposed resolutions to this missing Ar paradox fall into two classes: either material exchange between the upper and lower mantle is relatively limited9,10or the BSE K concentration has been overestimated11,12,13. In this article, we demonstrate the plausibility of the hypothesis that40Ar produced from40K decay within ancient oceanic crust sequestered in the deep mantle alleviates the need for either an isolated primordial reservoir or reduction of the BSE K concentration. We also demonstrate that recycling of atmosphere-derived Ar into the mantle, rather than preservation of undegassed domains, may be a critical factor controlling mantle36Ar concentrations and40Ar/36Ar variability.
Models of K–Ar in whole-mantle convectionWe utilize models of thermochemical mantle convection in a cylindrical geometry14with tracers tracking40K,40Ar and36Ar compositions (Fig.
1and Methods). Because the K–Ar system speaks directly to the time-integrated mantle processing history over 4.55 Gyr, the models used match Earth’s convective vigour expressed as plate speeds, surface heat flow and melting rates. It is crucial to include the effect of oceanic crust subduction on the K–Ar system as K is strongly concentrated into the oceanic crust during partial melting. We assume five different values for the relative density excess of oceanic crust to average mantle dlnρ(= dρ/ρ)—2.6%, 3.8%, 4.5%, 5.1% and 6.4%—and refer to these as models dlnρ26, dlnρ38, dlnρ45, dlnρ51 and dlnρ6415. These five models simulate 4.55 Gyr of solid mantle convection with similar and Earth-like convective vigour. In a sixth model, dlnρ64ts, we rescale the dlnρ64 model time to simulate enhanced early convective vigour (Methods).
Results here are for the dlnρ64 model; other models are shown in Supplementary Figs.
13–16.
a, Distribution of unmelted (yellow) and melted (red, blue) tracers. The lowermost mantle is dominated by processed (melted) material whereas primordial (unmelted) material is distributed throughout the mantle.
b, Age (time since last melting) of oceanic crust (eclogite tracers). Young crust traverses the mantle quickly and accumulates near the core–mantle boundary.
c, Distribution of40K. Subducting oceanic crust delivers40K to the lower mantle where it eventually decays to40Ar.
d, Distribution of40Ar.
40Ar is absent from young subducted crust but is present in areas of primordial mantle and ancient oceanic crust.
40Ar derived from subducted40K in ancient oceanic crust alleviates the need for all the mantle’s missing Ar to reside in primordial domains.
e, Distribution of36Ar. In addition to primordial domains, high36Ar concentrations are associated with subducted oceanic crust due to atmosphere-derived Ar incorporated into the subducting crust.
f, Distribution of40Ar/36Ar ratios.
40Ar/36Ar variations largely reflect variations in subducted atmosphere-derived Ar, suggesting atmosphere-derived Ar exerts a strong control on mantle40Ar/36Ar ratios. Measured MORB and OIB ranges3are indicated on the colour bar. Several hundred proximal tracer compositions are averaged to aid visualization inc–f.
An important feature of our modelling set-up is that the geochemical modelling is performed as an efficient post-processing step independent of the computationally much more expensive geodynamic modelling. This allows us to explore wide ranges of geochemical parameters rather than assuming values a priori. We use a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) procedure to constrain six geochemical parameters, resulting in models optimally matching the major observations of the K–Ar system (Methodsand Supplementary Figs.
1–12). These parameters are the initial distribution of36Ar between the mantle and atmosphere (fraction of36Ar initially in the mantle,\({\phi }_{\,{{\mbox{Ar}}}\,}^{{\mathrm{mantle}}}\)); the Archaean (0–2 Gyr,\({E}_{\,{{\mbox{K}}}\,}^{1}\)) and post-Archaean (2.00–4.55 Gyr,\({E}_{\,{{\mbox{K}}}\,}^{2}\)) efficiency of K extraction from subducting oceanic crust to the continental crust (where 0 Gyr is the model start and 4.55 Gyr is the present day); the efficiency of K and Ar recycling from the continental crust and atmosphere to the mantle (RKandRAr); and the BSE K concentration (KBSE). Models employing optimized parameter values (listed in Table1) are summarized in Supplementary Tables1–6and are the basis for our analysis.
Missing Ar in ancient oceanic crustThe crux of the missing Ar paradox is the presumption that radiogenic40Ar in the mantle resides in primordial domains that have not lost their Ar to the atmosphere, requiring a large amount of preserved primordial mantle2. However, our models explore the previously overlooked possibility that some mantle40Ar may instead be associated with ancient oceanic crust rather than primordial material. Ancient oceanic crust has long been recognized as crucial to mantle geodynamics and geochemistry16,17,18.
Accumulation of radiogenic40Ar in ancient oceanic crust occurs as long as some K is retained in subducting oceanic crust. Although highly incompatible elements such as K are strongly concentrated in the continental crust, they may also be abundant in ancient oceanic crust19. During mid-ocean-ridge melting, K is efficiently transferred from residual mantle lithosphere to the oceanic crust. K is further enriched in the upper crust during low-temperature seafloor alteration20. Some K loss from dykes and gabbros may occur during high-temperature alteration, although much of the original K is likely to remain20. While K in the upper crust may be released to the mantle wedge through dehydration or melting during subduction, the lower crust is less susceptible to these effects21. Therefore, retention of some K in oceanic crust through subduction is expected.
In our models, K is retained in subducting oceanic crust as long as the extraction efficiency parameters are less than 1. In the MCMC trials, post-Archaean K extraction parameters (\({E}_{\,{{\mbox{K}}}\,}^{2}\)) are generally greater than 0.5 (Table1), commensurate with its high incompatibility and fluid mobility. Archaean K extraction parameters (\({E}_{\,{{\mbox{K}}}\,}^{1}\)) vary from 0 to 1 and strongly negatively correlate with the BSE K concentrations (Supplementary Figs.
7–12). This negative correlation probably reflects the use of the continental crust K concentration as a constraint—if the BSE K concentration were increased, the extraction efficiency must decrease to match the continental crust K content. However, the probability of\({E}_{\,{{\mbox{K}}}\,}^{1}\)and\({E}_{\,{{\mbox{K}}}\,}^{2}\)being simultaneously close to 1 is very low (Supplementary Figs.
7–12).
An increase in K extraction efficiency from the Archaean to post-Archaean (\({E}_{\,{{\mbox{K}}}}^{2} > {E}_{{{\mbox{K}}}\,}^{1}\)) may appear to contradict other models based on the K–Ar system where continental crust grew rapidly in the Archaean to near its present mass22,23. However, we note that those models also merely consider the extraction of K to the continental crust. Therefore, inefficient Archaean K extraction does not obviate early continental crust growth; it could instead indicate that early continental crust was relatively K poor, consistent with observations that the continental crust became more felsic over time24,25.
Some K may also be eroded from the continents and recycled with subducting slabs26. The correlation between the extent of continental crustal K recycling (RK) and the post-Archaean K extraction efficiency (\({E}_{\,{{\mbox{K}}}\,}^{2}\)) (Supplementary Figs.
7–12) also likely results from use of the continental crust K concentration as a model constraint. The lack of correlation betweenRKand\({E}_{\,{{\mbox{K}}}\,}^{1}\)may be because the K content of the continental crust remains low early in the models.
Any40K remaining in oceanic crust through subduction eventually decays to40Ar, creating a reservoir of mantle40Ar independent of primordial material. This reservoir is substantial in our best-fit models—almost 40% of the mantle40Ar resides in ancient oceanic crust rather than unmelted mantle (Supplementary Tables1–6). Consequently, the fraction of primordial (unmelted) mantle is substantially lower than the fraction of missing Ar (Fig.
2a,b; see also ref.
27). For example, in the dlnρ64 model, almost half of Earth’s40Ar is in the mantle, yet only a quarter of the mantle mass is unmelted (Supplementary Table5). Our models therefore demonstrate that production and storage of40Ar from40K in ancient oceanic crust alleviates the requirement for all mantle40Ar to reside in large isolated primordial domains, providing a simple resolution to the missing Ar paradox.
a, By 4.55 Gyr, 74–84% of the mantle mass has been melted at least once, meaning only 16–26% remains primordial.
b, The fraction of degassed40Ar is lower than the fraction of unmelted mantle due to40Ar storage in subducted oceanic crust. This negates the requirement for large volumes of primordial material to account for Earth’s missing Ar.
c, The fraction of mantle36Ar subducted from the atmosphere is substantial (64–80% by 4.55 Gyr), but the fraction of40Ar is negligible (<1%). Due to their relative40Ar/36Ar ratios, subduction much more strongly affects mantle36Ar than40Ar.
Unmelted material in our models is not concentrated in the lower mantle, but rather distributed throughout the mantle (Fig.
1a). This is because slabs quickly penetrate vertically to the lower mantle, displacing older material upwards14(Methods). While this whole-mantle convection endmember behaviour may not be entirely realistic and could have other unintended geochemical consequences19, it raises the possibility that that proposed high-density and primordial lower mantle domains28,29,30may not be needed.
Is Earth’s K concentration overestimated?The BSE K concentration directly determines Earth’s40Ar content and consequently the amount of missing40Ar. Estimates of the BSE K concentration, generally inferred from the BSE U concentration and K/U ratio, range from 190 to 280 ppm (Extended Data Fig.
1). The BSE K/U ratio is often thought to be less certain than the U concentration, and downward revision could reduce the magnitude of the missing Ar paradox11,12,13. The BSE K/U ratio is typically inferred from MORBs31,32, requiring the assumption that K and U do not fractionate during tectonic processes. Lassiter13argued that dehydration during subduction causes subducted oceanic crust to carry particularly low K/U ratio and that the BSE K/U ratio is lower than that estimated from MORBs alone. However, we argue that K/U fractionation during subduction is unlikely to strongly affect the global K and U budgets because the continental crust does not have a complementary high K/U ratio, but rather a ratio similar to the MORB average (Extended Data Fig.
2). We therefore argue that there is no strong evidence for a BSE K/U ratio substantially lower than the MORB value.
Our MCMC procedure allows us to examine the conditions under which different values ofKBSEcan be accommodated rather than assuming any particular value. We find that although lower values (160–200 ppm K) are more probable, higher values are permissible in models with high oceanic crust density (dlnρ) and low initial continental crust extraction efficiency (\({E}_{\,{{\mbox{K}}}\,}^{1}\)) (Table1and Supplementary Fig.
11). Such parameter values restrict K from entering the continental crust such that the crust and atmosphere do not accumulate too much40K and40Ar, respectively. These parameter values are also geologically plausible as ample geophysical and geochemical evidence supports dense oceanic crust accumulation in the lower mantle16,17,18, and inefficient Archaean K extraction to the continental crust is consistent with the geologic record24,25.
We therefore conclude that the missing Ar paradox can be reconciled without a convectively isolated lower mantle and without a particularly low BSE K concentration as long as subducted oceanic crust is dense enough to sequester K (and40Ar) from the rest of the silicate Earth.
Ar subduction explains mantle40Ar/36Ar variabilityThe40Ar/36Ar ratios in the mantle vary by more than any isotope system except4He/3He, but the origin of this extreme variation is not settled. By analogy to4He/3He, less-degassed portions of the mantle would have lower40Ar/36Ar11,33,34. Indeed, OIBs have40Ar/36Ar around 10,000–20,000 whereas MORBs have40Ar/36Ar between 20,000 and 50,0003. However, a global correlation between He and Ar isotopes is quite weak3. Alternatively, low40Ar/36Ar ratios, as well as low129Xe/130Xe ratios, could be due to preferential addition of atmosphere-derived Ar (40Ar/36Ar = 298.6) to the mantle35,36,37,38, perhaps facilitated by incorporation into hydrous minerals during oceanic crust alteration39,40. While the idea of noble gas subduction to the deep mantle had long been opposed41,42, substantial recent work has demonstrated that noble gases can pass through the ‘subduction barrier’3,35,36,43. In addition to exploring whether low40Ar/36Ar ratios are due to primordial material or subducted atmosphere, we investigate whether atmospheric Ar subduction is another possible solution to the missing Ar paradox. Substantial atmosphere-derived40Ar subducted to the deep mantle could alleviate the need for mantle40Ar to reside in primordial domains.
Our models permit but do not require subduction of atmosphere-derived Ar as the Ar recycling efficiency parameter (RAr) can be 0. We find that in the most probable solutions,RAris greater than 0 (Table1) and much of the36Ar ultimately residing in the mantle has been subducted from the atmosphere, yet subducted atmosphere-derived40Ar is almost negligible (Fig.
2c). Because the atmospheric40Ar/36Ar ratio is much lower than that of the mantle, subduction of atmosphere-derived Ar affects36Ar substantially more than40Ar. High36Ar concentrations near the core–mantle boundary are due to subduction of atmosphere-derived Ar, whereas coincident high40Ar concentrations are due to40K decay within ancient oceanic crust (Fig.
1d).
The spatial distribution of40Ar/36Ar ratios strongly mirrors that of36Ar (Fig.
1f), demonstrating that40Ar/36Ar ratios are also modulated by subducted atmosphere-derived Ar. Whereas He and Ne isotopic ratios primarily reflect a mantle domain’s outgassing history, our results support the hypothesis that Ar, Kr and Xe isotope ratios, such as the low40Ar/36Ar and129Xe/130Xe ratios in OIBs and some MORBs, are strongly influenced by subducted atmosphere-derived noble gases35,36,37,38. Although subducting plates carrying atmosphere-derived Ar should also have extremely high (U + Th)/3He and consequently elevated4He/3He ratios, their He concentration is probably too low to overprint low4He/3He in OIBs associated with primordial material (Methods). Therefore, mantle isotopic ratios of He (and Ne) may be effectively decoupled from Ar (and Kr, Xe) as the former are more sensitive to primordial material and the latter are more dependent on subducted atmosphere-derived noble gases.
The amount of atmosphere-derived Ar subduction in our models depends strongly on the initial36Ar distribution between the mantle and atmosphere (\({\phi }_{\,{{\mbox{Ar}}}\,}^{{\mathrm{mantle}}}\)), evidenced by the negative correlations betweenRArand\({\phi }_{\,{{\mbox{Ar}}}\,}^{{\mathrm{mantle}}}\)in the MCMC trials (Supplementary Figs.
7–12). With less36Ar starting in the mantle, more atmospheric Ar subduction is required, and vice versa. But even when Ar subduction is minimal, more than 90% of the36Ar is in the atmosphere at the start of our models (\({\phi }_{\,{{\mbox{Ar}}}\,}^{{\mathrm{mantle}}}\,\)< 0.1).
Our models do not explicitly consider previous events such as late accretion or giant impact-induced catastrophic outgassing. Early outgassing appears to be required by He–Ne44,45, Ar22,46and Xe47,48systematics, and late accretion of Earth’s volatiles has also been advocated49,50. Both of these processes are adequately simulated by low\({\phi }_{\,{{\mbox{Ar}}}\,}^{{\mathrm{mantle}}}\)values because insignificant40Ar is produced during Earth’s accretionary epoch.
Atmospheric40Ar/36Ar evolutionWhile our models are constrained by observations of K and Ar in modern Earth reservoirs, they can also provide predictions for the time evolution of those reservoirs such as the atmospheric40Ar/36Ar ratio. Data from ancient samples22,51,52appear to require higher atmospheric40Ar/36Ar ratios in the past than predicted by our models (Fig.
3), whereas models with faster convective vigour early in Earth history tend to match these observations better22,23,46. Furthermore, faster early convective vigour may be required to explain Pu–U–Xe systematics53,54.
a, Both the constant convective vigour model (dlnρ64) and the enhanced early convective vigour model (dlnρ64ts) match the modern atmospheric composition (red square), but40Ar/36Ar rises faster in the dlnρ64ts model, approaching the ancient atmosphere measurements (grey box22, downward triangle51, upward triangle52).
b, Average plate speeds (500 Myr averages), a proxy for convective vigour, are nearly constant with time in the dlnρ64 model but decrease by a factor of 4 in the dlnρ64ts model.
We explore the potential effects of enhanced early convective vigour by rescaling time in our dlnρ64 model (dlnρ64ts;Methods). Rescaling results in approximately twice faster Hadean–Archaean plate speeds compared with the unscaled model (Fig.
3b). We repeat the MCMC procedure using identical constraints to the unscaled models; that is, atmospheric40Ar/36Ar ratio is not forced to higher values early in the model. The best-fit chemical parameters fit the modern K and Ar data equally well as the unscaled models (Supplementary Fig.
6), and the atmospheric40Ar/36Ar ratio does indeed increase earlier than in the unscaled models (Fig.
3a). The dlnρ64ts model does not quite reach the data due to limitations in the timescaling methodology (Methods), but it demonstrates the plausibility of enhanced early convective vigour explaining the data within the context of a fully dynamic model. It also provides an impetus to develop higher-convective-vigour geodynamic models without timescaling, a current challenge in geodynamic modelling55.
MethodsGeodynamic modellingOur models of thermochemical mantle convection are based on those of Brandenburg et al.
14. Full descriptions of the methodology, equations, initial and boundary conditions, discretization and tests are provided in the original literature14. While these models are relatively simple, they are able to explain a number of isotopic patterns seen in MORB and OIB geochemistry14,56and therefore provide a useful set of models for further hypothesis testing that relies on the principal mechanism of oceanic crust formation, recycling and storage over the age of Earth. Here we briefly summarize the modelling approach, key features, assumptions and limitations.
The models are based on the solution of the time-dependent heat equation coupled to the Stokes and mass-conservation equations under the assumption of the Boussinesq flow, which implies incompressibility and the absence of solid-state phase transitions. The model geometry is a two-dimensional cylindrical shell with a rescaled core–mantle boundary, which enables Earth-like heat transport properties in mantle convection modelling57. The temperature contrast across the mantle is kept constant over geological time. The mantle is assumed to be a Newtonian fluid with three orders of magnitude viscosity variation due to temperature alone with a higher depth-dependent viscosity in the lithosphere and lower mantle. The combined temperature- and depth-dependent effects set up a radially average viscosity profile that is similar to that observed for Earth’s mantle (see references in Brandenburg et al.
14).
Plate-like dynamics are simulated following the approach of Gable et al.
58, which allows for the imposition of kinematic boundary conditions on the Stokes equations that are fully consistent with the dynamics and energetics of the underlying mantle dynamics and allow for models to reach Earth-like convective vigour (see the following). The models’ eight fixed plate boundaries are convergent or divergent depending on the plates’ relative velocities.
The models contain approximately one million passive ‘harzburgite’ tracers and an equal number of ‘eclogite’ tracers with a density excess, all initially evenly spaced throughout the model. Harzburgite tracers contain seven times the volume of eclogite tracers; thus, the initial condition represents a ‘lherzolitic’ mantle. Following previous work59, we use these petrological terms that are defined for the uppermost mantle only throughout to refer to the average mantle composition (lherzolite), the oceanic crust (eclogite) and the depleted residue (harzburgite) while recognizing that mineral phase changes would change this terminology with depth. Five models are utilized, where eclogite tracers (with densityρE) are assumed to have density excesses over lherzolitic mantle (ρL) of dlnρ= (ρE−ρL)/ρL= 2.6%, 3.8%, 4.5%, 5.1% and 6.4%.
Oceanic crust formation is simulated by concentrating the eclogite tracers to the top and harzburgite tracers to the bottom of the melting region when tracers enter a divergent plate boundary. This results in oceanic crust and underlying depleted harzburgite layers of similar thicknesses to the averages of present-day Earth. The separation of eclogite and harzburgite tracers during melting influences the model dynamics due to the density contrast of the eclogite and harzburgite layers. Over time, convective mixing causes a marble-cake pattern of intermixed eclogite and harzburgite.
Since the K–Ar system speaks directly to the processing efficiency of the mantle, it is important that the models match Earth-like convective vigour. The original models14used an identical Rayleigh number for all eclogite density cases, which resulted in the higher eclogite density models becoming slightly more sluggish over time (see fig. 4 of ref.
14). Here, we instead adjust the Rayleigh number for each model such that the convective vigour is Earth-like in that the average plate speeds in the last model 500 Ma are approximately 3 cm yr–1on the basis of the poloidal component of the present-day plate tectonic velocity field60, the surface heat flow is approximately 100 mW m–2(ref.
61) and the mantle processing rate is approximately 1018g yr–1(ref.
62).
For an eclogite density higher than that of lherzolite, subducted oceanic crust piles at the base of the mantle (Fig.
1a,b) forming distinct features similar to large low-shear-velocity provinces seen in seismic tomography15. Accumulation of subducted oceanic crust in a manner similar to our models occurs ubiquitously in models that use alternative mechanisms for generating plate-like surface behaviour and incorporate compressibility and phase changes9,63,64. It also occurs in other model geometries such as rectangles59,65,66, three-dimensional spheres63,64and spherical annuli55. Because our models are used primarily to test the hypothesis that subducted oceanic crust is an important reservoir of Earth’s40Ar, the similar dynamic behaviour observed in models using other assumptions suggests that our conclusions do not depend, to first order, on those assumptions.
By contrast, the details of the mantle flow pattern depend on the model set-up. Despite a higher-viscosity lower mantle, downwellings simulating subducting slabs tend to penetrate quickly from convergent boundaries into the lower mantle. This behaviour is not necessarily reflected in Earth’s mantle and may affect the distribution of geochemical compositions19. We expect that incorporation of mobile plate boundaries, modest mantle compressibility and solid-state phase transitions would slow slab sinking into lower mantle67, potentially changing the timing and location of accumulated subducted oceanic crust. However, these effects would not necessarily change the conclusion that subducted oceanic crust can host substantial40Ar, only the spatio-temporal distribution of that crust. A potentially more important change may occur due to Earth’s thermal evolution, the strongly correlated changes in melt formation at mid-ocean ridges and the details of when and how plate tectonics began. These processes are difficult to constrain because of limited observations and would introduce new free parameters in the models. We plan to explore the role of compressibility and phase transitions, along with thermal evolution models and associated changes in oceanic crust formation, in future work.
Geochemical modellingWe track the concentrations of40K,40Ar and36Ar in each tracer and track the accumulating number of atoms in the continental crust and atmosphere. Tracer compositions are modified by radioactive decay, partial melting and exchange of elements between the oceanic crust, continental crust and atmosphere. For simplicity, we assume that all chemical differentiation occurs at divergent plate boundaries. K and Ar atoms in melting eclogite and harzburgite tracers are transferred to the eclogite tracers (oceanic crust) on the basis of the assumption that K and Ar are perfectly incompatible (D= 0). Assuming instead that K and Ar are highly incompatible (D= 0.0001) and using a batch melting model where the degree of melting is based on the ratio of melting eclogite to harzburgite tracers14(a proxy for mantle fertility) has no consequential effect on our results. Some fraction of K in the melting eclogite tracers is extracted to the continental crust controlled by the parameterEK, and some fraction of continental crust K is recycled back by the parameterRK14,56. Following ref.
14, we allow the value ofEKto change after the Archaean:\({E}_{\,{{\mbox{K}}}\,}^{1}\)from 0 to 2 Gyr and\({E}_{\,{{\mbox{K}}}\,}^{2}\)from 2 to 4.55 Gyr. However, we note that this procedure models only K extraction to the continental crust, not the growth of continental crust itself. We assume that Ar is efficiently extracted to the atmosphere and that some atmospheric Ar may be recycled to the melting eclogite tracers by the parameterRAr. The continental crust accumulates40Ar from in situ40K decay, which outgases to the atmosphere after a 500 Myr residence time. This delay simulates40Ar outgassing associated with crustal reworking and is chosen on the basis that crustal K–Ar ages tend to be a few hundred Myr younger than Rb–Sr ages68. The total Earth36Ar content is set to 3.32 × 1039atoms on the basis of the present-day atmospheric budget69,70, considering that the majority of Earth’s36Ar is in the atmosphere71. This budget is initially partitioned between the atmosphere and mantle by the parameter\({\phi }_{\,{{\mbox{Ar}}}\,}^{{\mathrm{mantle}}}\). The Earth is assumed to start with zero40Ar because nonradiogenic terrestrial40Ar is negligible72.
Parameter estimationOur chemical modelling contains a number of parameters (described in the preceding) that influence the K–Ar evolution. We find values of these parameters that reproduce the major observations from the K–Ar system using MCMC sampling. The main advantage of MCMC sampling over traditional Monte Carlo sampling is that MCMC sampling can estimate the most likely parameter values, their variances and covariances, whereas traditional Monte Carlo sampling can identify only permissible parameter values. In addition, unguided Monte Carlo sampling is much more computationally expensive than MCMC sampling.
Our MCMC sampling finds parameter sets that minimize the misfit between modelled and observed atmospheric40Ar, continental crust40K content, atmospheric40Ar/36Ar ratio and bulk mantle40Ar/36Ar ratio (Supplementary Table7). The log-likelihood function minimized in MCMC sampling is\(-\frac{1}{n}\mathop{\sum }\nolimits_{i = 1}^{n}{({O}_{i}-{E}_{i})}^{2}/{\sigma }_{i}^{2}\)wherenis the number of constraints,Oiare the model outputs,Eiare the constraint values andσitheir uncertainties. The large uncertainty in the continental crust40K concentration (Supplementary Table7) encompasses the range of different estimates73. The large uncertainty in the bulk mantle40Ar/36Ar ratio reflects the range of values measured in MORBs and OIBs3. Because Earth’s K concentration strongly affects the distribution of terrestrial40Ar, we do not assume any particular value forKBSEbut rather allow it to vary as a free parameter within a wide range encompassing published estimates (Extended Data Fig.
1) so that we can assess values that are required to match the K–Ar observational constraints. We also note that previous models of the K–Ar system9,10,11,12,22,23,26have not considered the possibility of atmospheric Ar subduction.
Our MCMC implementation uses the affine-invariant sampler74coded in the Python package emcee75. We sample from uniform prior distributions listed in Table1. We discard the first 25,000 MCMC samples as burn-in and use the subsequent 25,000 samples as the posterior parameter distributions to ensure that sampling has stabilized and model outputs match the observational constraints (Supplementary Figs.
1–6). The median and middle 95% of the posterior distributions (Table1) are considered the ‘best-fit’ parameter values and a measure of their uncertainties. In addition, the distributions are shown as bivariate probability density plots (Supplementary Figs.
7–12), which allows for visualization of correlations with between parameters. These plots detail the physical and chemical scenarios required to match the K–Ar observations, as discussed in the main text.
Ar–He mixing modelWe hypothesize that subducted oceanic crust delivering atmospheric Ar to the mantle can explain the distribution of mantle40Ar/36Ar ratios, including low values seen in OIBs. However, very high4He/3He ratios in subducted oceanic crust76could potentially overprint primordial (low)4He/3He ratios in OIBs. Here we describe an illustrative mixing model between subducted oceanic crust and primordial material to demonstrate that addition of subducted oceanic crust to primordial material can strongly influence40Ar/36Ar while preserving primordial4He/3He. Ar endmember compositions come from our dlnρ64 model. The primordial component has 1.18 × 1010atoms g–136Ar, and40Ar/36Ar = 36,800. The subducted oceanic crust component has 4.87 × 1010atoms g–136Ar, and40Ar/36Ar = 2,100 (averages of 1.0 ± 0.1 Gyr old eclogite tracers). We assume that the primordial component has 6.10 × 1010atoms g–13He (ref.
71) and4He/3He = 6,000 and that the subducted oceanic crust component has 2.48 × 106atoms g–13He (assuming 1 Gyr old crust with 47 ppb U and 99 ppb Th (ref.
77)) and4He/3He = 108. Adding 25% subducted oceanic crust to the primordial endmember decreases40Ar/36Ar from 36,800 to 16,700 but only increases4He/3He from 6,000 to 7,200. This mixing model is simplistic in that the endmember compositions and mixing proportions are largely hypothetical, the mixture does not consider other components such as depleted MORB mantle and atmosphere-derived Ar and radiogenic He are contained in different parts of the subducting slabs, so they may be physically separated during subduction and mantle convection. Despite these simplifications, the calculation demonstrates that subducted oceanic crust could have high enough36Ar and low enough3He concentrations to strongly affect Ar but not He isotopes.
Timescaling in the dlnρ64ts modelOur geodynamic models have constant internal heating and core–mantle boundary and surface temperatures, resulting in nearly constant convective vigour with time14. We therefore simulate the effect of early enhanced convective vigour in the dlnρ64 model by modifying the time steps such that the total model time remains 4.55 Gyr but with shorter intervals between early time steps and longer intervals between later ones. To map rescaled time\(t^{\prime}\)to original timet, we chose a hyperbolic function\(t^{\prime} =(k\ {t}_{{\mathrm{E}}}\ t+t)/(k\ t+1)\)wheretEis the age of the Earth (assumed to be 4.55 Gyr) andkis a parameter that controls the extent of rescaling. The maximum scaling we can achieve (withk= −0.1 Gyr−1) yields a model, dlnρ64ts, with plate speeds approximately doubled at the model start and decreasing roughly linearly with time (Fig.
3b). The increased Hadean–Archaean mantle processing rate in the dlnρ64ts model is still slower than that required by models of Pu–U–Xe evolution, which can be up to 7–10 times the modern processing rate53,54. The maximum rescaling possible by our methodology is limited by a requirement in our geochemical post-processing for a sufficient number of tracers to experience melting during each time step, which is not met when convective speeds become very slow towards the end of the model.

Extended dataExtended Data Fig. 1 Fraction of terrestrial40Ar in the atmosphere for different BSE K concentrations (red line).
The other colored lines assume that all40Ar produced before the specified time is lost to space, for example by impacts. Due to the long half-life of40K, the amount of40Ar produced and lost even after 200 Ma hardly affects the terrestrial40Ar budget and the missing Ar paradox. Furthermore, these calculations assume efficient degassing such that all40Ar produced within the specified time is subject to atmospheric loss. Any40Ar retained within the Earth would reduce the effect. A95 = Allègre et al.
