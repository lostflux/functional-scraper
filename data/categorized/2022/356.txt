It is also an opportunity to transfer knowledge to the operations team, test all the procedures, and get ready to start the first experiments.
$(document).ready(function(){ // Opening popup with dedicated list function openPop(width, list){ $('.inline-pop').colorbox({ iframe:true, opacity:0.8, href:"/ajax/www/popups/wd_700/lang_/urldepth_0/id_" + list, width: "65%", scrolling: false, }); } // definition popup $('a.definition').each(function() { var widthValue = $(this).data('width') + 'px'; $(this).qtip({ content: { text: function(event, api) { $.ajax({ url: api.elements.target.attr('data-source') // Use href attribute as URL }) .then(function(content) { // Set the tooltip content upon successful retrieval api.set('content.text', content); }, function(xhr, status, error) { // Upon failure... set the tooltip content to error api.set('content.text', status + ': ' + error); }); return 'Loading...'; // Set some initial text } }, position: { viewport: $(window), target: 'mouse' }, style: { classes: 'qtip-rounded qtip-wiki', // No additional classes added to .qtip element width: widthValue } }); }); })For First Plasma, the master commissioning schedule calls for systems to be brought into service in the following order: steady state electrical network (SSEN); central control system; liquid, gas and HVAC services; cooling water; cryoplant; electron cyclotron heating; vacuum pumping; fuelling; and coil power supplies.
$(document).ready(function(){ // Opening popup with dedicated list function openPop(width, list){ $('.inline-pop').colorbox({ iframe:true, opacity:0.8, href:"/ajax/www/popups/wd_700/lang_/urldepth_0/id_" + list, width: "65%", scrolling: false, }); } // definition popup $('a.definition').each(function() { var widthValue = $(this).data('width') + 'px'; $(this).qtip({ content: { text: function(event, api) { $.ajax({ url: api.elements.target.attr('data-source') // Use href attribute as URL }) .then(function(content) { // Set the tooltip content upon successful retrieval api.set('content.text', content); }, function(xhr, status, error) { // Upon failure... set the tooltip content to error api.set('content.text', status + ': ' + error); }); return 'Loading...'; // Set some initial text } }, position: { viewport: $(window), target: 'mouse' }, style: { classes: 'qtip-rounded qtip-wiki', // No additional classes added to .qtip element width: widthValue } }); }); })Once power is available, the central control system will be turned on and made ready to control, monitor and record data from each of the systems to come. The first task for the control system will be to start up the cooling water systems and the cooling towers, testing each pump and valve before initiating the circulation and flow tests.

Next in line are the nitrogen and helium production facilities in the cryogenic plant and the various auxiliary vacuum pumping systems.

When all of these systems have passed their tests, the construction phase of ITER is complete and the operations phase of the project can begin with integrated commissioning, which tests that all systems are working together.

At that point, the ITER machine will be ready for the researchers.
GalleryCommissioning the liquid nitrogen (LN2) plantAs part of LN2 plant commissioning, this liquid nitrogen tank is being filled to 80% of its capacity to verify the rate of evaporation, which should not exceed 0.16 percent of the total volume per day. The tank in the photo has a capacity of 300 cubic metres.
29 April 2022Site Services Building: beginning to serve clientsThe Site Services Building is beginning to service its first utility clients on the ITER platform. Densely packed with a demineralized water plant, chiller systems, air compressors, dozens of pumps and kilometres of piping, the facility produces and distributes compressed and breathable air (for operators in ventilated nuclear suits), demineralized water for cooling circuits and detritiation systems, and cold water for air conditioning systems.
18 March 2022Compressed air for cryoplant commissioning firstConnecting the compressed air distribution network to the cryoplant was an essential step in the testing of the facility's 1,500 pneumatic actuators and hundreds of control valves. An integrated team composed of ITER operators and European staff from Fusion for Energy and Engage have been working closely together to achieve this milestone. The demineralized water system will be next, and progressively, one by one, all the clients throughout the installation on the platform will be served.
18 March 2022From the topIn March, the commissioning team transfers water from the hot basin to two cells of the cooling tower for the first time, using vertical turbine pump #13. In the picture, we can see the water in the towers by spray nozzles to the fill packs (which increase the heat exchange surface).
09 March 2022Commissioning the heat rejection systemCommissioning of the heat rejection system is well underway, clearing the path for all "client" systems. The team started by performing loop checks, testing of input/output signals, starting up motors and pumps, and circulating water through the basins.
04 February 2022Implementing every step of the processAnother commissioning task is testing the control software for the heat rejection system. Laura de Frutos Bolzoni (centre) is the engineer responsible for integrating the cooling water system with CODAC (ITER's central control system). Thomas Pralus (left) and Thierry Menguy (right) also work in the Operations Division with responsibility for cooling water commissioning.
04 February 2022Step-by-step commissioningOne big remaining task for the team is testing the 10 cooling towers. A lot of cold commissioning has already been done there, including all the instrumentation of the cooling tower fans; the next step is to start the fans.
04 February 2022Cryoplant: first steps towards commissioningOver the past three and a half years, some 5,000 tonnes of equipment (tanks, compressors, piping, valves, truck-size electrical motors and Zeppelin-like gas bags) were installed in the cryoplant. Now, a two-year commissioning period opens.
25 November 2021Cryoplant: temporary control roomFor the next two years, cryoplant commissioning operations and equipment testing will be managed from this temporary control room. At a later stage, cryoplant operation and monitoring will be moved to the main ITER control room (which is presently under construction).
25 November 2021Pre-commissioningAs part of cryoplant pre-commissioning, operators are testing and verifying control-command systems, performing leak tests, and ensuring cleanliness, helium purity and the safety of the equipment.
25 November 2021Attention to detailEnsuring the cleanliness of the equipment inside the installation is an integral part of the pre-commissioning process. Here, workers are busy dusting and cleaning pipes between one of the cryoplant's 18 screw compressors (foreground) and the 1 MW electrical motor that drives it.
25 November 2021Cooling plant: next step, commissioningApproximately 6,000 tonnes of equipment for the ITER cooling plant have been supplied by India and installed by ITER Organization contractors. The next step is plant commissioning.
15 October 2021Preserving installed componentsBetween installation and operation, machine components and plant equipment must be kept in good condition through preservation activities. Here, a worker performs a white cloth test to check for moisture on a cryostat support bearing during a preservation inspection.
01 September 2021Integrated commissioning at ITERITER's approach to commissioning makes a clear distinction between system commissioning and integrated commissioning. This chart shows the highest-level tasks for Integrated Commissioning 1, which concludes with First Plasma.

Site acceptance tests of all system equipment on arrival from China ensures a no-default situation despite the long journey and subsequent handling.
08 April 2021Point of departureCryolines originating in the cryoplant deliver cooling fluids to some essential elements of the ITER machine—the superconducting magnets, the cryopumps and the different parts of the thermal shield.
23 March 2021Into the depthsFor five days in late November, a diver explored the depths of the heat rejection basins, inspecting the critical zones of the massive concrete structure that had been "overfilled" for structural testing.
27 November 2020Testing the basinsPrior to turning over the heat rejection system to the ITER commissioning team, a leak tightness test was organized for the system's cold and hot basins. The basins were filled to capacity, and even a little beyond, to test their leak tightness and structural solidity.
14 October 2020Takes a teamAssessing the leak tightness of the heat rejection system basins involved the ITER Control Division, in charge of instrumentation and control; the Operations Division; the Mechanical Implementation Division; the Field Engineering Installation Division, and Site Coordination.
14 October 2020Secondary cooling circuitThe chiller plant in the Site Services Building has been turned over to the ITER Science, Controls & Operation Department (SCOD) for commissioning. Now, a commissioning team led by SCOD will start to energize the equipment, fill the pipes, and test the circuits and control interfaces of this auxiliary plant, which is one element of the chilled water system.
21 September 2020Central interlockThe ITER central interlock system will interface with 170 local interlock systems (at the level of each plant system) to ensure machine protection. Material is beginning to arrive on site.
08 June 2020Verifying everythingChecking the protection logic for the high voltage relays during the commissioning of ITER's electrical distribution system.
07 February 2020Early control roomBecause the main ITER control room will not be in place until 2022, a temporary control room had to be put into place. The temporary control room is really a "virtual control room" in the sense that it is several different rooms connected together.
07 February 2020"Energization" begins for second electrical distribution networkThe first of three transformers for the pulsed power electrical network (PPEN) was successfully "energized" on 26 November. Procured by China and installed by Europe, weighing close to 500 tonnes and towering 15 metres above ground, the PPEN transformers are the largest electrical components of the project.
26 November 2019ITER's first electrical distribution system enters operationAfter several months of tests and commissioning, the first ITER system—steady state electrical distribution—enters into operation on 23 January 2019. The ITER site is now independently powered by an electrical substation that draws power directly from the 400 kV French national grid.
23 January 2019Commissioning local control systemsOne after another, 170 local controls systems have to be integrated into central conventional control, CODAC. In this image, members of the Controls Division are attempting for the first time to operate high voltage circuit breakers from the CODAC human/machine interface.
07 January 2019An unassuming name, a strategic buildingDespite a rather unassuming name, the Site Services Building is a strategic resource for the entire installation, accommodating and distributing a large number of industrial support services and systems. All mechanical and electrical equipment (pumps, chillers, pressurizers, cabinets and chemical dosing systems) and relevant piping has been installed, and a series of hydrostatic tests have been completed successfully.
12 December 2018First transformer is powered up''Electricians'' and command-control specialists from the ITER Organization and the European Domestic Agency (Fusion for Energy) succeed on 18 September in powering up the four transformers of the steady state electrical network.
18 September 2018When a transformer purrsA test energization procedure is carried out on the first of four 22 kV steady state electrical network (SSEN) transformers, which have not managed power since factory acceptance tests in 2014. By "revving them up," the team is verifying that all is well.
30 March 2017Working toward energizing the switchyardIn close coordination with the French transmission system operator RTE the ITER Organization is now embarked on the step-by-step process that will lead to the "energization" of the ITER switchyard. Tests started in January 2017 on the first of the switchyard's seven bays.
20 January 20174.8 km of cryolines pass leak testAfter more than a full year of work, all 4.8 kilometres of cryolines and "warm lines" installed inside the cryoplant have been successfully leak-tested by the INOXCVA team operating under the responsibility of ITER India.
