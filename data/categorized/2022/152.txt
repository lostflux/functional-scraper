Our Star Trek-like Future Awaits on This Week’s Episode of Ask an Expert [VIDEO]If you consider how much of our world’s systems revolve around scarcity — from basic needs like food and shelter to quality-of-life improving desirables — it’s no wonder that the resource-abundant world of theStar Trekuniverse would seem like utopian fantasy. But every day, advances in science and technology take a step closer to a future that in a word can be described as abundant.
In the season finale ofAsk an Expert,Peter Diamandis discusses a future of abundancealong with asteroid mining robots and how technology affects his daily life. Diamandis is the Chairman and CEO of the X PRIZE Foundation, which launches incentive prizes to drive technological breakthroughs for humanity’s benefit. He is also the co-Founder and Executive Chairman of Singularity University.
