Although the two assembly contractors for the Tokamak Complex work in distinct areas, their work scope contains many common elements.
$(document).ready(function(){ // Opening popup with dedicated list function openPop(width, list){ $('.inline-pop').colorbox({ iframe:true, opacity:0.8, href:"/ajax/www/popups/wd_700/lang_/urldepth_0/id_" + list, width: "65%", scrolling: false, }); } // definition popup $('a.definition').each(function() { var widthValue = $(this).data('width') + 'px'; $(this).qtip({ content: { text: function(event, api) { $.ajax({ url: api.elements.target.attr('data-source') // Use href attribute as URL }) .then(function(content) { // Set the tooltip content upon successful retrieval api.set('content.text', content); }, function(xhr, status, error) { // Upon failure... set the tooltip content to error api.set('content.text', status + ': ' + error); }); return 'Loading...'; // Set some initial text } }, position: { viewport: $(window), target: 'mouse' }, style: { classes: 'qtip-rounded qtip-wiki', // No additional classes added to .qtip element width: widthValue } }); }); })Mechanical and piping works:vessels, piping systems, heat exchangers, pumps, motors; cable trays and cable pulling; wave guides; piping thermal installation; pressure tests, flushing.
Electrical, instrumentation and control:DC busbars, switching equipment, power cables, I&C cables and cabinets.

Also challenging are the installation tolerances, the large number of components and the tight schedule.

With a core team of about 80 people chosen from the ITER Organization, the European Domestic Agency buildings team, contractors, suppliers, and the Domestic Agencies, the HIT works in a step-by-step way to assess all available system design elements for completeness, consistency and constructability.
GalleryDiagnostics: installing captive components nowSupport elements for diagnostic pipes, cables and lines are received at the workshop of the installation contractor on the ITER site, before they are assembled and installed in the Tokamak Complex. Any captive components (soon to be boxed in by other systems or components) must be installed now.
31 March 2022Early installation for optical diagnosticsRecently installed diagnostics supports at the L1 level of the Tokamak Building, showing some of the detail of how the supports are bolted to the ceiling by first welding threaded studs to steel plates embedded in the ceiling concrete. This allows for high accuracy in the installation of the optical beamlines.
31 March 2022"Hugging" the ceilingSupports installed on the ceiling in the B1 level of the Tokamak Building, showing the ''ceiling hugging'' nature, which keeps the diagnostic systems very close to the ceiling and above other installed equipment.
31 March 2022Keeping track of all partsThis small part, an elbow joint, must be manufactured, inspected, transported, received in an ITER warehouse, inspected again, logged into the system and finally stored before the time comes for it to be integrated into the ITER machine. ITER's Integrated Material & Logistics Management Group is currently managing the storage of 1.5 million parts and components. (See more at: https://www.iter.org/newsline/-/3725)03 February 2022ITER's largest warehouseThe main ITER warehouse on site, where components are stored according to specific requirements such as temperature and humidity control. On average, four or five shipments arrive at the main warehouse each day.
03 February 2022Tanks galoreTanks line the exterior of the building. From left to right: one of two quench tanks; a 200,000-litre helium storage tank; atmospheric vaporizers; one out of two 80 K cold boxes (for the cooling of the cryostat shielding system); a vertical liquid nitrogen storage tank; and seven vertical tanks for nitrogen and helium storage.
25 November 20215,000 tonnes of equipmentAs tall as a seven-storey building and covering the equivalent of two soccer fields, the ITER cryoplant is located south of the Tokamak Complex. The largest single-unit cryogenic installation in the world, it is tasked with a daunting mission: to provide cooling fluids to 10,000 tonnes of superconducting magnets, eight massive cryopumps, and thousands of square metres of thermal shielding. Approximately 5,000 tonnes of equipment have been installed and commissioning is about to start.
25 November 2021Cryoplant, from aboveDespite being water cooled, the large power machines inside the cryoplant will dissipate considerable amounts of heat (on the order of 20 MW). HVAC ducts on the building's roof are tasked with extracting it. The yellow elements at the top of this drone photograph are busbars feeding electrical power to the installation.
25 November 2021I&CThe "E-house" is where signals from the cooling water plant are tied into the overall network of instrumentation and control for ITER, which is monitored from the ITER control room.
15 October 2021InsulationTeams are completing the insulation of the pipes connecting 17 heat exchangers to the cooling water plant.
15 October 2021Different loopsCooling water circulates in the ITER installation in three separate loops: the tokamak loop, the auxiliary plant loop, and the balance of site. (Pictured in this photo is the loop #1 pumping station.)15 October 2021First client: the cryoplantThe ITER cryoplant will be one of the first "clients" to require cooling water, which is why the cooling plant team has started commissioning that part of the plant first. Pictured, is the pumping station that will service the cryoplant.
15 October 2021Cooling plant responsibilitiesThe Indian Domestic Agency is responsible for the design and fabrication of the heat rejection system. The ITER Organization is responsible for equipment installation and system commissioning.
15 October 2021Large valvesValves like these control the flow of cooling water through the heat exchangers.
15 October 2021Chemistry mattersThe chemical injection system adds chemicals to the pipes and cooling towers to prevent scaling, bacteria and legionella from growing.
15 October 2021Maximum flowAt peak flow (during a plasma pulse) the cooling plant is designed to handle 7,700 cubic metres of water per second.
15 October 2021Cooling plant: nearly fully installedEquipment procured by India has been installed in the 6,000 m² cooling tower area on the northern corner of the ITER site, including heat exchangers (photo), chemical treatment equipment, pumps, piping and cooling towers.

25 September 2021Just tall enoughThis L3 gallery is just tall enough to permit the handling, by telescopic spider crane, of the 1.5-tonne, 11-metre-long spool. On 16 June it is inserted into the narrow ''south shaft'' connecting L3 to B2, which is designed to host this cryoline plus one other.
16 June 2021Vertical"Vertical cryolines" will connect the cryoline network in the basement (B2 level) with those on level L3. A first vertical spool is installed in the south shaft at L3 on 16 June.
16 June 2021Building the feeders, segment by segmentThis cryostat feedthrough is one of two feeder components introduced into the basement of the Tokamak Complex on 14 April. Called the STR3 feedthrough, it will supply supercritical helium at 4.5 K to the toroidal field coil cases and other coil structures (central solenoid, correction coils).
14 April 2021Just large enoughThis opening in the Tritium Building is just large enough for feeder elements to pass. This one (the coil termination box for poloidal coil #4 ) is 17 metres long.
14 April 2021Down the alleyA large cryoline spool, with several process pipes inside its metal case, is transported along the cryoplant to be installed through the roof of the far end, near the Tokamak Building.
25 March 2021Delivers heliumThe largest of the two spools installed on Thursday 25 March was 12 metres long, 1 metre in diameter and weighed 6 tonnes. It is tasked with delivering supercritical helium at 4.7 K (minus 269 °C) to the magnets.
25 March 2021CarefullyThe cryoline spools are delicate pieces of high technology that can only tolerate a certain level of acceleration during transport and lift. Shock recorders allowed operators to control every step of the process.
25 March 2021Through the roofA massive steel structure supports the 6-tonne component that has come through the roof. It needs to be precisely aligned with the connections on top of the cryoplant's termination cold box.
25 March 2021Dark grey elementsThe two elements in dark grey have now been installed. At the bottom, they connect to the cryoplant's termination cold box (which acts as a dispenser of cooling fluids). At the top, other spools will connect to carry the cooling fluids across a bridge to the Tokamak Building.
25 March 2021Yellow thruwaysDC busbars in the Magnet Power Conversion buildings start at the AC/DC converters and run all the way through the buildings, over a bridge, and through the Tokamak Complex to the superconducting magnets.

This team from the Italian-Slovakian contractor Busbar4F is carrying out the work.
04 February 20218 metres tallIn this high-ceilinged space called "the cathedral," cable trays are installed nearly 8 metres high. From here, cables head in all directions, eventually reaching the four corners of the platform.
04 February 2021A creature?More than 4.5 kilometres of cable galleries run underneath the ITER platform. In certain places, where the cables bend towards the surface, the impression is that of tentacles belonging to a creature lurking in the depths.
04 February 2021As thick as an armSeven centimetres in diameter, the 66 kV cables transport 300 times the voltage of a standard household cord.

The example in this photo illustrates how the penetrations must be backfilled with concrete, while providing passageway for in/out cooling water pipes.
17 December 2020AnticipationThe yellow busbars that cross the Diagnostics Building to provide power to the superconducting magnets cannot be re-routed. All other systems must be designed around this constraint and installed on supports welded to embedded plates on the walls and the ceiling.
17 December 2020Yellow busbarsIn the lowest basement level of the Diagnostics Building (B2), a labyrinth of busbars is being installed. Some five kilometres of these specialized power transfer devices will be needed to connect the magnets to the source of their power several hundred metres away.
10 December 2020Good progressn one of the twin Magnet Power Conversion buildings (B33), 100% of supports, busbars, links, and plates have been installed, together with cooling water hoses and junction boxes.
09 December 2020ConnectingHere are the connection boxes between busbar lengths in the Magnet Power Conversion buildings.
08 December 2020The cryoplant's "cryogenic termination cold box"ITER technical responsible officer Hyun Sik Chang (right) and a technician from the Swiss company Linde Kryotechnik AG, perform the cleanliness check protocol on the multiprocess cryolines of the cryogenic termination cold box. This box collects the cooling fluids from the cryoplant and redirects them to the Tokamak Building over an elevated bridge.
12 November 2020Connecting busbarsPart of the work to install several kilometres of busbars between the Magnet Power Conversion facilities and the ITER magnets, is the interconnection that joins two busbar lengths.
09 November 2020Progressing wellBusbars leave the Magnet Power Conversion buildings by overhead pass and cross through the Diagnostics Building to reach the magnets. Some 89% of busbar supports and 76% of planned busbars in the Diagnostics Building have been installed by assembly contractors.
09 November 2020Piping interconnectionsIn the Cryoplant Building, a welder complete the first cryoline piping interconnection on the liquid helium plant cold box.
03 November 2020A novel technique for a novel environmentITER is working with "augmented reality" to plan for, and visualize, complex installation and maintenance tasks in crowded environments. The novel technique is the fruit of a collaboration between the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) and the ITER Organization. (Read more at: https://www.iter.org/newsline/-/3509.)26 October 2020Night shiftOne of the challenges of the plant assembly project is coordinating the different actors with activities in the same areas. At this coordination meeting, we can identify some of the participants by the colour of the hardhats—green for safety agents, red for foremen/women and supervisors, and white for workers.
15 October 2020Testing the basinsThe heat rejection system team begins a week-long "fill test" for the cold and hot basis of the cooling tower area. From this temporary control room, the level of the water can be monitored.
14 October 2020FullAfter one week the heat rejection basins were full and detailed investigations could begin.
14 October 2020Inside and outThe equipment inside and outside of the conversion buildings is dedicated to the ITER superconducting magnets, which require power at DC voltages between 0.10 kV and 1.35 kV, depending on their size. © Les Nouveaux Médias/SNC ENGAGE09 October 2020Measuring the currentArranged in three sets, there are 39 of these "current transformers" in the one-hectare Reactive Power Compensators Area (A39). Despite their name, they can be described as sensors that monitor the variations of the current.
05 October 2020Thyristor alleyNine thyristors (3 metres tall and weighing over 2 tonnes each) are hosted inside the Reactive Power Control Building on the ITER site. Thyristors are power electronic devices that act like switches. ITER Organization contractors Consortium Fincantieri SI and SAET have now finalized 80% of the installation.
04 October 2020TowersThese 8-metre-tall tower-like structures are thyristor-controlled reactors. Directly connected to the thyristors inside the Reactive Power Control Building to the right, their function is to smooth the sine wave of the AC current, filtering out distortions.
04 October 2020A new feeder elementA feeder element newly arrived from China is stored on site prior to installation. (Magnet feeders carry electricity and cryogens to the superconducting magnets.)01 October 2020Connecting busbarsNear the ceiling of a Tokamak Building gallery, contractors have connected two busbar lengths.
26 September 2020A welding bubbleThis worker is welding a steel pipe to its concrete passageway. One of the machine's magnet feeders will pass through this tunnel on its way to supply magnets with power and liquid helium.
24 September 2020Forklifts and pulleysMoving and adjusting the beams into position is a delicate operation that requires the coordinated movements of forklifts and pulley systems before they can be manually bolted to their supports.
10 September 2020Precision workOnce bolted to their supports, the busbar lengths must be connected to one another and to cooling water collectors. Hose connections must be installed before the whole system can be tested and commissioned.
10 September 2020Weighty componentsIndividual busbar segments are sometimes very long (up to 12 metres) and quite heavy, ranging from 2 to 4 tonnes in weight.
10 September 2020OverheadIn the Diagnostics Building, teams are bolting the busbars to supports anchored in the ceiling. The environment is already crowded with cable trays and all sorts of piping and HVAC ducts.
10 September 2020"Power cords" thicker than train railsOriginating in the Magnet Power Conversion buildings (as seen here), busbars will travel over bridges to the Tokamak Complex to deliver power to the superconducting magnets. These train-rail-sized bars can carry current 7,000 times more intense than a heavy-duty electrical cable.
09 September 2020All about busbarsThe interior of the Magnet Power Conversion buildings resembles a busbar forest. Busbar lengths are now being installed in the Tokamak Complex; in the year ahead, a bridge between the two buildings will be realized and the different lengths connected.
04 September 2020First busbars in Tokamak ComplexThe first magnet busbars are being installed among cable trays and other equipment on the ceiling of this Tokamak Complex gallery. Each length weighs between 2 and 4 tonnes.
03 September 2020Room for manoeuvreMoving a busbar into place in the Diagnostics Building. Equipment installation is underway in the higher areas first (the ceiling) in carefully coordinated sequences so that each piece fits without having to alter what is already installed.
03 September 2020Converter arrives from KoreaIn one of the Magnet Power Conversion buildings, a converter bridge has arrived from Korea. The converter changes the power from AC to DC before being supplied to the central solenoid.
02 September 2020On the roof of the cooling tower buildingVibration testing is underway on the cooling towers.
24 August 2020Contractors-in-trainingContractors charged with the installation of DC busbars, switching networks and fast discharge units (Balance of Plant Group 5) have spent the last months training for the work they will carry out on site. Here, members of the team lift a high voltage insulator onto a cable termination.
12 August 2020One of the last giantsOne of the last large components enters the ITER cryoplant: a 56-tonne helium dryer.
02 June 2020As dry as 'He' can getCold boxes do not like water. Before it is processed, gaseous helium needs to be perfectly dry to prevent damage. This crucial operation is the task of a 56-tonne ''helium dryer'' that was installed in the cryoplant on 27 May.
27 May 2020Welding equipment supportsIn the vast galleries of the Tokamak Complex on every level, ten of thousands of steel plates have been embedded into the floors, ceilings and walls. Now we see why: all equipment, like these cable tray supports, has to be welded to these plates to avoid drilling into the concrete (which is forbidden in a nuclear building). © Les Nouveaux Médias/SNC ENGAGE15 May 2020Deep in the Tokamak ComplexWelding the pipes inside the multi-process cryolines is a challenging operation, sometimes performed in an extremely cramped environment.
13 May 2020500 sections of cryolines to connectPrior to welding cryoline sections, process pipes that transport the cooling fluid need to be cut and surfaced for optimal adjustment.
13 May 2020Next step: large fansAt the top of the building each cooling cell is topped by a "fan cylinder." Once installed, the twelve-blade fans will induce an upward draft.
22 January 2020Fill packsInside each cooling cell, stacked layers of millimetre-thick corrugated plastic sheet (''fill pack'') act like the honeycomb structure of a car radiator. (Look closely at the black ''floor.'')22 January 202010t of water per secondThirteen large vertical turbine pumps (in blue), each one powered by a 870 kW motor and capable of moving 10 tonnes of water per second, circulate water throughout the heat rejection system.
22 January 202065,000 ampsHigh-intensity current (65,000 amps) is fed to the toroidal field coils through a double set of busbars (right). The simple set of busbars to the left is for a poloidal field coil that requires "only" 55,000 amps. Just like in daily life, DC outlet busbars have a positive and a negative polarity.
16 January 2020Utmost precisionIn the densely packed environment of the buildings, laser measurement ensures that each component—whether busbar, converter or reactor—is set into place with utmost precision.
16 January 2020Inside and outThe first of a set of four converter modules for poloidal field coil #6 has just been installed. Connected to an outdoor transformer by way of three AC busbars, the converters are tasked with converting the 1 kV power from AC to DC. There are 12 such converters in one of the buildings, 17 in the other. The converters serving the poloidal field coils are procured by China; all others are procured by Korea.
16 January 2020Smoothing the currantThis strange contraption that looks like a giant vintage seismograph is a "reactor." Its function is to create a magnetic field that filters the small spikes in DC waveform before it is fed to the magnetic system. Korea and China are sharing procurement of the 31 reactors, each coupled with a converter or set of converters, that the system requires.
16 January 2020Fresh from RussiaWorkers unpack a section of DC busbar that has just been delivered from Russia. The contorted shape reflects the complexity of connections in some areas of the buildings. This section is a vertical interface for a correction coil converter.
