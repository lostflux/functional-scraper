"fake-h3">Key information"fake-h3">Applications are now closedOverviewOur MSc in Applied Biosciences and Biotechnology provides an in-depth understanding of the core principles and methodologies underlying modern bioscience research and trains students in laboratory and research skills.
The course includes both taught and research-based projects encompassing biochemistry, molecular cell biology, systems and synthetic biology, bioinformatics, and entrepreneurship.
This is designed to equip you with the knowledge and practical skills to plan, conduct and evaluate a programme of original research, use laboratory equipment to generate data and understand and evaluate current research.
Study programmeThis full-time programme lasts for one academic year and is made up of both taught and research-based elements.
The taught elements begin in October and last for the duration of the autumn and spring terms and comprises lectures, seminars, tutorials and laboratory and computer classes.
The first of the research-based elements also begin in the spring term and you complete your tutored dissertation over four weeks. You then start work on your laboratory-based research project for the remainder of the year during the Summer term which is often consistent with your interests and with career aspirations.
CareersYou gain the relevant skills and knowledge needed to pursue careers in the rapidly growing biosciences and biotechnology sectors. Previous graduates have gone on to work in industrial and public sections, both in the UK and overseas.
