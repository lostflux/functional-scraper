Understanding the biology of aging and longevityWe seek to answer the most challenging biological questions of our time — how humans age and can we develop interventions to allow people to live longer, healthier lives.
ApproachSince our founding, Calico’s approach to understanding the biology of aging and age-related diseases has remained the foundation of our effortsFocusing on both basic research and the translation of our discoveries into new interventions that can help people live healthier, and maybe longer, livesTaking a long-term approach, understanding that breakthroughs are made possible through persistent efforts over timeThe convergence of biology and technology, coupled with a long-term perspective and fundingEmploying an interdisciplinary approach, harnessing advanced technologies and computing, to accelerate discoveries. Inventing new methods when existing technology and approaches do not meet our needsCollaborating with external organizations, including other biopharmaceutical companies and academic institutions, to buoy our effortsUnderstanding how yeast ageCalico scientists in our yeast biology labs, along with the computing and technology groups, are collaborating closely on a long-term project to invent new technology and processes to understand the biology of aging at the cellular level by studying yeast. Understanding how yeast age at the cellular level may provide important insight into how higher-level organisms age. Prior to refining...
Basic researchWe hire scientists with a broad range of skills and experiences and encourage them to collaborate freelyOur Basic Research group featuresPrincipal Investigator-led labsworking to understand the biological pathways of aging and disease — efforts that are accelerated by advanced computing and technology that are at or beyond the state-of-the art.
Small labs, big collaborationOur research efforts are designed to fuel intellectual freedom and creativity. Ours is a bottom-up approach. Labs at Calico are small and we encourage collaboration and interdisciplinary research at every turn.
Biology that mattersScientists in our basic research labs are working to understand how experimental organisms age by observing the aging process at the whole organism, organ/tissue and cellular level. Through these research efforts, Calico scientists work to understand the biological underpinnings of aging by studying organisms such as yeast,C. elegans(worms), mice and naked mole-rats. And our researchers, especially our computational biologists, are digging deep into large available human genetic data sets to inform our efforts.
TechnologyOur research is powered by technologyWe like to think of it as beyond state-of-the-art. At Calico, our technology labs work hand-in-hand with scientists throughout the company, advancing hypotheses on how specific technologies and know-how can help answer a research question at the depth required to advance the field.
If existing technology does not help us answer a research question, then we’ll invent something new. Scientists and engineers in our technology labs are not bound by the questions of others. Our labs seek out their own experiments and big questions and are encouraged to build and harness new technologies and tools that can support the entire scientific community.

Our Computing team works closely with our R&D colleagues to understand which data that we create may generate the most impactful hypotheses, design experiments to test these hypotheses, and to interpret, learn and generate more hypotheses that help us understand aging better.
We use advanced computing to answer meaningful biological questions. We aim to accelerate scientific discovery by collaborating closely with our colleagues to build infrastructure, develop software, advance technology and invent new methods and algorithms.
Freedom to explore, technology to lead the wayOur team of machine learning experts, software engineers and data scientists bring quantitative rigor to the study of aging and age-related disease. We’re interpreting large sets of genotype and phenotype data from model organisms and humans to identify new insights into how we age; we’re using machine learning and advanced computer vision to analyze images generated by our various research labs; and we’re using computing to measure genomic, metabolic and physiological traits to observe and better understand the changes that occur as an organism ages — just to name a few of our ongoing efforts.

"Working on naturally evolved systems, like human biology, offers more complexity than any other system that computer scientists can work on. Our team thrives on the challenge and potential to answer big questions about how organisms age."Head of Discovery TechnologiesPartnering with CalicoWhy collaborate with CalicoWe are different by design. Calico combines the focus and drive of a start-up with the resources and world class R&D capabilities of the leading biotechnology companies. Partnering with Calico, therefore, provides a different type of collaboration ⁠— a mindset focused on tackling big, complex scientific questions, scientists who enjoy the opportunity to explore new avenues of research, and a culture that supports collaborative efforts.
