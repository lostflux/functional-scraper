Coccolithophores are a type of microscopic marine phytoplankton, and their hard calcareous plates, called coccoliths (~5 micrometers long), are normally abundant in the fossil record. Here they have dissolved from these ancient rocks deposited during a global warming interval, leaving only their imprint “ghosts” behind. See pages795and853.

Basement membranes exist across the animal kingdom but are yet to be fully understood. Using bioinformatic and in vivo approaches,Jayadevet al.
defined a network of 222 human proteins, and the related genes in other species, that constitute basement membranes. By screening more than 63,000 genomes from families with rare disorders, the authors identified genes that regulate basement membrane composition and function. This framework could lead to earlier detection, more accurate prognosis, and new therapies for basement membrane-related disease.

This month’s cover shows an immunofluorescence image of a germinal center in a mouse lymph node 5 weeks after a priming immunization with influenza hemagglutinin. Primed B cells fate-mapped for AID expression (green) are present in the central area of a follicle of IgD-expressing B cells (red) near CD21/35-expressing follicular dendritic cells (blue).

Robots have been successfully deployed in a wide range of domains–including land, sea, air, and space–for a variety of applications such as search and rescue, oceanography, wildlife surveys, and space exploration. In this issue,Zhouet al.
have developed a trajectory planner for swarms of micro drones that can be implemented using only an onboard computer. Their planner computes trajectories based on limited information from the drone's onboard sensors to enable collision-free flight in cluttered environments in the wild. This month's cover is a photo illustration of a swarm of micro-drones flying through a forest (see also the Focus bySoria).

In this image, a red Duroc pig naps in the sunlight.
Chenet al.
used the red Duroc pig as a clinically relevant model to study the healing of split-thickness skin grafts (STSGs). Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed up-regulation of mechanotransduction signaling pathways during graft healing. To disrupt these pathways, the authors applied a hydrogel containing a focal adhesion kinase inhibitor (FAKI) to the STSGs. They found that FAKI treatment improved wound healing with anti-inflammatory effects at early time points and pro-regenerative effects at later time points, suggesting that FAKI might be beneficial for the treatment of deep injuries that require STSGs.
