Apple still sells theiPhone 12andiPhone 12 Miniat lower prices, and you can find thePro modelsat various retailers for a discount. If you don't need the latest and greatest, spending as little as you can on a smartphone is financially smart. It's also smart to use a case to protect your fragile smartphone. I've tested more than 50 cases and accessories, from wireless chargers to wallets, to kit out your phone—ones that are MagSafe compatible and ones that aren't. These are our favorites.

You might remember the term from the magnetic charging cable on MacBooks of old. Apple has revived the name as a system of magnetic accessories. You can slap items like awalletorwireless chargeron the back of all the iPhone 12 and iPhone 13 models. Apple says its magnet accessories are shielded, so it's safe to use with credit cards (if maybe not hotel key cards).
There are tons of MagSafe accessories now available. An easy way to tell a MagSafe case apart from a regular case is to look for a ring of magnets on the inside of it in product images. Brands will also usually indicate whether a case is MagSafe in the product name or description.
If a case or accessory supports MagSafe in this guide, you'll see “Includes MagSafe" at the bottom. Some companies also claim MagSafe compatibility even if their cases don't have magnets. That's because the cases may be thin enough to support other magnetic accessories, but the magnetic connection may be weaker than you'd want. If you buy a case or accessory from another manufacturer, check their website for similar language.
The Official MagSafe CaseApple's standard silicone case is its best ever. The bottom edge of the phone is fully covered, with tiny cutouts for the charging port and speakers, and the whole thing feels wonderfully soft. The inner microfiber lining ensures that the back of your phone never gets a scratch. Additionally, the edges on the front are raised to offer some protection to the screen if it falls face down. The buttons are easy to press too.
This is a MagSafe case, so there's a ring of magnets in the center that securely attaches to other MagSafe accessories, like Apple'swireless MagSafe ChargerandWallet.
Includes MagSafeA MagSafe GripThese phone grips don't require any adhesives. Just pop ’em magnetically to the back of your iPhone or MagSafe case for more security. That said, these magnets are only so strong. Don't hold the phone by the grip alone, as a little effort can separate the magnets.
PopSockets PopGrip for $30:Magnetically snapthe elongated ovalto the back of your iPhone and push out the grip—voilà, you have an effortless way of holding onto your phone. As on any other PopSocket, you can swap out the top for another style, and it can even act as a kickstand to keep your iPhone propped up in landscape mode. Alternatively, I really likePopSockets' PopCase ($60), which comes with an integrated grip you can slide offandMagSafe support.
STM Goods MagLoop for $30:This one is a bit more versatile—there's not only a silicone finger loop but also a plastic loop that lets you prop the iPhone in landscape or portrait orientation. There's even a built-in bottle opener so you'll always be ready when the party starts. The magnetic connection doesn't feel as strong as the PopGrip, so really make sure to hold the iPhone and utilize the loop for maximum security.
Includes MagSafeA Screen ProtectorIt's very easy to install Nomad's screen protector. Clean the iPhone screen with the included wet wipe, dry it with the microfiber cloth, and use the stickers to remove any lingering dust. Then place the alignment tool over your iPhone, remove the backing from the tempered glass protector, and plop it in place! I had a perfect alignment in seconds. Just make sure to press down from the middle and push out to eliminate as many air bubbles as possible.
The Thinnest Case AroundIf you despise cases but know you need one, try Totallee. In no way should you expect its cases to protect your phone from a 6-foot drop—they're so thin, it barely feels like anything's there—but they'll eliminate everyday scuff marks. You can choose between matte or transparent. The former is made of flexible plastic and is the thinnest version, and the latter is constructed out of thermoplastic polyurethane, so it will fare slightly better when dropped. There's no branding anywhere, which is a nice change of pace.
The sheer thinness of these cases means they work well with both the MagSafe Charger and Wallet.
A Sustainable CaseLifeproof's Wake is made from more than 85 percent ocean-based recycled plastic. It's the way to go if sustainability is a priority for you. The edges are tough and rounded, so if you don't like the flat-edge design on the new iPhones, this will help. The buttons are very clicky (I like the colored accents), and the mute switch is easily accessible. The back has a wavy pattern that looks nice, and it keeps Apple's MagSafe Charger attached (but not the MagSafe Wallet). With every purchase, Lifeproof donates a dollar to a water-conscious nonprofit of your choosing.
★ Another eco-friendly option: There are downsides to4Ocean's sustainable case ($34). It's available only for the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro, it doesn't work with MagSafe, and I'm not a fan of the ocean pattern on the back (to me it just looks like smudges). But it has two separate shells that offer admirable protection. More important, it's made almost entirely of plastic recovered from the ocean.
A Good Cheap CaseThis case from Spigen is simple, but it includes magnets, so it works with official MagSafe accessories like Apple's Charger and Wallet. You get good protection for very little money. It's made of thermoplastic polyurethane, with a texture on the back that feels nice to the touch. The buttons are clicky, it has a slim profile, and the bumper is sturdy. If you want a clear version to show off your iPhone's color, I likeSpigen's Ultra Hybrid Mag cases.
If you don't care for the magnets, try Spigen'sLiquid Air cases, which don't support MagSafe but are otherwise almost exactly the same.
Includes MagSafeA Great Case From a Black-Owned BusinessPivet is a Black-owned business, which is a rarity in the tech space. I tested and like its Aspect Clear case, but it's also available in a few colors. The buttons are a little stiff, but the company says it's updating the case to fix this. It doesn't work too well with MagSafe gear, but the bumper is sturdy, and it's well-built. It's recyclable, but if that option isn't available, it's made of nontoxic plastic the company claims will biodegrade in landfills or the ocean. We have a deeper dive into the company's claims thatyou can read here.
A Wood CaseI love the paradox of wood wrapped around a highly engineered machine. This case from Oakywood feels more expensive than the price suggests. The real walnut wood back is hand polished, smooth, and lovely to look at, and it sits around a polycarbonate shell for shock resistance. (You can also get it in cherry wood.) It's slim, has a sturdy bumper, and the buttons are clicky. The company says it chooses its materials from sustainable sources. The downside? The front edges don't stick out much, so you likely won't see much screen protection.
This is the MagSafe version. If you don't care for the magnets, you can opt for theregular wood case, which is a little cheaper.
Includes MagSafeA PopSocket CaseIf you want your PopSocket attached to a case, go with this combo from Otterbox. There are a wide variety of designs, and if you ever get bored with a look, you can swap out the PopTop whenever you want. It won't work with any MagSafe accessories, but you can still wirelessly recharge the phone. The charging speed is very slow though, so make sure to remove the PopTop for best results.
A Recycled AlternativeThis is another great clear option to show off the iPhone 12's colors. It doesn't add much heft, and it has raised edges on the front and a scratch-resistant coating on the back. Best of all, it's made from old CDs and DVDs! The packaging is plastic-free and recyclable too. You'll get a free shipping label with your purchase to ship your old CDs to Nimble for15 percent off your next order. Nimble says the case is certified for 6-foot drops and has "permanent antimicrobial protection" to block bacteria that cause stains and odors. (It will not protect you from viruses likeCovid-19.)Apple's MagSafe wireless charger stays on the back of this case (though it can be dislodged fairly easily). The MagSafe Wallet falls off easily, too.
For Ultimate ProtectionI hate ultra-thick cases, especially ones that need to be taken apart just to insert the phone. But if you need the most protection possible, theDefender Pro from OtterBoxwill do the trick. To use it, you need to remove the rubber slipcover, peel apart the polycarbonate shell, and layer the two pieces at the top and bottom of your iPhone. Then snap them shut, wrangle the slipcover back over, and you're done (whew).
If you frequently take your iPhone out of its case, this will be a pain. But it protects the charging port and mute switch, and it's so thick I have a hard time seeing it fail to protect your device. Just know that there's no cover for the screen with this version, but the front has raised lips, and you do get a holster to clip it to your belt. The case also renders MagSafe completely useless, but wireless charging still works!The Prettiest CasesIf you want to inject a bit of personality into your case, there's no better place to go than Sonix. It has a variety of styles, from glow-in-the-dark to colorful and reflective designs. Better yet, there's MagSafe support. (Sonix also hasnon-MagSafe versions.) They have a tough bumper, clicky buttons, and raised edges. The plastic they're made out of is also infused with an antimicrobial agent to keep certain types of bacteria at bay.
Sonix also has a niftyMagSafe adjustable stand ($50)that lets you elevate your phone on your desk or nightstand. The phone stays secure via magnets, though the base could be heavier and grippier, as it can slide around. You can attachApple's MagSafe chargerorSonix's very ownto the back to turn it into a charging dock.
Includes MagSafe★ A fashionable case: I think Sonix's cases look nicer, butIncipio's Kate Spade collaboration ($50)is worth looking at, especially if you're a fan of the brand. It supports MagSafe, has raised lips, and the whole thing is quite grippy.
A Cork CaseI love this cork case from Swedish company 15:21. Cork has a pleasant texture and has some grip to it, yet it's thin and lightweight. The edges on the front aren't raised, and this thing is skimpy enough that it probably won't protect your phone from a drop—just everyday scratches and scuffs. It's made from Portuguese cork, which is recyclable and biodegradable. Plus, trees aren't harmed whencork is harvested.
It works well with the wireless MagSafe Charger, and the MagSafe Wallet sticks to the case much better than with many other cases that claim to be MagSafe compatible.
A Fabric CaseIf you hate the feel of cool metal, try this suede case from German brand Arrivly. The artificial fibers are soft and velvety. Honestly, you might find yourself petting your phone more often than you use it. It will attract lint and pet hair fairly easily, but it's not difficult to clean. It's not a MagSafe case, but it works well with the MagSafe wireless charger (not so much with the MagSafe Wallet).
For Leather FansI like sleek and simple leather cases, so this one from Nomad is up my alley. It supports MagSafe, has a polycarbonate body with a thermoplastic elastomer bumper that's slightly raised along the edges, and the inside is lined with microfiber to protect the back of your iPhone. The supple leather is from a long-running tannery in Chicago (Horween), and the bottom has two spots where you can attach a lanyard or wrist strap. Nomad also hasnon-MagSafe versionsfor a little less.
★Another Leather Case:The vegetable-tanned leather inMujjo's case ($50)is just as soft as Nomad's, but it has a slimmer profile. The Nomad case will fare better in a major drop, but Mujjo's should survive minor bumps. It doesn't support MagSafe, but it works decently with the MagSafe Charger. I recommend thewallet versioninstead of Apple's MagSafe Wallet. The buttons require more effort to press.
A Case With a StrapNo pocket? No problem. Just dangle your iPhone from your wrist with Moshi's Altra case. The wrist strap is detachable, but notsodetachable that your iPhone will fly off. I really like the texture of the ribbed pattern on the back, and the buttons are easy to press. There's also a reasonably thick bumper around the frame. The front edges don't stick out much, so don't expect a ton of screen protection, and it doesn't work with MagSafe accessories (but can still wirelessly charge).
This caseiscompatible with Moshi's magnetic SnapTo series if you want to go all-in on Moshi accessories. There's a SnapTocar mount and a wall mount.
A MagSafe Portable BatteryThe beauty of MagSafe is you can slapanythingcompatible to the back of your iPhone 12. That includes a portable battery with built-in wireless charging. No need to deal with an annoying wire, or making sure to hold the two together so they wirelessly charge—Mophie's Snap+ Juice Pack Mini has magnets inside so it'll stay put. It has a 5,000-mAh battery, so it'll only charge your iPhone once, but it's so slim and compact that it's great to keep in your bag as an emergency back-up power (and you don't need to worry if you forgot the cable!). Just know that it charges a little slower at 7.5 watts, not the 15 watts other MagSafe wireless chargers are capable of.
What's nice is Mophie includes a magnetic snap adapter, which is a little ring with magnets on one side and 3M adhesive on the other. You can stick this ring to any other product that supports wireless charging to use it with Mophie's Snap+ battery for a hands-free charging experience. I attached it to my Google Pixel 5 and it works!Includes MagSafeMagSafe Wireless ChargersThere are a few brands that now sell MagSafe wireless chargers that are very similar to Apple's. Here are the models we like. Keep in mind that most of these brands don't include a power adapter, so you'll want one that's at least 20 watts (see below).
If You Have Apple's Wireless ChargerIf you have Apple'sMagSafe Chargerand are tired of it sliding around your bedside table, you can house it in a third-party pad or stand to keep it stable. That makes it harder to use the phone while charging, but if that's no issue, I like these options. Just remember, the wireless charger itself isn't included.
A Triple Wireless ChargerIf you have an iPhone, you may have other Apple-made products, like AirPods or the Apple Watch. If so, consider one system to charge all of them. I like this one from Belkin. It's completely MagSafe-compatible, so your iPhone 12 can hook up magnetically and will look like it's floating. The Apple Watch attaches to its charger magnetically, and there's a spot for the AirPods case on the base. The minimal design hides away most of the charger and elevates the gear more than any other 3-in-1 I've ever used, making for a very elegant system.
There's only one LED (for the AirPods), and it's not distracting at all. The best news is that it supports 15-watt output for the iPhone 12 range, so your iPhone will charge the fastest that's wirelessly possible.
Includes MagSafeAnother Option:Mophie's 3-in-1 charger ($140)is a great alternative if you'd rather avoid magnets. You can stand your iPhone on it, and there's space to plop your Apple Watch and AirPods. Since it doesn't charge via MagSafe, your phone will juice up slower than on the Belkin.
MagSafe WalletsIf you want to leave the wallet at home but don't want the bulk of a wallet case, there are several MagSafe options that stick to the back of your iPhone 12 (or a MagSafe case) so you can carry your transit cards or license. Just know that most of these wallets may get dislodged if you stuff your phone into a particularly tight pocket.
A Charging AdapterNone of the iPhone 12 models come withcharging adaptersin the box. Plus, the cable it does come with is a USB-C-to-Lightning; you might not have a USB-C power adapter lying around. Rather than buying an adapter from Apple, you should get this one from Anker. It's positively tiny—just a hair bigger than the 5-watt adapter that Apple used to include. However, the Nano Pro can output 20 watts, meaning it can fast-charge your iPhone. It only took around an hour to juice up my iPhone 12 Pro Max from 25 to 100 percent.
Alternatively, you can grabAnker's Nano II 65-watt adapter ($50). This one has enough power to recharge your MacBook Pro, and it will safely charge your iPhone as well.
A Durable CableIf you're using a mangled Apple-made cable to recharge your iPhone, it might be time for an upgrade. Apple's included cable isfine, but I've seen too many in tatters to believe it will withstand long-term abuse. I like Nimble's knit fabric USB-C–to–Lighting cables. They're made from recycled plastic and aluminum, are BPA- and PVC-free, and they ship in plastic-free packaging. They're also just plain attractive.
Lenses for ShutterbugsThe iPhone 12 range has excellent cameras, but you can take them a step further by attaching third-party lenses. Moment makes my favorites, including the 58-mm telephoto for zooming in closer and the 15-mm fisheye for a fun, ultrawide-angle effect. They take seconds to attach, though you'll need to usea Moment case. The company has other great accessories too, like itsCineBloom filterif you want a specific look in your videos.
The case supports MagSafe, and, more interestingly, I really like thearray of MagSafe mountsyou can use for camera accessories. These include a Wall Mount, a Cold Shoe Mount to attach things like portable video lights or microphones, and a Tripod Mount. They sit securely on the back and make filming with an iPhone elegant.
Another Option:Sandmarcalso makes great lenses that attach to its very own cases. Just screw the lens on the back of the case and you're good to go. It's aMagSafe case ($40), so you don't need to worry about magnetic compatibility with other accessories, and the brand has agood selection of lensesandfilters.
Includes MagSafeA MagSafe TripodThe worst part about using tripods is the process of securing a camera over the top, or stretching out jaws to clamp them over your phone. With this MagSafe tripod, all you need to do is hold the iPhone to the magnetic mount. That's it—it's secure. It does have jaws that you can twist forward if you need extra security (or you're using another phone), and threads to attach a video light or microphone. It comes with the classic GorillaPod stand you can contort to suit the surface it's on, but you can also attach the mount to most other tripods.
Find Your GearFrequently misplacing your keys, backpack, or wallet? One of the easiest ways for you to keep tabs on your gear is to use Apple'sAirTag(though it'snot without its flaws). You pair it with the Find My app that's preinstalled on Apple devices, and put it in your bag, in your wallet, or on your keychain. If it's nearby, you'll see it on the map and can track it down fairly precisely. If itisn't, don't worry. You'll not only see the last known location, but AirTags also leverages all nearby Apple devices to try and ping its location back to you. You just need to wait until someone with an Apple gadget walks by.
We've rounded up other gadgets you can use totrack your gear here. Want to track your dog or your kid? We've gotoptions for that too!Avoid These Accessories!I'm not sure what's going on over at Otterbox's headquarters, but of the dozens of accessories I've tested for this guide, Otterbox makes the only three that I wholeheartedly do not recommend: theOtterbox Strada Wallet Folio ($70),Otterbox Wallet for MagSafe ($40), andOtterbox Folio Wallet MagSafe case ($40). Yikes.
With the Strada, the leather doesn't feel real, the volume buttons are impossible to press without extraordinary pressure, and you can fit only two to three credit cards in it. The MagSafe wallet feels shoddy and weirdly sticky. It attracts a ton of dust and lint. The magnet also isn't very strong. Finally, the Folio wallet case is just too darn flappy. The front cover slides all over the iPhone's display, almost as if it was made for a different phone. Stay away.
