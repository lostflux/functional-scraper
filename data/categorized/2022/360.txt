Accurate dimensional control will ensure that the exacting tolerances required for machine operation are achieved, and by the end of the process metrologists will have recorded the exact as-built geometry of the machine—an invaluable source of information for future maintenance, modifications or revision.

For large-volume metrology applications, the reference base typically takes the form of a survey network that consists of a collection of target "nests" and/or instrument stations that have known geometry and computed uncertainty.

The accuracy requirements for each network vary according to the alignment tasks for which they are designed.

This is especially important when defining the as-built magnetic axis of the machine and the subsequent alignment of components against this.

This is critical for the successful operation of the ITER machine.

Metrology accompanied the operation, from rehearsal to the component's final arrival in the pit.
GalleryAdjusting a correction coilWorkers from the CNPE Consortium are seen here carrying out metrology measurements at the bottom of the Tokamak pit, adjusting a kidney-shaped bottom correction coil on its yellow temporary supports. Final positioning will be possible only when all vacuum vessel modules are in place.
05 January 2022FocusedA metrology instrument has been fixed to a port cell (right), with its camera trained on the centre of the assembly pit. During the assembly phase and beyond, metrology processes ensure that the machine and its supporting systems are dimensionally compliant.
03 January 2022First correction coil loweredThe lowering of the BCC/4 coil onto its temporary supports goes smoothly in October, thanks to detailed preparation that included metrology, reverse engineering and accurate positioning. In the final machine geometry, the correction coils will be attached to the toroidal field coil superstructure.
21 October 2021Major alignment achievementThe four major components of the first building block of the ITER plasma chamber have been precisely aligned (here, a view of the vacuum vessel taken from inside the sub-assembly). This major achievement smooths the way for the similar assembly of eight other sub-assemblies in the months and years ahead.
04 October 2021Precision is vitalPrecision in assembling and positioning the vacuum vessel sub-assembly components is paramount; any deviation from required tolerances in any component would result in knock-on issues in the sub-assembly and the finalized torus.
04 October 2021Ring coil PF5 installed successfullyThe coil slowly descends into the assembly pit on 16 September 2021. It will make a long pause for final metrology before being delicately deposited on its temporary supports.
16 September 2021Planarity checksLifting and positioning huge components, like this 17-metre-in-diameter poloidal field coil (PF5) demands a perfect balancing of the lifting hooks and a constant check for planarity. The metrology teams are essential.

This real-time photogrammetry permits operators to verify that the deformation of component as it is raised to vertical does not exceed limits.
17 June 2021In the Tokamak pitMetrology is an essential tool for installing components to within tight tolerances, controlling the interfaces berween the different elements, and keeping the right distances between surfaces in order to avoid clashes.
04 June 2021Verifying component shapePhotogrammetry is one of the techniques used to inspect and validate the shape of components. The bright points in the picture are photogrammetry targets placed on the outer shell of a vacuum vessel segment before final machining. Mangiarotti, Italy, May 2021.
27 May 2021Measurements at every stepAs the silver-coated panels of the lower cryostat thermal shield are assembled, metrologists are constantly at hand to verify alignment.
06 November 2020The eye in the pitAt the centre of the pit, a rotating "eye" blinks red and green atop a tall structure. The eye is the central piece of a metrology system that monitors a component's potential deformations by computing data acquired from several dozen targets.
30 October 2020Camera in placeThe first panel of the lower cryostat thermal shield is in place and metrologists verify that assembly can continue.
27 October 2020Counting on metrologyThe cryostat lower cylinder is now positioned in the Tokamak pit above the cryostat base and the remaining gap is less than 6 millimetres. Before welding activities begin, the exact position of the lower cylinder is recorded through metrology.
09 September 2020A rotational tolerance of +/- 5 mmBecause rotating the heavy cryostat base during installation would be difficult, metrologists were on hand as the base entered the Assembly Hall to make sure the transporter positioned the component exactly as it must be lifted by the overhead cranes. The team managed to achieve a rotational tolerance of +/- 5 mm.
04 May 2020Clear lines of sightThe team anticipated the arrival of the cryostat base in the Assembly Hall by installing one instrument station high up on the nearest sector sub-assembly tool (you can see the instrument if you look closely) for a clear line of sight.
04 May 20205-degree incrementsIn the Assembly Hall, the steel upending tool is lifted by increments of 5 degrees. A photogrammetric survey is performed between lifts in order to acquire baseline measurements and to monitor deformations.
02 March 2020Pre-assembly preparationsThe upending tool is lifted off the floor so that metrologists can measure the planarity of its support pads.
24 February 2020Aligning loads vertical to gravityWhen two 340-tonne test loads were positioned on one of the sector sub-assembly tools in the Assembly Hall, the metrology team was there to help the operators align the loads vertical to gravity and within one millimetre. The team has established the Tokamak Complex Global Coordinate network for the alignment of components, as well as a local coordinate system in the Assembly Hall for vacuum vessel sector sub-assembly.

06 May 2019For the alignment of machine components and plant systemsA vast network of fiducial target nests installed on the concrete surfaces of the bioshield, port cells and galleries will enable installation contractors to align components to sub-millimetre accuracy. Advanced software was used to lay out the positions of each instrument station and simulate clear lines of sight to the fiducial nests. This simulated measurement geometry was used to predict the measurement uncertainty to be expected, which was subsequently qualified with real measurement data. (Pictured: one level of the Tokamak Complex)12 November 2018Fiducial target nests2,000 of these small fiducial tests will be placed by European building contractors in accessible areas of the Tokamak Complex. The nests are used to receive spherically mounted reflectors (SMRs), which are surveyed with laser trackers to establish their coordinate values and confirm their compliance with the simulation used during the network design process. Photo: F4E15 October 2018Helping to erect of the giant toolsBefore and after each component of the sector sub-assembly tool (SSAT) is preassembled and put into place, metrology engineers carry out a variety of measurements and computational analysis to verify that every component is assembled and positioned in accordance with its design requirements.
12 February 2018Several metrology tools necessaryDue to the size of the vacuum vessel sector sub-assembly tool (SSAT), several metrology instrument positions are needed to achieve the best precision measurements. A network of target nests embedded in the ground of the Assembly Building helps position the instruments around the SSAT.

Two additional temporary monuments were used during the surveys to shorten the measurement distance to improve the accuracy. On top of the monument is a Leica GPS Receiver. Photo: ITER Organization (Pictured: contractors from GDV Systems GmbH, Germany)In-vessel photogrammetry survey simulationIn this illustration, the field of view for each camera is modelled and used to identify measurable targets. This array of cameras is repeated 18 times toroidially around the ITER vacuum vessel.
The ITER pit survey networkThe ITER pit survey network will consist of approximately 220 target nests mounted to the bioshield wall at the port cell openings. Metrology instruments mounted on dedicated stands, within the port cells, will extend through the cryostat ports into the pit to measure and align tokamak components with respect to this network. Lines of sight have been carefully studied to ensure that the network remains available throughout construction of the principle tokamak components.
9000 measurement targets to simulate in-vessel surveyOnce assembly is complete, a survey will be carried out to determine the as-built position of the interfaces for in-vessel components. Using software tools developed specifically for ITER, a survey simulation was carried out to determine achievable accuracy. 9,000 measurement targets were simulated using the CAD file as a template, to represent targeting the complete vacuum vessel.
Photogrammetry simulationMeasurement geometry for the survey of the interface components of an inboard blanket shield module. Photogrammetry simulation is used to predict the measurement uncertainty.
Accuracy of approximately 1 mmThe first survey of the ITER Primary Survey Network, as well as subsequent monitoring surveys, was carried out using a combination of terrestrial measurements (pictured here with a Leica Total station) combined with differential GPS and levelling measurements. An accuracy of approximately 1 mm was achieved for these surveys.
Virtual assembly of vacuum vessel tripletThe vacuum vessel sectors shall be aligned and welded as pairs and then triplets. The 3 triplets will then be aligned and simultaneously welded together. The as-built geometry of the various sectors shall be dimensionally controlled throughout this process to ensure that the required tolerances are maintained. This image, produced through a virtual assembly process, indicates how manufacturing and assembly variation can be visually represented as compared with the CAD model.
Vacuum vessel sector surveyAlignment of the vacuum vessel sectors will require a survey from multiple instruments to measure their large volume and to minimize measurement uncertainty. This image shows measurements from five laser tracker stations with lines of sight indicated to both in-vessel and ex-vessel fiducial target points.

It is based on 11 geodetic pillars that have been measured in relation to one another and to a wider GPS system, and which now provide a fixed reference base (or datum) from which more localized measurements can be made and calculated.

Metrologists will be able to access the overall coordinate system from any location by measuring a small number of local reference points. The accuracy of the network has been measured within a global uncertainty range of 0.2 to 0.4 mm, allowing installation contractors to align components to sub-millimetre accuracy.

The cryostat base will be aligned using the target nests of the Tokamak Pit Network; the toroidal field coils and cryostat lower cylinder will be aligned in relation to the as-built position of the cryostat base; and the coordinate frame of the 18 toroidal field coils will serve as reference for the final alignment of the vacuum vessel, the remaining magnet systems and the in-vessel components.

Manufactured in plants around the world and shipped to ITER, several thousand components must be customized during assembly to achieve the demanding tolerances allocated to in-vessel systems. As a single example, the assembly of the blanket modules inside the vessel requires a survey of approximately 4,400 components; each one needs to be individually customized to deliver the required alignment.
