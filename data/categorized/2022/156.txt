Driven by its core purpose—unlocking the potential of those who advance the world—and fueled by some of the brightest minds in the industry, BCG has helped countless businesses realize their digital ambitions by harnessing the combined power of new technologies like artificial intelligence and human capabilities to drive growth, innovation, transformation and change. But sometimes, even the transformation consultants need to transform a little themselves.
That’s why BCG is partnering with the team at WIRED, one of the nation’s foremost technology publications, to help tell the story of how artificial intelligence is not only affecting the world right now, but how it promises to shape our lives for years to come.
“The work that we do—helping businesses strike the right partnership between human and tech to unlock their full potential—affects how people, processes, culture, and strategy come together for a company but also society,” said Vladimir Lukic, Managing Director and Partner at BCG. “There’s a broader context to what we do and that’s the story we want to tell.”Together, WIRED and BCG are proud to present a newcontent database—devoted entirely to artificial intelligence—that provides that context. Built for business leaders, AI enthusiasts, and the curious minded, this database is designed to be a key resource in how both businesses and the public alike understand the real-world implications of AI—and how to plan for its future.
The new, searchable database blends the best of WIRED’s AI editorial content with BCG’s wide variety of use cases, sourced from years of experience in building and implementing practical AI solutions for organizations of all shapes and sizes. Behind a team of more than 1,300 data scientists and AI experts, BCG has built a deep history of these impactful case studies because that caliber of work has been its primary focus. BCG isn’t just an AI thought leader—it’s an AIimpactleader.
The WIRED team has long focused on the intersection of technology and humanity—how our species crafts new and innovative technologies, and in turn how those technologies shape the lives we live. BCG shares this ambition, focusing on the importance of “bionic” companies: organizations that seek to combine the strengths of people and technology to create and scale extraordinary opportunities. The story of this partnership is fundamentally a human one—because humans are a fundamental part of AI’s future.
Now is the right time to explore this story with you. AI’s capabilities are scaling exponentially, but more importantly, the COVID-19 pandemic has forced a new kind of global digital transformation for businesses and individuals alike. All of us are interfacing with AI solutions more than ever before—and that means we must recognize their impact accordingly.
BCG understands commercial AI solutions better than anyone. WIRED understands the technology enthusiast better than anyone. Together, we’re ready to share not just our stories, but your stories—humankind’s stories. BCG has been an integral part of AI’s past and present.
Now we’ll all be a central part of its future.
