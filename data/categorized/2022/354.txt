Stockfish (chess)Stockfishis afree and open-sourcechess engine, available for various desktop and mobile platforms. It can be used inchess softwarethrough theUniversal Chess Interface.
Stockfish is consistently ranked first or near the top of most chess-engine rating lists and is the strongest CPU chess engine in the world.
[3]It has won theTop Chess Engine Championship11 times.
Stockfish is developed by Marco Costalba, Joona Kiiski, Gary Linscott, Tord Romstad, Stéphane Nicolet, Stefan Geschwentner, and Joost VandeVondele, with many contributions from a community of open-source developers.
[4]It is derived from Glaurung, an open-source engine by Tord Romstad released in 2004.
ContentsFeatures[edit]Stockfish can use up to 512CPU threadsinmultiprocessorsystems. The maximal size of itstransposition tableis 32 TB. Stockfish implements an advancedalpha–beta searchand usesbitboards. Compared to other engines, it is characterized by its great search depth, due in part to more aggressivepruning, andlate move reductions.
[5]As of May 2022[update], Stockfish 15 (4-threaded) achieves anElo ratingof 3544+34−34on the CCRL 40/15 benchmark.
[6]Stockfish supportsChess960, which is one feature that was inherited from Glaurung.
TheSyzygytablebasesupport, previously available in aforkmaintained by Ronald de Man, was integrated into Stockfish in 2014.
[7]In 2018 support for the 7-men Syzygy was added, shortly after becoming available.
History[edit]The program originated fromGlaurung, an open-source chess engine created by Romstad and first released in 2004. Four years later, Costalba, inspired by the strong open-source engine, decided to fork the project. He named itStockfishbecause it was "produced in Norway and cooked in Italy" (Romstad is Norwegian, Costalba is Italian). The first version, Stockfish 1.0, was released in November 2008.
[8][9]For a while, new ideas and code changes were transferred between the two programs in both directions, until Romstad decided to discontinue Glaurung in favor of Stockfish, which was the more advanced engine at the time.
[10]The last Glaurung version (2.2) was released in December 2008.
Around 2011, Romstad decided to abandon his involvement with Stockfish in order to spend more time on his new iOS chess app.
[citation needed]On 18 June 2014 Marco Costalba announced that he had "decided to step down as Stockfish maintainer" and asked that the community create a fork of the current version and continue its development.
[11]An official repository, managed by a volunteer group of core Stockfish developers, was created soon after and currently manages the development of the project.
[12]In June 2020, anefficiently updatable neural network(NNUE) fork introduced bycomputer shogiprogrammers called Stockfish NNUE was discussed by developers.
[13][14]In July 2020 chess news reported that Stockfish NNUE had "broken new ground in computer chess by incorporating a neural network into the already incredibly powerful Stockfish chess engine."[15]A NNUEmergeinto Stockfish was then announced and development builds became available.
[16][17]"The NNUE branch maintained by @nodchip has demonstrated strong results and offers great potential, and we will proceed to merge ... This merge will introduce machine learning based coding to the engine, thus enlarging the community of developers, bringing in new skills. We are eager to keep everybody on board, including all developers and users of diverse hardware, aiming to be an inclusive community ...the precise steps needed will become clearer as we proceed, I look forward to working with the community to make this happen!"On 2 September 2020, the twelfth version of Stockfish was released, incorporating the aforementioned neural network improvement. According to the blog announcement, this new version "plays significantly stronger than any of its predecessors", typically winning ten times more game pairs than it loses when matched against version eleven.
[18][19]Fishtest[edit]Since 2013, Stockfish has been developed using adistributedtesting framework namedFishtest, where volunteers can donate CPU time for testing improvements to the program.
[20][21][22]Changes to game-playing code are accepted or rejected based on results of playing of tens of thousands of games on the framework against an older "reference" version of the program, usingsequential probability ratio testing. Tests on the framework are verified using thechi-squared test, and only if the results are statistically significant are they deemed reliable and used to revise the software code.
After the inception of Fishtest, Stockfish experienced an explosive growth of 120Elo pointsin just 12 months, propelling it to the top of all major rating lists.
[23]In Stockfish 7, Fishtest author Gary Linscott was added to the official list of authors in acknowledgement of his contribution to Stockfish's strength.
As of March 2022, the framework has used a total of more than 6800 years of CPU time to play over 4 billion chess games.
[24]Platforms[edit]Release versions and development versions are available asC++source codeand as precompiled versions forMicrosoft Windows,macOS,Linux32-bit/64-bit andAndroid.
Stockfish has been a very popular engine on various platforms. On desktop, it is the default chess engine bundled with theInternet Chess Clubinterface programs BlitzIn and Dasher. On mobile, it has been bundled with the Stockfish app, SmallFish and Droidfish. Other Stockfish-compatiblegraphical user interfaces(GUIs) includeFritz, Arena, Stockfish for Mac, andPyChess.
[25][26]Stockfish can be compiled toWebAssemblyorJavaScript, allowing it to run in the browser. Bothchess.comandLichessprovide Stockfish in this form in addition to a server-side program.
[27]Competition results[edit]Top Chess Engine Championship[edit]Stockfish is aTCECmultiple-time champion and the current leader in trophy count. Ever since TCEC restarted in 2013, Stockfish has finished first or second in every season except one. In TCEC Season 4 and 5, Stockfish finished runner-up, with Superfinal scores of 23–25 first againstHoudini3 and later againstKomodo1142. Season 5 was notable for the winning Komodo team as they accepted the award posthumously for the program's creatorDon Dailey, who succumbed to an illness during the final stage of the event. In his honor, the version of Stockfish that was released shortly after that season was named "Stockfish DD".
[28]On 30 May 2014, Stockfish 170514 (a development version of Stockfish 5 with tablebase support) convincingly won TCEC Season 6, scoring 35.5–28.5 against Komodo 7x in the Superfinal.
[29]Stockfish 5 was released the following day.
[30]In TCEC Season 7, Stockfish again made the Superfinal, but lost to Komodo with the score of 30.5–33.5.
[29]In TCEC Season 8, despite losses on time caused by buggy code, Stockfish nevertheless qualified once more for the Superfinal, but lost the ensuing 100-game match 46.5–53.5 to Komodo.
[29]In Season 9, Stockfish defeated Houdini 5 with a score of 54.5 versus 45.5.
[29][31]Stockfish finished third during season 10 of TCEC, the only season since 2013 in which Stockfish had failed to qualify for the superfinal. It did not lose a game, but was still eliminated because it was unable to score enough wins against lower-rated engines. After this technical elimination, Stockfish went on a long winning streak, winning seasons 11 (59 vs. 41 against Houdini 6.03),[29][32]12 (60 vs. 40 against Komodo 12.1.1),[29][33]and 13 (55 vs. 45 against Komodo 2155.00)[29][34]convincingly.
[35]InSeason 14, Stockfish faced a new challenger inLeela Chess Zero, but managed to eke out a win by one game (50.5–49.5).
[29][36]Its winning streak was finally ended inseason 15, when Leela qualified again and won 53.5–46.5,[29]but Stockfish promptly wonseason 16, defeating AllieStein 54.5–45.5, after Leela failed to qualify for the superfinal.
[29]Inseason 17, Stockfish faced Leela again in the superfinal, losing 52.5–47.5. However, Stockfish convincingly defeated Leela in the next four superfinals: 53.5–46.5 inseason 18, 54.5–45.5 inseason 19, 53–47 inseason 20, and 56–44 inseason 21.
[29]Stockfish also took part in the TCEC cup, winning the first edition, but was surprisingly upset by Houdini in the semifinals of the second edition.
[29][37]Stockfish recovered to beat Komodo in the third place playoff.
[29]In the third edition, Stockfish made it to the finals, but was defeated byLeela Chess Zeroafter blundering in a 7-manendgame tablebasedraw. It turned this result around in the fourth edition, defeating Leela in the final 4.5–3.5.
[29]Chess.com Computer Chess Championship[edit]Ever sincechess.comhosted its firstChess.com Computer Chess Championshipin 2018, Stockfish has been the most successful engine. It dominated the earlier championships, winning six consecutive titles before finishing second in CCC7. Since then, its dominance has come under threat from the neural-network engines Leelenstein andLeela Chess Zero, but it has continued to perform well, reaching at least the superfinal in every edition up to CCC11. CCC12 had for the first time a knockout format, with seeding placing CCC11 finalists Stockfish and Leela in the same half. Leela eliminated Stockfish in the semi-finals. However, a post-tournament match against the loser of the final, Leelenstein, saw Stockfish winning in the same format as the main event.
Stockfish versus AlphaZero[edit]In December 2017, Stockfish 8 was used as a benchmark to testGoogledivisionDeepMind'sAlphaZero, with each engine supported by different hardware. AlphaZero was trained through self-play for a total of nine hours, and reached Stockfish's level after just four.
[127][128][129]In 100 games from the normal starting position, AlphaZero won 25 games as White, won 3 as Black, and drew the remaining 72, with 0 losses.
[130]AlphaZero also played twelve 100-game matches against Stockfish starting from twelve popular openings for a final score of 290 wins, 886 draws and 24 losses, for a point score of 733:467.
[131][note 2]AlphaZero's victory over Stockfish sparked a flurry of activity in the computer chess community, leading to a new open-source engine aimed at replicating AlphaZero, known asLeela Chess Zero. By January 2019, Leela was able to defeat the version of Stockfish that played AlphaZero (Stockfish 8) in a 100-game match. An updated version of Stockfish narrowly defeated Leela Chess Zero in the superfinal of the14th TCEC season, 50.5–49.5 (+10 =81 −9),[29]but lost the superfinal of thenext seasonto Leela 53.5–46.5 (+14 =79 -7).
[29][133]The two engines remain very close in strength to each other even as they continue to improve: Leela defeated Stockfish in the superfinal ofTCEC Season 17, but Stockfish wonTCEC Season 18,TCEC Season 19,TCEC Season 20, andTCEC Season 21, each time defeating Leela in the superfinal.
Stockfish versus Nakamura[edit]Stockfish's strength relative to the best human chess players was most apparent in a handicap match with grandmasterHikaru Nakamura(2798-rated) in August 2014. In the first two games of the match, Nakamura had the assistance of an older version ofRybka, and in the next two games, he received White with pawn odds but no assistance. Nakamura was the world's fifth-best human chess player at the time of the match, while Stockfish was denied use of its opening book and endgame tablebase. Stockfish won each half of the match 1.5–0.5. Both of Stockfish's wins arose from positions in which Nakamura, as is typical for his playing style, pressed for a win instead of acquiescing to a draw.
