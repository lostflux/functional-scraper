Changelog: Covid Tracing Tracker updates as they happenTechnology Review isrunning a project to monitorand observe the development and deployment of automated contact tracing apps aimed at curbing the spread of covid-19.
Each weekday we review submissions, source information andupdate our database. This page lists changes, documentation, and reasoning where it is required.
If you have a change to submit to the database,here's how to do it.
Wednesday Dec 23Monday November 16We have updated usage numbers for 12 major countries in the public version of ourunderlying spreadsheet.
India’s limitation rating was upgraded because these limitations are now outlined in its privacy policy. However we’ve downgraded India’s transparency rating, having previously upgraded it when the app was made open source. Despite that, trust amongst usersremains lowand more government outreach around trust and transparency seems necessary.
ForJapan, we’ve changed the name of the government agency, added Bluetooth to the tech, and upgraded its rating for use limitation based on theprivacy policy.
In thePhilippines, data will be retained for anundeterminedamount of time. We’ve downgraded the data destruction rating as a result.
We’ve upgradedGermany’s limitation rating.
France’s app was relaunched, and it is now calledTousAntiCovid. We have upgraded its use limitation rating based on the privacy policy.
For theUK, we’ve upgraded voluntariness, limitation, data destruction, minimization and transparency based on the privacy policy and the fact that it’s open source.
InAustralia, we’ve upgraded the transparency rating based on improved government responsiveness to inquiries.
Singapore’s voluntariness rating has been downgraded. TraceTogether is no longer voluntary; residents must either use the app or a wearable.

Monday June 29Switzerlandreports500,000 downloads of its app in the first 24 hours.

Northern Ireland, which is part of the UK,is developing its own appwith thesame vendoras IrelandInFrance, around 460,000 haveuninstalledthe app.
In theUnited Arab Emirates, there are two apps we're investigating, but more importantly the government announced that there are fines of up to Dh10.000 ($2,700) for anyone refusing to install or register for a smart tracking app. This appears to only apply to those ordered into quarantine, so we are still rating the app as "voluntary" for now, pending further investigation.
