A tunnel (and bridge) connect the ITER Control Building with Headquarters.
30 April 2021New construction zone for neutral beam powerBetween the Tokamak Complex and ITER Headquarters, a new construction project is underway. Two buildings and a technical zone for the neutral beam power supplies are planned. © Les Nouveaux Médias/SNC ENGAGE26 February 2021Rooftop HVAC installationAll HVAC equipment has now been installed on the roof of the Tokamak Assembly Preparatory Building.
25 January 2021Work begins on a new set of buildingsOn a level area in front of the Tokamak Complex, karst investigation and excavation has started for a series of buildings (two buildings and one technical area) that will be dedicated to the power supply of the neutral beam heating system.
21 January 2021TAPB building, finished on timeThe Tokamak Assembly Preparation Building (TAPB) construction team completed this building to nuclear specifications in nine months. The team was recognized by a 2020 ITER Award, winning in the "Balance-of-Plant Systems" category in December.
08 January 2021Space neededThe need for storage and workshop spaces is high on the ITER site and every ounce of space must be utilized. This additional building just went up near the European Poloidal Field Coils Winding Facility. © Les Nouveaux Médias/SNC ENGAGE22 December 2020Under the surfaceOur eyes are mostly focused on work happening above the platform ... but a lot is happening just under the surface to ensure that power, water and services are distributed around the platform. © Les Nouveaux Médias/SNC ENGAGE22 December 2020Still in its cocoonThe cryostat upper cylinder is still waiting in its protective cocoon to be called into the Assembly Hall. The lower cylinder was installed in August 2020. © Les Nouveaux Médias/SNC ENGAGE22 December 2020New structuresOn the northeastern corner of the platform, several new structures have emerged. Left: the Tokamak Assembly Preparatory Building; right: a new storage facility. Photo: ITER Organization/EJF Riche24 November 2020Preparations underway for a new buildingNear the Assembly Hall, groundwork has started for a new building that will house electrical switching equipment. Contractors are drilling regular holes to check for karsts (fissures) in the bedrock.
20 October 2020TAPB: fully erectedIn a northeastern corner of the platform, not far from the Assembly Hall, the Tokamak Assembly Preparatory Building is fully erected. It is a one-story building, with a full basement.
12 October 2020Managing AC currentWhat can be contained in a medium-size building in a steelworks or other heavy industrial facility requires a one-hectare yard at ITER. Adjacent to the Reactive Power Control Building (background), the reactive power compensators area accommodates reactors, capacitors, resistors and sensors that aim to smooth the flow of AC current both inside the ITER installation and in the immediate vicinity.
04 October 2020ITER fully connectedThree 400 kV transformers for the pulsed power electrical network (PPEN) have been energized. Going forward, the French operator RTE considers ITER as fully connected and operational, with all seven ITER connections at the 400kV level in operation. (There are three transformers for the pulsed power network and four for the steady state electrical network.)30 September 2020Machining workshop installed on siteThe new workshop will be operated by the DYNAMIC consortium, which was formed to execute one of ITER's two main machine assembly contracts, TAC2 (Tokamak Assembly Contract 2). The workshop will be a space for repairs and retrofitting, and boasts two milling machines, a large CNC (Computer Numeric Control) machine, and spaces for welding and metrology.

29 March 2019An unassuming name, a strategic buildingDespite a rather unassuming name, the Site Services Building is a strategic resource for the entire installation, accommodating and distributing a large number of industrial support services and systems. All mechanical and electrical equipment (pumps, chillers, pressurizers, cabinets and chemical dosing systems) and relevant piping has been installed, and a series of hydrostatic tests have been completed successfully.
12 December 2018Ready to serve the installation in 2019Installation works in the Site Services Building have been completed on time, despite a complicated context of limited space, numerous interfaces and coordination. Eight 25-tonne chillers are installed at right (plus their soft starters in yellow).
12 December 2018Important arteriesCable drums are lined up outside of the ITER cryoplant, where tray laying and cable pulling activities are about to start. A total of 10,000 kilometres of cables will be needed at ITER to connect components, provide power and transmit data.
