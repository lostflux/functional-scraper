AboutMachineScienceConstructionAssemblyNews & MediaTopFuture control roomLooking southwest, with the Tokamak Complex in the background, this is the 43 m x 18 m main control room. Its steel structure is in place and roof cladding will soon be installed. The room will have a raised floor 70 centimetres above the present slab to accommodate the dense cabling that will transport power and data to the various control desks.
05 May 2022Control centre risingWork is progressing on the 3,500-square metre, three-storey ITER Control Building. Scientists, engineers and operators will work from here to monitor machine operation and analyze the data they receive from each pulse.
05 May 2022Future server roomSmaller than the main control room, the main server room (30 m x 13 m) will also have a raised floor to house the cabling carrying large amounts of data to and from the numerous CODAC cubicles. Concrete works have been finalized in this area and waterproofing is ongoing on the roof slab in order to commence interior finishing work.
05 May 2022Meeting room with a viewOn southeastern side of the building, a meeting room with large glazed openings will provide an unobstructed view of the Tokamak Complex and the heat rejection area—a nice change from the numbers and graphs on the operators' computer screens.
05 May 2022Control Building, part twoWork has started on the steel structure of the ITER Control Building.
21 February 2022Control Building: 24-hour presenceThe Control Building, going up now on the ITER site, will be the daily work environment for the operators, researchers, and engineers running ITER physics experiments or the routine 24-hour operation and control functions of the machine and plant.
08 December 2021News from the northern cornerThe Control Building is rising on the northern corner of the construction site. Also visible in the aerial shot: the solar panels that now cover the ITER staff parking lot.

15 October 2021Control Building risingBetween ITER Headquarters and the cooling towers (background), a new building project is underway—the (non-nuclear) Control Building, from which scientists, engineers and operators will follow every pulse. A smaller (nuclear) Control Building will be erected at a later date as an emergency fallback area.
27 September 2021Starting on the Control BuildingWork has started on the site of the ITER Control Building. A tunnel (and bridge) connect the ITER Control Building with Headquarters.

A nuclear building will go up at a later date, between the main control room and the cooling towers visible in the background. © Enia Architectes, FranceThe inner structureThe building superstructure is made of four independent concrete blocks, separated by structural joints, and a network of steel reinforcement. It should be completed by summer 2022.
