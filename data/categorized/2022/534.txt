"fake-h3">Key information"fake-h3">Applications are now closedOverviewOur Master's in Bioinformatics and Theoretical Systems Biology is a multidisciplinary research-based degree, designed for applicants with a biological, biomedical, physical sciences, computational or mathematical background.
The programme is taught by experts in relevant fields within the College.
You will gain the necessary skills to produce effective research in bioinformatics and theoretical systems biology.
Study programmeThe programme starts with a training phase in the autumn term, where you acquire core biological, computational and mathematics skills through lectures in bioinformatics and theoretical systems biology.
For the remainder of the autumn term, you will cover the taught elements of the course, which is comprised of lectures, practical classes and assignments.
This is followed by full-time research projects that last for the rest of the academic year, under the supervision of researchers at Imperial.
As the curriculum is under review, there could be two or three of these research projects. All projects involve liaising with biologists, mathematicians and computing specialists.

StructureCore modulesYou take all of the core modules below.
Research projectsYou take the following research projects. Projects start in the Spring term and last for the rest of the academic year. All projects must be taken at Imperial College and supervised by a member of Imperial College.
Computing ProjectThis project is designed to reinforce programming skills and provide an opportunity to experience creation of code in detail. This is normally undertaken as a group project.
Data Analysis ProjectThis project involves working on the statistical and computational analysis of biological or biomedical datasets, possibly in collaboration with experimental/clinical groups within Imperial. Depending on the outcome of the curriculum review, this project may be dropped, and the time available to undertake the other two projects increased accordingly.
Bioinformatics and Systems Biology ProjectThis project provides a mechanism for the use of the skills obtained during the course in a research environment. You become part of your host laboratory within Imperial, including associated hospitals and Silwood Park. Many of these projects contribute directly to scientific publications.
