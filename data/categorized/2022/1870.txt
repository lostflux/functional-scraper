Master of Computer ScienceIntroductionThe Master of Science in Computer Science aims at equipping students with advanced skills in Computer Science.
The objectives of the program are :Main Features in the programAreas of SpecializationThe MSc in Computer Science program is an evening program that is completely privately sponsored. The curriculum has two areas of specialization:A student pursuing a MSc in Computer Science will be required to specialize in one of these tracks. The choice of the areas of specialization was dictated by the current trends and needs in the Computing fifield in the region and internationally.
Software and Systems SecurityUganda and the rest of the African continent have witnessed a tremendous increase in the adoption and use of automated computing systems. The region has also seen increase in the usage of the Internet and online IT systems. Computerization increases precision, speed, reliability, availability and reduces cost. Computerization has been applied in sensitive/critical areas like finance (e.g., mobile money and online banking), records keeping, monitoring and tracking.
Design and implementing secure computer systems is an ever increasing challenge worldwide. Unfortunately, most organizations put emphasis on the functionality of the computerized systems but pay less attention on the susceptibility of the systems to malicious attack by intruders. Without proper implementation of security, organizations could suffer from high security risks including fifinancial losses. In some cases, businesses can be thrown several years back and rendered uncompetitive.
There is shortage of computer security professionals in Uganda and internationally. The Software and Systems Security track therefore aims at producing computer security experts who will be able to design, develop, implement and manage secure computing systems and networks. The graduates will also be able to critically evaluate threats and vulnerabilities and integrate appropriate security strategies in computing systems and networks.
Artificial Intelligence and Data ScienceThe Artificial Intelligence and Data Science option aims at producing graduates equipped with skills to process, analyse and extract insight from huge amounts of data. It draws upon our world-leading expertise in the areas of machine learning, computer vision and image processing, visual analytics, high-performance computing, data mining and information retrieval.
There is a growing demand of professionals with this skills set because individuals and organizations are continuously producing vast amounts of real-time heterogeneous data (known as Big Data). Big Data challenge in areas such as health, business, security,intelligent transport, energy efficiency, education, retail and the creative industries.
This option will equip students with advanced knowledge and hands-on experience in algorithms, tools, and techniques for managing and processing big data.
Emphasis on Research, Problem Solving and TransdisciplinarityThe MSc in Computer Science program puts strong emphasis on research, transdisciplinarity and problem solving using advanced computational thinking skills.
This is because Computer Science is a highly ever-evolving field that demands keeping up with the most up-to-date research and trending advancements not only in Computer Science but also in other fields. Most graduates of Computer Science work in fast changing and technically challenging environments that require continuous research and learning.
In order to produce graduates who can work successful in the field of Computer Science, the curriculum ensures that the two offered options have a heavy component of research and problem solving. The modes of delivery and research problems are designed to equip students with skills to tackle inter and trans-disciplinary research abilitiesCareer Options Arising from the MSc in Computer Science programThe graduates from the MSc. in Computer Science find themselves in different kinds of environments for example, academia, research, industry, government, private and business organizations. The list below provides some of the possible career options for a graduate of the MSc. in Computer Science:The ProgramTarget GroupThe program is designed for graduates from computing (Computer Science, Computer Engineering, and Software Engineering) and closely related fields, who wish to gain advanced knowledge in Computer Science. The broad target groups include but not limited to:Program DurationThe duration of the program is four semesters spread in two years. Each semester has fifteen weeks of studying and two weeks of examinationsTuition FeesTuition fees for privately sponsored students is 5,000,000 Uganda Shillings per academic year for Ugandans and 12,780,000 Uganda Shillings for international students.
RegulationsAdmission requirementsTo qualify for admission to the MSc. in Computer Science, a candidate must fulfill the general Makerere University entry requirements for Masters Degrees, and in addition, the candidate must be a holder of either:Candidates from closely related fields should have taken core computer science courses in undergraduate or postgraduate diploma studies including: compiler design, automata and complexity, object-oriented programming languages, data structures and algorithms, computer architecture, mathematics particularly in linear algebra, statistics and calculus.
Upgrading from Postgraduate DiplomaIf a candidate holds a Postgraduate Diploma in Computer Science of Makerere University of at least a Lower Second class, he/she may apply to join in the second year of the Master of Science in Computer Science provided they have followed equivalent courses in the post graduate Diploma. In such a case, the applicant is expected to undertake research in the second year and any remaining course units to meet the minimum requirement for the award of the MSc. in Computer Science Degree.
The upgrade of the PGD Computer Science to the MSc. Computer Science described above must be supported by relevant academic documents attained for the PGD Computer Science of Makerere University. This must be done for purposes of analyzing the relevant academic courses that must have been attempted as per the current MSc. in Computer Science curriculum. Any courses that were not attempted by the applicant as per the first years course load of the current MSc. in Computer Science curriculum must be taken. When a student graduates with a Postgraduate Diploma of Computer Science of Makerere University with a classification of Pass, s/he can apply for the Master of Science in Computer Science but is admitted to the first year of the MSc. in Computer Science program.
PlansThe curriculum is made up of two plans - Plan A and Plan B.
Weighting SystemThe weighting unit is the Credit Unit (CU). The Credit Unit is a contact hour per week per semester. A contact hour is equal to:Semester LoadThe normal load for Year one is 20 credit units per semester. The normal semester load for Year Two Semesters One is 22 credit units for Plan A while that for Year two Semester one is 18 credit units for Plan B. The minimum semester load for Year two Semester two is 20 for Plan A while that for Year two Semester two for Plan B is 10 credit units.
Minimum Graduation LoadThe minimum graduation load for Plan A is 62 credit units while the minimum graduation load for Plan B is 68.
Evaluation and GradingEvery course unit will be graded within and at the end of the semester in which it is covered. The progressive assessment will constitute 40% of the overall mark and the final examination will constitute 60%. The form of progressive assessment and final examination (e.g., project-based/research-based or written) may vary depending on the course unit. Grade points will be allocated to the nal mark got in every course unit according to the table below:The following additional letters are used where appropriate:Calculation of Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA)The CGPA is calculated as follows:Where GPiis the Grade Point score of a particular course unit i; CUiis the number of Credit Units of course unit i; and n is the number of course units done so far.

Each module will be a complete unit of teaching and will be assessed at independently during continuous assessments. This course is broken up into the following modules;This module introduces the students to the major concepts of machine learning. It introduces why learning from examples is a powerful way of learning and generalizing. It introduces the broad kinds of learning; supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning. It introduces the concept of learning a function and selecting suitable hypotheses. It also introduces the ideas of bias and variance and generalization of a machine learning algorithm.
Uncertainty is a big concept in learning. Because learning is inherently uncertain, we introduce probabilistic reasoning to try and understand learning under uncertainty. Here the concepts of conditional probability are reiterated, Bayes rule and Bayesian reasoning. The Naive Bayes algorithm is introduced as well.
Supervised learning is the biggest branch of machine learning. It deals with learning from labeled data. Here we introduce the concepts of Classification. We look at two kinds of algorithms here; Support Vector Machines and Decision Trees. We explain the different parameters required to build these algorithms to generalize well given some data. We also introduce the K-Nearest Neighbour algorithm and discuss distance measures.
Here we introduce the other type of Supervised learning; regression. We discuss the concepts behind logistic regression. We derive analytically as well as simulate learning using gradient descent. We also introduce the concept of regularization to curb overfitting.

MCN 7105: Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (4 CU)(a) DescriptionEffective software engineers need to know efficient techniques that serve as building blocks in the design and implementation of software systems. This course covers a series of techniques for controlling complexity in large software systems. We control complexity by building abstractions that hide details when appropriate. We control complexity by establishing conventional interfaces that enable us to construct systems by combining standard, well-understood pieces in a \mix and match" way. As we confront increasingly complex problems, we find that existing programming languages are not sufficient for our needs and thus we must control complexity by establishing new programming languages in order to express our ideas more effectively. These techniques will be illustrated using a highly expressive language such as Scheme, Python or Clojure. However, the course is not about teaching a particular programming language but rather examines fundamental issues underlying the design decisions of programming languages. This course will forever change the way you think about programming and programming languages i.e., from a language user's view to a designer's view.
(b) Course Objectives:The objectives of this course are:(c) Learning outcomesUpon completion of the course, students should be able to:(d) Detailed Course Content:Introduction to Procedure abstraction; procedures as black-box ab- straction; computational processes; formulating abstractions with higher- order proceduresIntroduction to data abstraction; compound data; hierarchical data and the closure property; symbolic data; multiple representations of abstract data.
