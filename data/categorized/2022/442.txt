Announcing the Accepted Workshops at ICLR 2022Feryal Behbahani2022 ConferenceBy ICLR 2022 Workshop Chairs, Feryal Behbahani and VukosiMarivateWe want to thank everyone who submitted a proposal. We were very impressed by the quality of these proposals and thrilled to be able to include some of them as part of the ICLR program. We received 45 total submissions and accepted 19 workshops.
We also want to thank our team of reviewers, ICLR program committee and ICLR 2021 Workshop Chairs for their kind support.
The workshops will be held virtually (like the rest of the conference) in April 2022.
Selection ProcessUltimately we could not accept every proposal but we worked to balance a few goals. We wanted to have a good representation of theory, applications and innovative multidisciplinary workshops to broaden the ICLR community. Additionally, as we have a single day for workshops, we wanted each workshop to be able to attract a good number of attendees, hence we tried to avoid having workshops with very similar topics.
A team of invited volunteer reviewers reviewed each workshop proposal which was an important part of the selection process. We strived to have a good balance between topics and took into account the diversity of the speakers and organising team across multiple factors such as gender, institution, seniority and geographic location.
We will not be releasing the reviews directly, but will be making available short meta-reviews on CMT to summarise the feedback, highlighting the strengths and opportunities for improvement.
We are looking forward to all your contributions to the workshops!Accepted Workshops3rd Workshop on practical ML for Developing Countries: learning under limited/low resource scenariosAfricaNLP 2022: NLP for African languagesAI for Earth and Space ScienceDeep Generative Models for Highly Structured DataDeep Learning for CodeDeep Learning on Graphs for Natural Language ProcessingEmergent Communication: New FrontiersFrom Cells to Societies: Collective Learning Across ScalesGamification and Multiagent SolutionsGeneralizable Policy Learning in the Physical WorldGeometrical and Topological Representation LearningGroundedML: Anchoring Machine Learning in Classical Algorithmic TheoryMachine Learning for Drug Discovery (MLDD)PAIR^2Struct: Privacy, Accountability, Interpretability, Robustness, Reasoning on Structured DataSetting up ML Evaluation Standards to Accelerate ProgressSocially Responsible Machine LearningWiki-M3L: Wikipedia and Multimodal & Multilingual ResearchWorkshop on Agent Learning in Open-EndednessWorkshop on the Elements of Reasoning: Objects, Structure and CausalityAdditionally we are very excited to announce that there will be a workshop on CoSubmitting Summer (CSS) Program which will be the official conclusion of the1st CSS programfeaturing the 55 submitted projects.
