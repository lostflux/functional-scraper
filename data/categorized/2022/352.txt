We empower diverse voices to participate from ideation through implementation, striving for fairness, equity, and inclusion. Justice and equity is at the heart of PAI’s visionValues“Equity and Inclusion” is the first value on our list for a reasonRepresentationPAI is represented by a diverse makeup of staff, but we continue to focus our efforts on improving representation and recognize that it is only a part of the story. We believe that as a form of accountability, transparency in these efforts is critical. Currently, we are focused on building our pipeline of African American, Hispanic/LatinX, and Indigenious people. We also welcome all other forms of diversity, including LGBTQ+, Veteran, individuals with disabilities, and socioeconomic statusRecruitingAll open positions at PAI (board, full-time, fellowships, internships and consultants) must include interviews with finalist candidates from underrepresented backgrounds. On an annual basis, PAI will identify critical dimensions of diversity that are underrepresented within the organization, according to census data. Our approach sometimes has the potential to take longer, but we believe this to be a necessary means to staying true to our values.
