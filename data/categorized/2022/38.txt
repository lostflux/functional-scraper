Alba Espinosa RastollMSc in Artificial IntelligenceAfter studying a BEng in Aerospace Engineering at Queen Mary University, followed by an MSc in Advanced Aeronautical Engineering at Imperial, College, I worked for 2 years within the aerospace sector.
As a result of the 2020 lockdown, I started to spend some time learning about the rapidly growing field of AI, and its applications not only within the aerospace sector, but also across other industries such as healthcare. I therefore decided to apply to the MSc in Artificial Intelligence and return to university. This degree is allowing me to expand my AI knowledge across different domains such as Computer Vision or Reinforcement Learning, to find what I enjoy most, while meeting great people in my cohort from many different backgrounds.
When I am not doing AI, I enjoy swimming, cooking and going to the cinema.
The DeepMind scholarship has financially allowed me to return to university comfortably, has given me the opportunity to meet other DeepMind scholars around the globe and thanks to the mentorship, I am receiving invaluable guidance about my career and how AI is applied in industry.
Miriam FischerPhDMy background is in Economics and Computer Science. I hold two bachelor's degrees—in Economics and Computer Science—and a master's degree in Operational Research with Data Science. My interests lie at the interface of computer science and economics, which led me to the field of Algorithmic Game Theory, and which motivated further studies in optimisation and data science.
My PhD combines ideas from Algorithmic Game Theory, Optimisation, and data-driven decision making. Specifically, I am interested in developing more realistic models that reflect agents' behaviour in reality and the world they act in. This includes using data to infer the behaviour of agents, and to establish appropriate equilibrium notions for this setting. I also want to develop incentives that lead to socially enhanced behaviour of self-interested agents. I am also a first year student representative, voicing the opinions of fellow PhD students and working with staff to improve the graduate student experience.
The DeepMind scholarships funding my PhD is a great opportunity to interact with other DeepMind scholars and researchers. This is particularly exciting as it gives me insights into research in industry and allows me to develop a network in both academia and industry.
Suniyah MinhasMSc in Artificial IntelligenceIn 2019 I graduated from an integrated Masters in Mathematics and Physics from Durham University. I then went on to work as a Data Consultant, specialising in Data Engineering and the cloud. During my career, I heard a lot about the growing field of Machine Learning and Deep Learning and was eager to pursue this in more depth.
I feel incredibly lucky to be on such an amazing programme at Imperial. The course covers topics such as Reinforcement Learning, Computer Vision and Deep Learning in a lot of depth. The learning curve is steep, but extremely rewarding. I feel very supported by both the department and cohort of exceptionally talented students.
DeepMind’s support has been fundamental in helping me to pursue this course. From the generous financial aid to the incredible mentorship, I am so grateful to DeepMind for this opportunity. The Mentorship has allowed me access to people who have a wealth of understanding about the field. The Scholarship Programme has created a global network of scholars, so it is great to meet people in a similar position and with similar interests across the globe!2020–2021Lisa AlazrakiMSc in Computing (Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning)After studying Fine Art at Central Saint Martins I worked as a multimedia artist, drawing inspiration for my practice from developments in science and technology. As I began to read more about artificial intelligence, I became increasingly drawn to it and decided to return to academia to pursue a second undergraduate degree in computing and mathematics, with the aim to work and carry out research in this deeply fascinating field.
After graduating I was admitted to the MSc in Computing (Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning) at Imperial College. The degree is a perfect fit for my diverse interests since it offers modules in both statistical machine learning and logic-based artificial intelligence.
I was also lucky enough to receive a DeepMind scholarship, which has allowed me to continue my studies at postgraduate level through financial support and mentorship.
I am particularly grateful to my mentor at DeepMind, who has been helpful and supportive and has offered precious insight into building a career in A.I. and machine learning.
Victoria DerksMSc in Artificial IntelligenceMy interest in tech and cognition lead to combining them both through the MSc AI degree. I completed my undergraduate degree in psychology at University College London, which taught me psychological theory and neuroscience, but also research and basic coding. I realised that I enjoyed programming and tech as well as academic research and learning about behaviour. Artificial Intelligence, for me, follows from both interests: it’s the research and programming of systems that behave in complicated ways by learning from data.
I’m very lucky to have obtained a place on the competitive MSc AI degree. I wasn’t sure whether my non-traditional background would be enough to be admitted! Whereas psychology was pretty familiar, almost all material in the AI course is new to me and I’m learning a lot in a very short time. It’s exciting to learn about cutting edge technologies and implement methods that were detailed in papers published just months prior. That was definitely not the case in psychology, where papers from the 2000s were considered recent!Through the DeepMind scholarship, I have been assigned a lovely DeepMind mentor with a similar background to mine. He’s been crucial in helping me decide how to achieve my career goals and has given me insight into what it’s like to apply AI in industry. It also allowed me to meet the other three scholars on this webpage and even some DeepMind scholars in the USA. I’ve heard from experts in the industry, like DeepMind’s founders. Without DeepMind I wouldn’t have had these experiences which weren’t as academic but helped immensely in exploring life after graduation.
