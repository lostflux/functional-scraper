AdvertisementPrecision tomography of a three-qubit donor quantum processor in siliconNaturevolume601,pages348–353 (2022)Cite this article10kAccesses12Citations374AltmetricMetricsdetailsSubjectsAbstractNuclear spins were among the first physical platforms to be considered for quantum information processing1,2, because of their exceptional quantum coherence3and atomic-scale footprint. However, their full potential for quantum computing has not yet been realized, owing to the lack of methods with which to link nuclear qubits within a scalable device combined with multi-qubit operations with sufficient fidelity to sustain fault-tolerant quantum computation. Here we demonstrate universal quantum logic operations using a pair of ion-implanted31P donor nuclei in a silicon nanoelectronic device. A nuclear two-qubit controlled-Zgate is obtained by imparting a geometric phase to a shared electron spin4, and used to prepare entangled Bell states with fidelities up to 94.2(2.7)%. The quantum operations are precisely characterized using gate set tomography (GST)5, yielding one-qubit average gate fidelities up to 99.95(2)%, two-qubit average gate fidelity of 99.37(11)% and two-qubit preparation/measurement fidelities of 98.95(4)%. These three metrics indicate that nuclear spins in silicon are approaching the performance demanded in fault-tolerant quantum processors6. We then demonstrate entanglement between the two nuclei and the shared electron by producing a Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger three-qubit state with 92.5(1.0)% fidelity. Because electron spin qubits in semiconductors can be further coupled to other electrons7,8,9or physically shuttled across different locations10,11, these results establish a viable route for scalable quantum information processing using donor nuclear and electron spins.

MainNuclear spins are the most coherent quantum systems in the solid state3,12, owing to their extremely weak coupling to the environment. In the context of quantum information processing, the long coherence is associated with record single-qubit gate fidelities13. However, the weak coupling poses a challenge for multi-qubit logic operations. Using spin-carrying defects in diamond14and silicon carbide15, this problem can be addressed by coupling multiple nuclei to a common electron spin, thus creating quantum registers that can sustain small quantum logic operations and error correction16. Exciting progress is being made on linking several such defects via optical photons17,18.
Still missing, however, is a pathway to exploit the atomic-scale dimension of nuclear spin qubits to engineer scalable quantum processors, where densely packed qubits are integrated and operated within a semiconductor chip19. This requires entangling the nuclear qubits with electrons that can either be physically moved or entangled with other nearby electrons. It also requires interspersing the electron–nuclear quantum processing units with spin readout devices20. Here we show experimentally that silicon—the material underpinning the whole of modern digital information technology—is the natural system in which to develop dense nuclear spin-based quantum processors1.
One-electron–two-nuclei quantum processorThe experiments are conducted on a system of two31P donor atoms, introduced in an isotopically purified28Si substrate by ion implantation (seeMethods). A three-qubit processor is formed by using an electron (e) with spinS= 1/2 (basis states\(|\uparrow \rangle \),\(|\downarrow \rangle \)) and two nuclei (Q1, Q2) with spinI= 1/2 (basis states\(|\Uparrow \rangle \),\(|\Downarrow \rangle \)). Metallic structures on the surface of the chip provide electrostatic control of the donors, create a single-electron transistor (SET) charge sensor, and deliver microwave and radio-frequency signals through a broadband antenna (Fig.
1aand Extended Data Fig.
1). With this set-up, we can perform single-shot electron spin readout20, and high fidelity (approximately 99.9%) single-shot quantum nondemolition readout of the nuclear spins21, as well as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and electron spin resonance (ESR)22on all spins involved (seeMethods).

b, Effective-mass calculation of the wavefunctionψ(y,z) of the third electron on the 2P cluster. The observed values of hyperfine coupling are well reproduced by assuming a 6.5-nm spacing between the donors.
c, Experimental NMR spectrum of the31P nuclei (top) and ESR spectrum of the shared electron (bottom) atB0= 1.33 T, along with energy level diagram (right) of the eight-dimensional Hilbert space (spacings not to scale). The spectra yield the hyperfine couplingsA1≈ 95 MHz andA2≈ 9 MHz between the electron and the nuclear qubits Q1 and Q2.
d, Implementation of a geometric two-qubit CZ gate. A conditional π phase shift is acquired when a 2π rotation is applied on the electron spin at frequency\({\nu }_{{\rm{e}}|\Downarrow \Downarrow }\), that is, conditional on the nuclear spins being\(|\Downarrow \Downarrow \rangle \). This operation corresponds to the CZ gate on the nuclei when restricted to the electron\(|\downarrow \rangle \)subspace, as indicated by the equivalence symbol (≅) between the two circuits.
Source dataThe ESR spectra in Fig.
1cexhibit four resonances. This means that the ESR frequency depends upon the state of two nuclei, to which the electron is coupled by contact hyperfine interactionsA1≈ 95 MHz andA2≈ 9 MHz, with a dependence on the gate potentials caused by the Stark shift (Extended Data Fig.
2). We adopt labels where, for instance,\({\nu }_{{\rm{e}}|\Downarrow \Downarrow }\)represents the frequency at which the electron spin undergoes transitions conditional on the two nuclear spin qubits being in the\(|{{\rm{Q}}}_{1}{{\rm{Q}}}_{2}\rangle =|\Downarrow \Downarrow \rangle \)state, and so on. The values ofA1,A2can be independently checked by measuring the frequenciesνQ1|↓,νQ2|↓at which each nucleus responds while the electron is in the\(|\downarrow \rangle \)state (Supplementary Information section 1).The hyperfine-coupled electron could either be the first or the third electron bound to the donor cluster. Since its spin relaxation timeT1eis three orders of magnitude shorter than expected from a one-electron system (Extended Data Fig.
3), we interpret the ESR spectrum in Fig.
1cas describing the response of the third electron bound to a 2P donor system.
An effective-mass calculation of the wavefunction of the third electron in a 2P system (seeMethods) reproduces the observed values ofA1andA2by assuming donors spaced 6.5 nm apart, and subjected to an electric field 2 mV nm−1that pulls the electron wavefunction more strongly towards donor 1 (Fig.
1b). The31P nuclei in this 2P cluster are spaced more widely than those produced by scanning probe lithography8,23, where the sub-nanometre inter-donor spacing causes a strongly anisotropic hyperfine coupling, which randomizes the nuclear spin state each time the electron is removed from the cluster for spin readout24. Here, instead, the probability of flipping a nuclear spin by electron ionization is of order 10−6(Extended Data Fig.
5), meaning that our nuclear readout is almost perfectly quantum nondemolition.
Nuclear two-qubit operationsWe first consider the two31P nuclear spins as the qubits of interest. One-qubit logic operations are trivially achieved by NMR pulses21(Methods and Extended Data Fig.
4), whereA1≠A2provides the spectral selectivity to address each qubit individually (Fig.
1c). Two-qubit operations are less trivial, since the nuclei are not directly coupled to each other (Supplementary Information sections1,9). They are, however, hyperfine-coupled to the same electron. This allows the implementation of a geometric two-qubit controlled-Z(CZ) gate4,16.
When a quantum two-level system is made to trace a closed trajectory on its Bloch sphere, its quantum state acquires a geometric phase equal to half the solid angle enclosed by the trajectory25. Figure1dillustrates how an electron 2π pulse at the frequency\({\nu }_{{\rm{e}}|\Downarrow \Downarrow }\)(see Fig.
1d) constitutes a nuclear CZ two-qubit gate. Starting from the state\(|\Downarrow \rangle \otimes (|\Downarrow \rangle +|\Uparrow \rangle )/\sqrt{2}\equiv (|\Downarrow \Downarrow \rangle +|\Downarrow \Uparrow \rangle )/\sqrt{2}\), the electronX2πpulse at\({\nu }_{{\rm{e}}|\Downarrow \Downarrow }\)introduces a phase factor eiπ= −1 to the\(|\Downarrow \Downarrow \rangle \)branch of the superposition, resulting in the state\((-|\Downarrow \Downarrow \rangle +|\Downarrow \Uparrow \rangle )/\sqrt{2}\equiv |\Downarrow \rangle \otimes (-|\Downarrow \rangle +|\Uparrow \rangle )/\sqrt{2}\), that is, a rotation of Q2 by 180 degrees around thezaxis of its Bloch sphere, which is the output of a CZ operation. Conversely, if the initial state of Q1 were\(|\Uparrow \rangle \), the pulse at\({\nu }_{{\rm{e}}|\Downarrow \Downarrow }\)would have no effect on the electron, leaving the nuclear qubits unaffected.
A nuclear controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate is obtained by sandwiching the CZ gate between a nuclear −π/2 and π/2 pulse (Extended Data Fig.
6a). Applying an ESRX2πpulse at\({\nu }_{{\rm{e}}|\Uparrow \Downarrow }\)transforms the sequence into a zero-CNOT gate, that is, a gate that flips Q2 when Q1 is in the\(|0\rangle \equiv |\Uparrow \rangle \)state (Extended Data Fig.
6band Supplementary Information section2).
We apply this universal gate set (Fig.
2a) to produce each of the four maximally entangled Bell states of the two nuclear spins,\(|{{\Phi }}^{\pm }\rangle =(|\Downarrow \Downarrow \rangle \pm |\Uparrow \Uparrow \rangle )/\sqrt{2}\)and\(|{{\Psi }}^{\pm }\rangle =(|\Downarrow \Uparrow \rangle \pm |\Uparrow \Downarrow \rangle )/\sqrt{2}\). We reconstruct the full density matrices of the Bell states using maximum likelihood quantum state tomography26(Supplementary Information section3). The reconstructed states (Fig.
2f) have fidelities of up to 94.2(2.7)%, and concurrences as high as 0.93(4), proving the creation of genuine two-qubit entanglement. Here and elsewhere, error bars indicate 1σconfidence intervals. Bell fidelities and concurrences are calculated without removing state preparation and measurement (SPAM) errors (Extended Data Table1).

Source dataGate set tomographyWe used a customized, efficient GST5,27,28analysis (seeMethods, Extended Data Figs.
7–9and Supplementary Information sections4,5,8) to investigate the quality of six logic operations on two nuclear-spin qubits:Xπ/2andYπ/2rotations on Q1 and Q2, an additionalY−π/2rotation on Q2, and the entangling CZ gate. No two single-qubit operations are ever performed in parallel. GST probes these six logic operations and reconstructs a full two-qubit model for their behaviour. Earlier experiments on electron spins in silicon used randomized benchmarking29,30to extract a single number for the average fidelity of all logic operations. Characterizing specific gates required ‘interleaved’ randomized benchmarking, which can suffer systematic errors31,32. Most importantly, randomized benchmarking does not reveal the cause or nature of the errors. Our GST method enables measuring each gate’s fidelity to high precision, distinguishing the contributions of stochastic and coherent errors, and separating local errors (on the target qubit) from crosstalk errors (on, or coupling to, the undriven spectator qubit).
GST estimates a two-qubit process matrix for each logic operation (Gi:i= 1, …, 6) using maximum likelihood estimation. We represent eachGias the composition of its ideal target unitary process (\({{\mathbb{G}}}_{i}\)) with an error process written in terms of a Lindbladian generator (\({{\mathbb{L}}}_{i}\)):\({G}_{i}={{\rm{e}}}^{{{\mathbb{L}}}_{i}}{{\mathbb{G}}}_{i}\). The error generator of each gate can be written as a linear combination of independent elementary error generators that describe distinct types of error33. Each elementary error generator’s coefficient in\({{\mathbb{L}}}_{i}\)is the rate (per gate) at which that error builds up. Any Markovian error process can be described using just four kinds of elementary error generators: Hamiltonian (H) errors, indexed by a single two-qubit Pauli operator, cause coherent or unitary errors (for example, HZZgenerates a coherentZZrotation); Pauli stochastic (S) errors, also indexed by a single Pauli operator, cause probabilistic Pauli errors (for example, SIXcauses probabilisticXerrors on Q2); Pauli correlation (C) errors; and active (A) errors, indexed by two Pauli operators, describe more exotic errors (seeMethods) that were not detected in this experiment. We found that the behaviour of each gate could be described using just 13–14 elementary error generators: three local S errors and three local H errors acting on each of Q1 and Q2, and 1–2 entangling H errors (discussed in detail below). Extended Data Fig.
8shows the rates of those errors, along with the process matrices and full error generators used to derive them. To get a higher-level picture of gate quality, we aggregate the rates of related errors (seeMethods) to report total rates of stochastic and coherent errors on each qubit and on the entire two-qubit system. We present two overall figures of merit in Fig.
3a, c: generator infidelity and total error. Generator infidelity is closely related to entanglement infidelity, which accurately predicts average gate performance in realistic large-scale quantum processors and can be compared to fault-tolerance thresholds (seeMethodsand Supplementary Information section9). Total error is related to diamond norm (see Supplementary Information section9) and estimates worst-case gate performance in any circuit, including structured or periodic circuits. In Fig.
3c, we additionally report the average gate fidelity of each gate on its target to ease comparison of these results with those from the literature.
Process matrices for all six gates were estimated using gate set tomography (GST) and represented as error generators with associated rates.
a, The total error rate of each gate (columns) can be partitioned into coherent (blue) and stochastic (orange) components, then further into components acting on Q1 (left), Q2 (right), and on both at once (wide). Coherent errors are further partitioned into intrinsic (dark) and relational (light), which were assigned to specific gates by fixing a gauge. The generator infidelity of each gate (see Supplementary Information section9) is shown, on the whole two-qubit system (hollow pins) and on its target qubit(s) only (black pins). The total infidelity of the CZ gate is only 0.79(14)%. Single-qubit gates have on-target infidelities of 0.07(3)–0.79(6)%, but display significant crosstalk errors of 0.47(5) – 2.63(8)% on the spectator qubit and unexpected entangling coherent (ZZ) errors.
b, An example process matrix is shown for the CZ gate.
c, Error metrics for each gate are aggregated by type (stochastic, coherent) and support (Q1, Q2, total). Uncertainties in parentheses represent 1σconfidence intervals. In addition to generator infidelity, each gate’s average gate fidelity on its target qubit(s) is shown, to facilitate comparison with literature.
d, A gauge-invariant representation of relational errors between gates (for example, misalignment of rotation axes) that were assigned to individual gates ina,cby fixing a gauge. Each gate is labelled with its intrinsic coherent (H) and stochastic (S) errors, and edges between two gates show the total amplitude of relational coherent error (misalignment) between them. Large gauge-invariant relational errors between single-qubit gates confirm that the entangling coherent errors observed inaare not an artefact of gauge-fixing.
Source dataThe process matrices estimated by GST are not unique. An equivalent representation of the gate set can be constructed by a gauge transformation5,34in which all process matrices are conjugated by some invertible matrix,Gi→MGiM−1. Some gate errors, such as over/under-rotations or errors on idle spectator qubits, are nearly unaffected by choice of gauge; they are intrinsic to that gate. But other errors, such as a tilted rotation axis, can be shifted from one gate to another by changing gauge. These relational errors cannot be objectively associated with any particular gate. Recognizing this, we divide coherent errors into intrinsic and relational components (Fig.
3a, c). Intrinsic errors perturb the eigenvalues of a gate, whereas relational errors perturb its eigenvectors. In Fig.
3a, cwe follow standard GST practice by choosing a gauge that makes the gates as close to their targets as possible. This associates relational errors with individual gates, in a way that depends critically on the choice of gauge. But the magnitude of a given relational error between a set of gates is gauge invariant, and Fig.
3dillustrates the total relational error between each pair of gates. In this work, we found evidence only for pairwise relational errors, although more complex multi-gate relational errors are possible.
All six gates achieved on-target fidelities greater than 99%, with infidelities as low as 0.07(3)% on Q1 and 0.68(7)% on Q2. However, we observed substantial crosstalk on the spectator qubit during one-qubit gates, resulting in full logic operations (one-qubit gate and spectator idle operation in parallel) with higher infidelities of 0.68(6)%−3.5(2)%. Remarkably, the infidelity of the CZ gate of 0.79(14)% is almost on par with the single-qubit gates—a rare scenario in multi-qubit systems (Fig.
3a, c).
SPAM errors were estimated by GST as 1.05(4)% on average, and as low as 0.25(3)% for the\(|\Uparrow \Uparrow \rangle \)state (Extended Data Table1). This is a unique feature of nuclear spin qubits, afforded by the quantum nondemolition nature of the measurement process21(Methods and Extended Data Fig.
5).
GST provided unambiguous evidence for a surprising relational error: weight-2 (entangling) HZZand/or\({{\rm{H}}}_{{{\mathbb{G}}}_{i}[ZZ]}\)coherent errors on each one-qubit gateGi, with amplitudes from 1.8–5.0% (Extended Data Fig.
8). These errors are consistent with an intermittentZZHamiltonian during the gate pulses. After ruling out a wide range of possible error channels, we propose that the observed HZZerror arises from the spurious accumulation of geometric phase by the electron spin, caused by off-resonance leakage of microwave power near the ESR frequencies (Supplementary Information section9). This observation illustrates the diagnostic power of GST, which revealed an error channel we had not anticipated. It also shows the ability of GST to unveil correlated and entangling errors, the detection and prevention of which is of key importance for the realization of fault-tolerant quantum computers35.
Three-qubit entanglementThe nuclear logic gates shown above would not scale beyond a single, highly localized cluster of donors. However, adding the hyperfine-coupled electron qubit yields a scalable heterogeneous architecture. Electron qubits decohere faster (see Extended Data Figs.
3, 4for a comparison), but admit faster control. If high-fidelity entanglement between electron and nuclear qubits can be created, electron qubits can enable fast coherent communication between distant nuclei (via electron–electron entanglement, or physical shuttling) or serve as high-fidelity ancilla qubits for quantum error correction. To demonstrate this capability, we produce the maximally entangled three-qubit Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger (GHZ) state\(|{\psi }_{{\rm{GHZ}}}\rangle =(|\Uparrow \Uparrow \uparrow \rangle +|\Downarrow \Downarrow \downarrow \rangle \rangle )/\sqrt{2}\)using the pulse sequence shown in Fig.
4a. Starting from\(|\Downarrow \Downarrow \downarrow \rangle \), an NMRYπ/2pulse atνQ2|↓creates a coherent superposition state of nucleus 2, followed by a nuclear zCNOT gate (as in Fig.
2a) to produce a nuclear |Φ+⟩state, and an ESRXπpulse at\({\nu }_{{\rm{e}}|\Downarrow \Downarrow }\)to arrive at |ψGHZ⟩. Since the ESR frequency directly depends on the state of both nuclei, the latter pulse constitutes a natural three-qubit Toffoli gate, making the creation of three-qubit entanglement particularly simple, as in nitrogen-vacancy centres in diamond36. Executing Toffoli gates on electrons in quantum dots37requires more complex protocols, but can be simplified by a combination of exchange and microwave pulses38.
a,b,Starting from\(|\Downarrow \Downarrow \downarrow \rangle \), the first three gates generate an entangled three-qubit GHZ state. All eight state populations are read out (b) at each circuit step (red dashed lines), and estimated without correcting for SPAM errors (Supplementary Information section7). The final three gatesR(θi)ϕreverse the operations of the first three if the rotation angles areθ1=θ2=θ3= 0, returning to the initial state in the absence of errors. The two gates that are conditional on Q2are composed of multiple pulses (Supplementary Information section6).
c, The coherence between the GHZ components\(|\Downarrow \Downarrow \downarrow \rangle \)and\(|\Uparrow \Uparrow \uparrow \rangle \)is probed by incrementing the phasesθiof the reversal pulses. This induces oscillations at frequencyf= 2π(θ1+θ2+θ3) the amplitude and phase of which correspond to the purity and phase relation between\(|\Downarrow \Downarrow \downarrow \rangle \)and\(|\Uparrow \Uparrow \uparrow \rangle \). Solid lines are the fitted sinusoidal curves.
d, Density-matrix extrema of the GHZ state. The state populations of the GHZ components\(|\Downarrow \Downarrow \downarrow \rangle \)and\(|\Uparrow \Uparrow \uparrow \rangle \)at circuit step 3 (b) provide the diagonal entries, and the oscillation amplitude and phase (c) provide the off-diagonal entries. From these values, the fidelity to the nearest GHZ state is estimated as 92.5(1.0)%, including SPAM.
Source dataMeasuring the populations of the eight electron–nuclear states (Supplementary Information section7) after each step confirms the expected evolution from\(|\Downarrow \Downarrow \downarrow \rangle \)to |ψGHZ⟩(Fig.
4b). The evolution can be undone by applying the sequence in reverse, yielding a return probability to\(|\Downarrow \Downarrow \downarrow \rangle \)of 89.6(9)%, including SPAM errors. As in the two-qubit case, measuring the populations is a useful sanity check but does not prove multipartite entanglement, which requires knowing the off-diagonal terms of the density matrixρGHZ= |ψGHZ⟩⟨ψGHZ|.
Standard tomography methods require measuring the target state in different bases, obtained by rotating the qubits prior to measurement. However, the superposition of\(|\Downarrow \Downarrow \downarrow \rangle \)and\(|\Uparrow \Uparrow \uparrow \rangle \)dephases at a rate dominated by the electron dephasing time\({T}_{2{\rm{e}}}^{\ast }\approx 100{\rm{\mu }}{\rm{s}}\)(Extended Data Fig.
3), which is only marginally longer than the nuclear spin operation time of approximately 10–20 μs. Therefore, the GHZ state will have dephased considerably by the time it is projected onto each measurement basis.
We circumvent this problem by adopting a tomography method that minimizes the time spent in the GHZ state. An extension of a method first introduced for the measurement of electron–nuclear entanglement in spin ensembles39, it is related to the parity scan commonly used in trapped ions40and superconducting circuits41. We repeat the reversal of the GHZ state (Fig.
4b)N= 100 times, each time introducing phase shiftsθ1,2,3to the rotation axes of the three reversal pulses, withθ1= 3θ2= 9θ3= 9N/125. The return probability to\(|\Downarrow \Downarrow \downarrow \rangle \)oscillates withN; the amplitude and phase of the oscillations yield the off-diagonal matrix element\(\langle \Downarrow \Downarrow \downarrow |{\rho }_{{\rm{GHZ}}}|\Uparrow \Uparrow \uparrow \rangle ={\rho }_{18}\).
Since the idealρGHZhas nonzero elements only on its four corners, the populationsρ11,ρ88and the coherenceρ18are sufficient to determine the GHZ state fidelityℱGHZ= 92.5(1.0)%. Also here, SPAM errors remain included in total infidelity. By comparison, an 88% GHZ state fidelity has been reported in a triple quantum dot after removing SPAM errors, whereas the uncorrected fidelity is 45.8%37. This highlights the drastic effect of SPAM of multi-qubit entanglement, and the robustness of our system against such errors. The different coherence and operation timescales for electron and nuclei need not be an obstacle for the use of such entangled states in scaled-up architectures, because all further entangling or shuttling operations between electrons will occur on approximately 1-μs time scales.
OutlookThe demonstration of one-qubit, two-qubit and SPAM errors at or below the 1% level highlight the potential of nuclear spins in silicon as a credible platform for fault-tolerant quantum computing. An often-quoted example, based on surface code quantum error correction, sets a fault-tolerance threshold of 0.56% for the entanglement infidelity of one- and two-qubit gates and the SPAM errors6.
Several avenues are available to harness the high-fidelity operations demonstrated here. Replacing the31P donors with the higher-spin group-V analogues such as123Sb (I= 7/2) or209Bi (I= 9/2) would provide access to a much larger Hilbert space in which to encode quantum information. For example, a cluster of two123Sb donors contains the equivalent of six qubits in the nuclear spins, plus an electron qubit. An error-correcting code can be efficiently implemented in high-spin nuclei42, where our method would provide a pathway for universal operations between the logical qubits encoded in each nucleus.
Moving to heavier group-V donors also enables the electrical control of the nuclear spins43. Combined with the electrical drive of the electron–nuclear ‘flip-flop’ transition44, this implies the ability to control electron and nuclei by purely electrical means. In a two-donor system as shown here, the entangling CZ gate could similarly be obtained by an electrical 2π pulse on a flip-flop transition.
The electron–nuclear entanglement we have demonstrated can be harnessed to scale up beyond a pair of nuclei coupled to the same electron. Neighbouring donor electrons can be entangled via exchange interaction by performing controlled-rotation resonant gates9or\(\sqrt{{\rm{SWAP}}}\)gates8. Wider distances could be afforded by physically shuttling the electron across lithographic quantum dots45,46, while preserving the quantum information encoded in it11. Our methods would apply equally to isoelectronic nuclear spin centres such as73Ge and29Si, where it has been shown that the nuclear qubit coherence is preserved while shuttling the electron across neighbouring dots10. Furthermore, electron spins can mediate the coherent interaction between nuclear spin qubits and microwave photons47,48. Recent experiments on electron spin qubits in silicon report one- and two-qubit gate fidelities above 99%49,50. Therefore, the fidelity of electron qubit operations will not constitute a bottleneck for the performance of electron–nuclear quantum processors. These examples illustrate the importance of universal high-fidelity two-qubit operations with nuclear spins in a platform such as silicon, which can simultaneously host nuclear and electron spin qubits, lithographic quantum dots and dense readout and control devices19.
MethodsDevice fabricationThe quantum processor is fabricated using methods compatible with standard silicon metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) processes. We start from a high-quality silicon substrate (p-type⟨100⟩; 10–20 Ω cm), on top of which a 900-nm-thick epilayer of isotopically enriched28Si has been grown using low-pressure chemical vapour deposition (LPCVD). The residual29Si concentration is 730 ppm. Heavily doped n+regions for ohmic contacts and lightly doped p regions for leakage prevention are defined by thermal diffusion of phosphorus and boron, respectively. A 200-nm-thick SiO2field oxide is grown in a wet oxidation furnace. In the centre of the device, an opening of 20 μm × 40 μm is etched in the field oxide using HF acid. Immediately after, an 8-nm-thick, high-quality dry SiO2gate oxide is grown in this opening. In preparation for ion implantation, a 90 nm × 100 nm aperture is opened in a PMMA mask using electron-beam lithography (EBL). The samples are implanted with P+ions at an acceleration voltage of 10 keV per ion. During implantation the samples were tilted by 8 degrees and the fluence was set at 1.4 × 1012cm−2. Donor activation and implantation damage repair is achieved through the process of a rapid thermal annealing (5 s at 1,000 °C). The gate layout is patterned around the implantation region in three EBL steps, each followed by aluminium thermal deposition (25 nm thickness for layer 1; 50 nm for layer 2; 100 nm for layer 3). Immediately after each metal deposition, the sample is exposed to a pure, low pressure (100 mtorr) oxygen atmosphere to form an Al2O3layer, which electrically insulated the overlapping metal gates. At the last step, samples are annealed in a forming gas (400 °C, 15 min, 95% N2/5% H2) aimed at passivating the interface traps.
Experimental set-upThe device was wire-bonded to a gold-plated printed circuit board and placed in a copper enclosure. The enclosure was placed in a permanent magnet array51, producing a static magnetic field of 1.33 T at the device (see Extended Data Fig.
1for field orientation). The board was mounted on a cryogen-free dilution refrigerator (Bluefors BF-LD400), reaching a base temperature of 14 mK, and the effective electron temperature was ~150 mK.
d.c. bias voltages were applied to all gates using voltage sources (Stanford Research Systems (SRS) SIM928). A room-temperature resistive combiner was used for the fast donor gates (Extended Data Fig.
1) to add d.c. voltages to a.c. signals produced by the LeCroy Arbstudio 1104, which then passed through an 80 MHz low-pass filter; all other gates passed through a 20 Hz low-pass filter. All filtering takes place at the mixing chamber plate. The wiring includes graphite-coated flexible coaxial cables to reduce triboelectric noise52.
Microwave pulses to induce ESR transitions were applied to an on-chip broadband antenna53using a vector microwave source (Rohde & Schwarz SGS100A) combined with an upconverter (SGU100A). The microwave carrier frequency remained fixed at 37.1004125 GHz, whereas the output frequency was varied within a pulse sequence by mixing it with a radio-frequency (RF) signal using double-sideband modulation, that is, by applying RF pulses to the in-phase port of the SGS100A IQ mixer (the quadrature port was terminated by a 50-Ω load). The carrier frequency was chosen such that whenever one sideband tone was resonant with an ESR pulse, the second sideband was off-resonant with all other ESR frequencies. To suppress microwave signals when not needed, 0 V was applied to the in-phase port of the IQ mixer. Under these circumstances, the carrier frequency is expected to be suppressed by 35 dB, according to the source data sheet. The RF pulses used for double-sideband modulation were generated by one of the two channels of the arbitrary waveform generator (Agilent 81180A); the second channel delivered RF pulses to the microwave antenna to drive NMR transitions. The microwave signal for ESR and RF signal for NMR were combined in a diplexer (Marki Microwave DPX-1721).
The SET current passed through a transimpedance amplifier (Femto DLPCA-200; 107V A−1gain, 50-kHz bandwidth), followed by a post-amplifier (SRS SIM910 JFET; 102V V−1gain), analogue filter (SRS SIM965; 50 kHz cut-off low-pass Bessel filter), and acquired via a PCI digitizer card (AlazarTech ATS9440). The instruments were triggered by a SpinCore PulseBlasterESR-PRO. The measurements instruments were controlled by Python code using the quantum measurement software packages QCoDeS and SilQ.
System HamiltonianThe static Hamiltonian of our combined electron-nuclei system iswhereγe≈ −27.97 GHz T−1is the electron gyromagnetic ratio54,γn≈ 17.23 MHz T−1is the nuclear gyromagnetic ratio55,\({\bf{S}}=[{\hat{S}}_{x},{\hat{S}}_{y},{\hat{S}}_{z}]\)are the electron spin operators, and\({{\bf{I}}}_{i}=[{\hat{I}}_{i,x},{\hat{I}}_{i,y},{\hat{I}}_{i,z}]\)are the nuclear spin operators for nucleusi∈1, 2. The static magnetic fieldB0= 1.33 T is aligned along\(\hat{z}\), andA1≈ 95 MHz (A2≈ 9 MHz) is the hyperfine interaction strength between the electron and nucleus 1 (2).
An a.c. drive applied to the microwave line is used to induce transitions between nuclear spin states and between electron spin states. The drive predominantly modulates the transverse magnetic field aswhereB1is the oscillating magnetic field strength, primarily aligned along\(\hat{y}\).
Electron spin readoutAn electron spin readout is realized through the spin-to-charge conversion56,57. This method utilizes a single-electron transistor (SET) as both a charge sensor and an electron reservoir. The electron spin\(|\downarrow \rangle \)and\(|\uparrow \rangle \)states are separated by the Zeeman energy, which scales linearly with the external magnetic field. Thermal broadening of the SET at 100 mK is much smaller than the Zeeman splitting of two electron spin states. This means that, at the read position, the donor electron spin-down state faces only occupied levels in the SET island (tunnelling is prohibited) and the spin-up state faces only unoccupied states and can freely tunnel out the SET island. This event will shift the energy ladder in the SET island, bringing it out of the Coulomb blockade, thus causing a burst in the current. This burst will last until\(|\downarrow \rangle \)electron tunnels to the donor. If the electron has been projected to the\(|\downarrow \rangle \)state then no change in the SET current will be recorded, as the electron cannot tunnel to the SET island. At the end of each read phase the electron spin is reinitialized in\(|\downarrow \rangle \)for the next single shot cycle. The fidelity of single-shot electron readout and\(|\downarrow \rangle \)initialization by spin-dependent tunnelling is ~80% in this device. However, we further increase the initialization fidelity by letting the electron thermalize to the lattice temperature for a time≫T1e(Fig.
3b) before triggering further operations.
Nuclear spin readout and initializationThe readout of the two nuclear spin qubits is an extension of the well known method developed for a single donor21, based on the excitation of the electron bound to the nuclei, conditional on a particular nuclear state, followed by electron spin readout20. The same method is used to initialize the nuclei in a known state.
In the present system, consisting of an electron coupled to two31P donors with different hyperfine couplingsA1≫A2, we find four well separated electron spin resonance (ESR) frequencies (Fig.
1c), conditional on the\(|\Downarrow \Downarrow \rangle \),\(|\Downarrow \Uparrow \rangle \),\(|\Uparrow \Downarrow \rangle \),\(|\Uparrow \Uparrow \rangle \)nuclear states. An electron in the\(|\downarrow \rangle \)state is initially drawn from a cold charge reservoir onto the donor cluster (independently of nuclear states). We then apply a microwave π pulse at a particular ESR frequency, for instance\({\nu }_{{\rm{e}}|\Downarrow \Downarrow }\)corresponding to the\(|\Downarrow \Downarrow \rangle \)nuclear spin state, and then measure the electron spin. If it is found in the\(|\uparrow \rangle \)state, then the nuclear spins are projected to the\(|\Downarrow \Downarrow \rangle \)state. If the electron is\(|\downarrow \rangle \)(that is, the pulse at\({\nu }_{{\rm{e}}|\Downarrow \Downarrow }\)failed to flip it to\(|\uparrow \rangle \)), the nuclear spins are projected to the subspace orthogonal to the\(|\Downarrow \Downarrow \rangle \)state. This constitutes a nuclear spins single-shot readout, with a fidelity given by the product of the electron single-shot readout fidelity (typically ~80%) and the electron π-pulse fidelity (≫99%).
This nuclear readout is a projective, approximately quantum nondemolition (QND) process21. The ideal QND measurement relies on the observableIzto commute with the HamiltonianHintdescribing an interaction between the observable and the measurement apparatus [Iz,Hint] = 0 (ref.
58). In our case the hyperfine termsA1SzIz1andA2SzIz2constituteHint. The observation of nuclear spin quantum jumps originating from the electron measurement by spin-dependent tunnelling (ionization shock) hints at a deviation from QND nature of the readout process21. It implies the presence of terms of the formA∥/S(S+I−+S−I+) in the hyperfine coupling, and possibly additional anisotropic terms, which do not commute withIz. In our experiment, the deviation from the ideal QND measurement is extremely small, of order 10−6, as shown in Extended Data Fig.
5.
We exploit the near-perfect QND nature of the nuclear spin readout by repeating the cycle (load |↓⟩–ESR π pulse–electron readout) between 7 and 40 times, to substantially increase the nuclear single-shot readout fidelity. This is the fundamental reason why our average SPAM errors are ~1% (Extended Data Table1), and we have thus reported Bell and GHZ state fidelities without removing SPAM errors from the estimate.
ESR and NMR calibrationGate calibrationBoth the one-qubit NMR gates and the two-qubit ESR gate were iteratively calibrated using a combination of GST and other tuning methods. Rabi flops were first used to obtain roughly calibrated one-qubit NMR gates. Next, one-qubit GST was repeatedly used to identify and correct error contributions such as over-/under-rotations and detunings. Other routines such as the repeated application of gates were performed in between GST measurements to independently verify the improvements to one-qubit gate fidelities of GST. The calibrated NMR π/2-pulse duration of Q1 (Q2) is 12.0 μs (25.3 μs). The discrepancy between the two durations is largely due to the hyperfine interaction enhancing the Rabi frequency of Q1 and reducing the Rabi frequency of Q2, combined with line reflections and filtering.
For the geometric two-qubit gate based upon an electron 2π pulse, we found that a trivial calibration using Rabi flops already gave a near-optimal result. GST was then used for fine-tuning and for the detection of small error contributions such as a minor frequency shift. The calibrated ESR 2π pulse duration of the CZ gate is 1.89 μs at an output power of 20 dBm.
Periodic frequency recalibrationTo keep the system tuned throughout the measurements, the NMR frequenciesνQ1|↓andνQ2|↓and ESR frequencyνe|↓↓were calibrated every ten circuits. The ESR frequency was calibrated by measuring the ESR spectrum and selecting the frequency of the ESR peak. The NMR frequencies were measured by a variant of the Ramsey sequence, consisting of anXπ/2andYπ/2separated by a wait timeτ. An off-resonant RF pulse was applied during the wait time to mitigate any frequency shift caused by the absence of an RF drive. Since nuclear readout has a near-unity fidelity, this measurement should result in a nuclear flipping probabilityPflip= 0.5 if the RF frequencyfRFmatches the average NMR frequencyfNMRthroughout the measurement. Therefore, any deviation ofPflipfrom 0.5 provides a direct estimate of the frequency mismatch Δf=fNMR−fRF= arcsin(2Pflip− 1)/(2πτ), provided that |Δf/τ| < 0.25. A higherτmore accurately estimates Δf, whereas a lowerτresults in the condition |Δf/τ| < 0.25 being valid for a broader range of Δf. The NMR recalibration sequence iteratively increased the wait timeτ= 40 μs → 100 μs → 160 μs to ensure that the condition |Δf/τ| < 0.25 remains satisfied while increasing the accuracy at which the NMR frequency is estimated. For eachτ, the NMR frequency was estimated by repeating this sequence and updating the RF frequency untilPflipfell within the range [0.4, 0.6].
Measurement overheadInstrument set-ups and calibration routines add a substantial overhead to the GST measurements. An estimate of this overhead can be obtained by comparing the total measurement duration to the duration of a single pulse sequence. The 2Q GST measurement shown in Fig.
3was acquired over 61 h, duSring which 300–503 shots were acquired for each of the 1,593 circuits. This results in an average duration of 340 ms per GST pulse sequence iteration. Compared to the average pulse sequence duration of around 121 ms, this corresponds to an overhead of 185%.
Effective-mass theory simulations of the hyperfine interactionTo simulate the wavefunction of the third electron in the 2P system, the effective-mass theory (EMT) model of the neutral 2P system in ref.
59. is extended in a mean-field approach.
For short donor separations, the two inner electrons are tightly bound in a magnetically inactive singlet orbital. The third electron then only interacts with the inner ones to the extent that it experiences the Coulomb repulsion of their fixed charge distributionHere,eis the electron charge,ϵSithe dielectric constant in silicon andρS(r′) is the charge density of the tightly bound electrons found in ref.
59The third electron is then effectively described by the sum of the 2P EMT Hamiltonian in an electric field59and the corresponding mean-field potential in equation (3).
Here, only 2P configurations along the [100] crystal axis with distancesd≤ 7 nm and realistic fieldsE≤ 2 mV nm−1are considered. In this regime the inter-donor exchange dominates the on-site exchange and the mean-field approach is justified.
The chosen basis is a combination of two STO-3G59orbitals, one variationally optimized atd= 0.5 nm and the other atd= 7 nm.
To compute the hyperfine interaction strength, the electron density at the nucleus is rescaled by a bunching factor of 440 (ref.
60). The experimentally found hyperfine configuration is found for donors spaced 6.5 nm apart, and subjected to an electric field 2 mV nm−1.
Gate set tomography experimentsWe designed a customized GST experiment for a set of six logic gates:Xπ/2andYπ/2rotations on each qubit, an additionalY−π/2rotation on Q2, and the symmetric CZ gate between them. A basic two-qubit GST experiment for this gate set comprises a list of quantum circuits defined by: (1) choosing a set of 75 short ‘germ’ circuits that, when repeated, collectively amplify every error rate; (2) repeating each germ several times to times to form ‘germ power’ circuits the lengths of which are approximatelyL= 1, 2, 4, …,Lmax; and (3) prefacing and appending each germ power with each of 16 ‘preparation fiducial’ circuits and each of 11 ‘measurement fiducial’ circuits. We usedLmax= 8, yielding a set of 20,606 circuits (this is not a simple multiplication because germ circuits with depth >1 do not appear at shorterL). We eliminated 92% of these circuits using two techniques from ref.
5. First, we identified a subset of 18 germs that amplify any dominant errors in each gate (ifLmaxwas very large, subdominant errors would get echoed away by dominant errors). This yielded a total of 50 germ powers. Second, for theL> 1 germ powers, we identified and eliminated pairs of fiducial circuits that provided redundant information. This trimmed the circuits per germ power from 176 to as few as 16, and the total number of circuits from 8,800 to just 1,592. Each of those circuits was repeated 300–500 times to gather statistics. We used maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) implemented in the pyGSTi software61,62to estimate 16 × 16 two-qubit process matrices {Gi:i= 1, …, 6} for all six operations.
Constructing and selecting reduced modelsProcess matrices are a comprehensive, but not especially transparent, representation of gate errors. So we used each gate’s ideal target (unitary) operation\({{\mathbb{G}}}_{i}\)to construct an error generator33\({{\mathbb{L}}}_{i}=\,\log ({G}_{i}{{\mathbb{G}}}_{i}^{-1})\)that presents the same information more usefully. Representing noisy gates this way enables us to split each gate’s total error into parts that act on Q1 only, Q2 only, or both qubits together—and then further into coherent and stochastic errors—to reveal those errors’ sources and consequences. It also enables the construction of simple, efficient ‘reduced models’ for gate errors, by identifying swaths of elementary error generators whose rates are indistinguishable from zero.
Pinning the coefficients ofkelementary error generators to zero yields a reduced model withkfewer parameters, whose likelihood (ℒ) can be found by MLE. We evaluate the statistical significance of error rates that were pinned by seeing how muchℒdeclines. If a given error’s true rate is zero, then pinning it to zero in the model reduces 2logℒ, on average, by 1 (ref.
63). So when we pinkrates, we compute the ‘evidence ratio’r= 2Δlogℒ/k, where Δlogℒis the difference between the two models’ likelihood64. Ifr≤ 1, the pinned rates are strictly negligible; ifr≤ 2, then the smaller model is preferred by Akaike’s information criterion (AIC);65other criteria (for example, the Bayesian BIC) impose higher thresholds. We used a slightly higher threshold and chose the smaller model wheneverr≤ 5. Using this methodology, we constructed a model that describes the data well, in which just 83 (out of 1,440) elementary errors’ rates are nonzero.
The rates of all the un-pinned elementary errors form a vector describing the noisy model. In general, un-physical gauge degrees of freedom5will give rise to a foliation of the model space into gauge manifolds on which the log-likelihood is constant. In our analysis, we work in the limit of small errors and gauge transformations where the space is approximately linear, and identify the subspace that is gauge invariant. We are able to construct a basis for the gauge-invariant subspace whose elements correspond to relational or intrinsic errors and have a definite type (H, S or A), allowing us to decompose the model’s total error as shown in Fig.
3.
Extended Data Fig.
8presents each gate’s 13–14 nonzero elementary error rates after projecting the error vector onto the gauge-invariant subspace (column 3), along with the process matrices (column 1) and error generators (column 2) from which they are derived. Here and elsewhere, error bars are 1σconfidence intervals computed using the Hessian of the log-likelihood function.
Aggregated error rates and metricsOur GST analysis aims to identify specific gate errors and understand how these errors affect the overall performance of our system. It begins with the raw output of GST—rates of elementary errors on gates. We aggregate these error rates in different ways, yielding each gate’s total error and infidelity, and partitioning those metrics into their components on Q1 or Q2 or both qubits together, in order to summarize different aspects of system performance. We additionally report average gate fidelities to facilitate comparison with the literature.
Gate errors, by definition, cause unintended changes in the state of the system. S error generators produce stochastic errors that transfer probability to erroneous states; H generators produce coherent errors that transfer amplitude to erroneous states. We can interpret the rate of an error generator, to first order, as the amount of erroneous probability (denotedϵfor S generators) or amplitude (denotedθfor H generators) transferred by a single use of the gate when acting on one half of a maximally entangled state.
It is useful to group similar errors together and aggregate their rates. We classify and combine error generators according to:Their type (H or S),Their support (Q1, Q2 or joint),Whether they are intrinsic to a single gate, or relational between gates (H errors only; relational S errors were negligible).
The elementary error generators described in the main text have definite type and support. For example, the HXIgenerator has type H and support on Q1. Any error generator on a given gate is intrinsic to that gate if it commutes with the gate, and relational otherwise. For example, if single-qubitXπ/2andYπ/2gates produce rotations around axes that are separated by only 89° instead of 90°, then either gate can be considered perfect at the cost of assigning a 1° tilt error to the other gate. This error can be moved between the two gates by a gauge transformationMthat rotates both gates by 1° around theZ-axis. This error is purely relational; it cannot be assigned definitively to one gate or the other, but can be unambiguously observed in circuits containing both gates.
To divide each gate’s errors into intrinsic and relational components, we represent the gate’s error generator as a vector in a space spanned by the H and S elementary error generators. Error generators that commute with the target gate form a subspace that is invariant under gauge transformations. The error generator’s projection onto this space is its intrinsic component. Error generators in the complement of the intrinsic subspace are relational—they can be changed or eliminated by gauge transformations—and the projection of the gate’s error generator onto this complement is its relational component.
To construct aggregated error metrics, we start by aggregating H and S rates separately. They add in different ways, because H error rates correspond to amplitudes whereas S error rates correspond to probabilities. Rates of S generators add directly (ϵagg= ∑iϵi), whereas rates of H generators add in quadrature (\({\theta }_{{\rm{agg}}}={({\sum }_{i}{\theta }_{i}^{2})}^{1/2}\)). Combining H and S error rates into a single metric is trickier—there is no unique way to do so because the impact of coherent errors depends on how they interfere over the course of a circuit. We therefore consider two quantities: total error,ϵtot=ϵagg+θagg, and generator infidelity,\(\hat{{\epsilon }}={{\epsilon }}_{{\rm{agg}}}+{\theta }_{{\rm{agg}}}^{2}.\)Total error approximates the maximal rate at which gate errors could add up in any circuit, whereas infidelity quantifies the same errors’ average impact in a random circuit.
Both of these metrics appear in Fig.
3, where in Fig.
3a, b, dwe report aggregated error rates that partition the overall error in various ways (see the discussion in Supplementary Information section 10). We report a third metric, the average gate fidelity (AGF) on each gate’s target qubit(s), in Fig.
3cand in the Abstract to aid comparison with other published results. The on-target AGF provides an overall (and gauge-dependent) measure of the average performance of a gate when acting only on the target qubit(s). For a gate targeting Q1, it is defined as:For a two-qubit gate, the on-target AGF is simply the AGF of the two-qubit operation:In both cases, dψis the Haar measure (over one-qubit states in equation (4) and over two-qubit states in equation (5)) and\({\mathbb{L}}\)is the error generator of the gate. Although AGF is provided for comparison to the literature, it is not a good predictor of performance in general circuits (see Supplementary Information section9), and when we use the unqualified term ‘fidelity’, it always denotes generator fidelity,\(\hat{{\epsilon }}\). Supplementary Information section9includes an extensive discussion of overall gate error metrics and their relationships.

Extended data figures and tablesExtended Data Fig. 1 Device layout.
Scanning electron micrograph of a device identical to the one used in this experiment.
31P donor atoms are implanted in the region marked by the orange rectangle, using a fluence of 1.4 × 1012cm−2which results in a most probable inter-donor spacing of approximately 8 nm. Four metallic gates are fabricated around the implantation region, and used to modify the electrochemical potential of the donors. A nearby SET, formed using the SET top gate and barrier gates, enables charge sensing of a single donor atom, as well as its electron spin through spin-to-charge conversion (Methods). The tunnel coupling between the donors and SET is tuned by the rate gate situated between the SET and donor implant region. A nearby microwave (MW) antenna is used for ESR and NMR of the donor electron and nuclear spins, respectively.
Extended Data Fig. 2 Electrical tunability of the hyperfine interaction and the electron gyromagnetic ratio.
a, Map of the SET current as a function of SET gate and fast donor gates (pulsed jointly). The white dashed line indicates the location in gate space where the 2P donor cluster changes its charge state. The third, hyperfine-coupled electron is present on the cluster in the region to the right of the line. Electron spin readout is performed at the location indicated by the pink star.
b, ESR spectrum of the electron bound to the 2P cluster, acquired while the system was tuned within the blue dashed rectangle ina. The hyperfine couplingsA1,A2are extracted from ESR frequencies as shown, namely\({A}_{1}=({\nu }_{{\rm{e}}|\Uparrow \Downarrow }+{\nu }_{{\rm{e}}|\Uparrow \Uparrow })/2-({\nu }_{{\rm{e}}|\Downarrow \Downarrow }+{\nu }_{{\rm{e}}|\Downarrow \Uparrow })/2\);\({A}_{2}={\nu }_{{\rm{e}}|\Uparrow \Uparrow }-{\nu }_{{\rm{e}}|\Uparrow \Downarrow }\).
c,d, Extracted hyperfine couplings within the marked area. The data show thatA1decreases andA2increases upon moving the operation point towards higher gate voltages and away from the donor readout position.
e, A small change is also observed in the sum of the two hyperfine interactionsAt=A1+A2.
f, Electrical modulation (Stark shift) of the electron gyromagnetic ratioγe, extracted from the shift of the average of the hyperfine-split electron resonances. The ESR frequencies can be tuned with fast donor gates at the rate of\(\Delta {\nu }_{{\rm{e}}|\Uparrow \Uparrow }=0.3{{\rm{MHzV}}}^{-1}\);\(\Delta {\nu }_{{\rm{e}}|\Uparrow \Downarrow }=5.2{{\rm{MHzV}}}^{-1}\);\(\Delta {\nu }_{{\rm{e}}|\Downarrow \Uparrow }=7.6{{\rm{MHzV}}}^{-1}\);\(\Delta {\nu }_{{\rm{e}}|\Downarrow \Downarrow }=2.4{{\rm{MHzV}}}^{-1}\).
Extended Data Fig. 3 Coherence metrics of the electron spin qubit.
The columns correspond to the nuclear configurations\(|\Downarrow \Downarrow \rangle \),\(|\Downarrow \Uparrow \rangle \),\(|\Uparrow \Downarrow \rangle \),\(|\Uparrow \Uparrow \rangle \), respectively. All measurements start with the electron spin initialized in the\(|\downarrow \rangle \)state. Error bars are 1σconfidence intervals.
a, Electron Rabi oscillations. The measurements were performed by applying a resonant ESR pulse of increasing duration. The different Rabi frequenciesfRabion each resonance are probably due to a frequency-dependent response of the on-chip antenna and the cable connected to it.
b, Electron spin-lattice relaxation timesT1e. Measurements were obtained by first adiabatically inverting the electron spin to\(|\uparrow \rangle \), followed by a varying wait timeτbefore electron readout. The observed relaxation times are nearly three orders of magnitude shorter than typically observed in single-electron, single-donor devices66, and even shorter compared to 1e–2P clusters. This strongly suggests that the measured electron is the third one, on top of two more tightly-bound electrons which form a singlet spin state67. We also observe a strong dependence ofT1eon nuclear spin configuration.
c, Electron dephasing times\({T}_{2{\rm{e}}}^{\ast }\). The measurements were conducted by performing a Ramsey experiment—that is, by applying two π/2 pulses separated by a varying wait timeτ, followed by electron readout. The Ramsey fringes are fitted to a function of the form\({P}_{\uparrow }(\tau )={C}_{0}+{C}_{1}\,\cos (\Delta \omega \tau +\Delta \phi )\exp [-{(\tau /{T}_{2e}^{\ast })}^{2}]\), where Δωis the frequency detuning and Δϕis a phase offset. The observed\({T}_{2{\rm{e}}}^{\ast }\)times are comparable to previous values for electrons coupled to a single31P nucleus.
d, Electron Hahn-echo coherence times\({T}_{2{\rm{e}}}^{{\rm{H}}}\), obtained by adding a π refocusing pulse to the Ramsey sequence. We also varied the phase of the final π/2 pulse at a rate of one period perτ= (5 kHz)−1, to introduce oscillations in the spin-up fraction which help improve the fitting. The curves are fitted to the same function used to fit the Ramsey fringes, with fixed Δω= 5 kHz. The measured\({T}_{2{\rm{e}}}^{{\rm{H}}}\)times are similar to previous observations for electrons coupled to a single31P nucleus.
Extended Data Fig. 4 Nuclear spin coherence times.
Panels in column 1 (2) correspond to nucleus Q1 (Q2). Error bars are 1σconfidence intervals.
a, Nuclear dephasing times\({T}_{2{\rm{n}}}^{\ast }\), obtained from a Ramsey experiment. Results are fitted with a decaying sinusoid with fixed exponent factor 2 (see Extended Data Fig.
3).
b, Nuclear Hahn-echo coherence times\({T}_{2{\rm{n}}}^{{\rm{H}}}\). To improve fitting, oscillations are induced by incrementing the phase of the final π/2 pulse withτat a rate of one period per (3.5 kHz)−1. Results are fitted with a decaying sinusoid with fixed exponent factor 2 (see Extended Data Fig.
3).
c, Dependence of\({T}_{2{\rm{n}}}^{{\rm{H}}}\)on the amplitude of an off-resonance pulse. We perform this experiment to study whether a qubit, nominally left idle (or, in quantum information terms, subjected to an identity gate) is affected by the application of an RF pulse to the other qubit, at a vastly different frequency. Here, during the idle times between NMR pulses, an RF pulse is applied at a fixed frequency 20 MHz—far off resonance from both qubits’ transitions—with varying amplitudeVRF. The red dashed line indicates the applied RF amplitude for NMR pulses throughout the experiment. We observe a slow decrease of\({T}_{2{\rm{n}}}^{{\rm{H}}}\)with increasingVRF. This is qualitatively consistent with the observation of large stochastic errors on the idle qubit, as extracted by the GST analysis in Fig.
3.
Extended Data Fig. 5 Nuclear spin quantum jumps caused by ionization shock.
The electron and nuclear spin readout relies upon spin-dependent charge tunnelling between the donors and the SET island. If the electron tunnels out of the two-donor system, the hyperfine interactionsA1,A2suddenly drop to zero. IfA1andA2include an anisotropic component (for example, due to the non-spherical shape of the electron wavefunction which results in nonzero dipolar fields at the nuclei), the ionization is accompanied by a sudden change in the nuclear spin quantization axes (‘ionization shock’), and can result in a flip of the nuclear spin state. We measure the nuclear spin flips caused by ionization shock by forcibly loading and unloading an electron from the 2P cluster every 0.8 ms.
a, For qubit 1 withA1= 95 MHz, the flip rate is\({{\Gamma }}_{1}=2.8\times {10}^{-6}\frac{{N}_{{\rm{flip}}}}{{N}_{{\rm{ion}}}}\).
b, For qubit 2 withA2= 9 MHz, the flip rate is\({{\Gamma }}_{2}=4.0\times {10}^{-7}\frac{{N}_{{\rm{flip}}}}{{N}_{{\rm{ion}}}}\). This means that the nuclear spin readout via the electron ancilla is almost exactly quantum nondemolition. From this data, we also extract an average time between random nuclear spin flips of 283 seconds for qubit 1, and 2,000 seconds for qubit 2. The extremely low values ofΓ—comparable to those observed in single-donor systems—are the reason why we can reliably operate the two31P nuclei as high-fidelity qubits.
Extended Data Fig. 6 CNOT and zero-CNOT nuclear two-qubit gates.
We perform Rabi oscillation on the control qubit followed by the application ofa, zCNOT orb, CNOT gates. The two qubits are initialized in the\(|\Downarrow \Downarrow \rangle \equiv |11\rangle \)state. We observe the Rabi oscillations of both qubits in phase for zCNOT and out of phase for CNOT. At every odd multiple of π/2 rotation of the control qubit the Bell states are created.
Extended Data Fig. 7 Two-qubit GST.
a, Measurement circuit for the two-qubit GST. A modified version of this circuit has been used for Bell state tomography. The green box prepares the qubit 2 in the\(|\Uparrow \rangle \)state, then the orange box prepares the qubit 1 in the\(|\Uparrow \rangle \)state. The readout step in the blue box (seeMethods) determines whether the\(|\Downarrow \Downarrow \rangle \)state initialization was successful. Only then the record will be saved. The electron spin is prepared in\(|\downarrow \rangle \)during the nuclear spin readout process. Subsequently, the GST sequence is executed. The red box indicates the Q1, Q2 readout step. The total duration of the pulse sequence is 120 ms, of which nuclear spin initialization is 8.6 ms (green and yellow), initial nuclear spin readout is 26.5 ms (blue), 3 ms delay is added for electron initialization (between blue and purple), GST circuit is 10 μs–300 μs (purple), and nuclear readout is 80 ms (orange).
b, Measurement results for individual two-qubit GST circuit. The first 145 circuits estimate the preparation and measurement fiducials, and the subsequent circuits are ordered by increasing circuit depth. At the end of a circuit, there are three situations for the target state populations: 1) the population is entirely in one state, while all others are zero; 2) the population is equally spread over two states, while the other two are zero; 3) the population is equally spread over all four states. The measured state populations for the different circuits therefore congregate around the four bands 0, 0.25, 0.5, and 1, as indicated by black dashed lines.
Extended Data Fig. 8 Estimated gate set, from process matrices to error rates.
Experimental GST data were analysed using pyGSTi to obtain self-consistent maximum likelihood estimates of two-qubit process matrices for all six elementary gates. These are represented (‘Process Matrix’ column) in a gauge that minimizes their average total error, as superoperators in the two-qubit Pauli basis. Green columns indicate positive matrix elements, orange ones are negative. Wireframe sections indicate differences between estimated and ideal (target) process matrices. Those process matrices can be transformed to error generators (‘Error Generator’ column) that isolate those differences, and are zero if the estimated gate equals its target. Each gate’s error generator was decomposed into a sparse sum of Hamiltonian and stochastic elementary error generators33. Those rates are depicted (‘All Error Rates’ column) as contributions to the gate’s total error, with 1σuncertainties indicated in parentheses. Each non-vanishing elementary error rate (error generators are denoted ‘H’ or ‘S’ followed by a Pauli operator) is listed, and identified with its role in the total error budget (reproduced from Fig.
3). Orange bars indicate stochastic errors, dark blue indicate coherent errors that are intrinsic to the gate, and light blue indicate relational coherent errors that were assigned to this gate. Total height of the blue region indicates the total coherent error, but because coherent error amplitudes add in quadrature, individual components’ heights are proportional to their quadrature.
Extended Data Fig. 9 Simulation of standard and interleaved randomized benchmarking.
All simulated randomized benchmarking experiments used two-qubit Clifford subroutines compiled from the six native gates, requiring (on average) 14.58 individual gate operations per two-qubit Clifford.
a, Standard randomized benchmarking, simulated using the GST-estimated gate set, yields a ‘reference’ decay rate ofrr= 22.2(2)%, suggesting an average per-gate error rate ofrr/14.58 ≈ 1.5%. 1σconfidence intervals are indicated in parentheses.
b–f, Simulated interleaved randomized benchmarking for the CZ gate, and one-qubitXπ/2andYπ/2gates on each qubit, yielded interleaved decay ratesrr+ri. For each experiment, 1,000 random Clifford sequences were generated, at each of 15 circuit depths m, and simulated using the GST process matrices. Exact probabilities (effectively infinitely many shots of each sequence) were recorded. Inset histograms show the distribution over 1000 random circuits atm= 4. Observed decays are consistent with each gate’s GST-estimated infidelities—for example, 1 −F= 0.79% for the CZ gate (b). Performing these exact randomized benchmarking experiments in the lab would have required running 90,000 circuits to estimate a single parameter (ri) for each gate to the given precision of ±0.25%. Using fewer (<1,000) random circuits at eachmwould yield lower precision. GST required only 1,500 circuits to estimate all error rates to the same precision.
