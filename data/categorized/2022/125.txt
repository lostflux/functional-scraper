This gap begins in education, fueled by gender stereotypes and expectations regarding “women’s work.” 1 Systems of bias that push women and people of color out of STEM careers can also influence the products and services created by STEM organizations, such as artificial intelligence (AI).
2 Organizational strategies to recruit, retain, and advance women in STEM occupations can help address these issues.
GLOBAL Men Continue to Dominate the STEM Workforce Globally, Especially at the Highest Levels When compared to other industries (including non-STEM), the representation of women among board directors in the information technology industry remains low but continues to increase, reaching 28% in 2021, up from 21% in 2020.
3 Despite Improvements at the Board Level, the Technology Industry Still Lacks Women in Senior Leadership 4 Out of the CS Gender 3000 companies, women globally account for only 17% of managers in the information technology industry.
5 In 2019, women were only 3% of CEOs.
6 Women were only around 21.0-22.0% of CFOs in information technology in 2021, although this is a higher percentage compared to other major industries.
7 Cultural Expectations and Stereotypes Can Affect Women’s Participation in STEM A UNESCO research review across eight Asian countries found a number of common sociocultural norms that can prevent women from pursuing STEM education or careers. These included: 8 A perception that STEM is an “inappropriate” choice for women and associated as a male subject.
Expectations of domestic responsibilities, such as family care.
Unreliable support structures and a lack of mobility.
CANADA Women in Canada Are Less Likely to Enter and More Likely to Leave STEM Fields 9 In 2019, women earned approximately one-third (36.4%) of all recipients of STEM postsecondary degrees in Canada.
10 Among students earning bachelor’s degrees in 2019, women represented: 11 All STEM subjects: 41.8% Science and science technology: 61.0% Engineering and engineering technology: 21.7% Mathematics and computer and information sciences: 31.4% In 2021, women accounted for less than a quarter (23.5%) of those working in natural and applied sciences and related occupations.
12 In these occupations, women earned, on average, $0.84 to every $1.00 earned by men in annual wages, salaries, and commissions in 2020.
13 EUROPE Women in Europe Are Closing the Gender Gap in Science and Engineering 14 In 2021, women made up more than a third (40.7%) of scientists and engineers in the EU-27, a slight increase from 38.7% in 2011.
15 High-tech remains male dominated.
In 2021, women were just 32.8% of those employed in high-tech manufacturing and knowledge-intensive high-tech services in the EU-27.
16 And Europe’s gender gap in STEM is especially wide in information and communication technologies in higher education as well: Women’s Share of Bachelor’s Degrees in STEM Fields, 2020 17 Country Natural Sciences, Mathematics and Statistics Information and Communication Technologies Engineering, Manufacturing and Construction European Union (EU-27) 54.9% 20.7% 25.5% France 53.3% 17.3% 26.0% Germany 48.3% 20.8% 17.8% Netherlands 47.9% 12.1% 22.8% Switzerland 45.5% 10.6% 15.4% Similar gaps exist among UK undergraduates.
 Despite making up over half of all undergraduates (56.8%) as well as 52.8% of undergraduates in all science fields in 2020-21, women are only 18.6% of students enrolled in engineering and technology and only 17.7% of students studying computing.
18 Despite increases over the past decade, as of 2021 women still make up only 16.5% of engineers in the UK.
19 Women are also more likely than men to work in related professional roles, rather than “core” engineering work.

22 Women with bachelor’s degrees and higher largely contribute to this proportion, making up 44% of the STEM workforce.
23 A substantial gender gap in engineering (16% women) and computer occupations (26% women) also contributes to women’s overall underrepresentation in STEM.
24 Few science and engi neerin g employees in the United States were women of color (11.6%) in 2019, including: 25 Asian women: 6.5% Black women: 1.8% Latinas: 2.4% American Indian/Alaska Native women: 0.1% The share of STEM degrees is also small for women of color in the United States.
In 2019–2020, women of color earned a small percentage (15.1%) of bachelor’s degrees across all STEM fields, including: 26 Asian women: 5.5% Black women: 3.0% Latinas: 4.8% American Indian/Alaska Native women: 0.1% Women Working in STEM Earn Less Than Men Across All Racial and Ethnic Groups 27 When typical STEM earnings are compared across race/ethnicity and gender, Black women and Latinas earn the least.

There is no standard definition of a STEM occupation. For the purposes of this Quick Take, STEM incorporates professional and technical support occupations in the areas of life and physical sciences, computer science and mathematics, and engineering. Less agreement has been made on the inclusion of educators, healthcare professionals, and social scientists in STEM; therefore, these occupations are not covered here.
