This works for streets, sidewalks and parking lots.
When drivers and passengers open a vehicle door from the inside to exit the vehicle, they should use their far hand (the hand farthest from the door) to open the door. As you reach across your body to the door handle, your body will naturally swivel, and you will automatically look at the side-view mirror and look back for oncoming bikes and traffic. Open the door slowly and remain vigilant.
Retired physician Michael Charney has spent nearly three years teaching people thefar hand reach, also known as the Dutch Reach.
