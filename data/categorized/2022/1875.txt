Oxford University Press'sAcademic Insights for the Thinking WorldThe possibility of a world without intimate violenceBy Anne P. DePrinceThe French presidential election: Macron’s strange victory [long read]By Emile Chabal, Michael C. Behrent, and Marion Van RenterghemBeyond the Anna Karenina principle in economic developmentBy Oscar Calvo-GonzalezA long look at the origin of idiomsBy Anatoly LibermanIdioms are a thankful subject: one needs no etymological algebra or linguistic preparation for suggesting the origin of phrases. And yet it may be useful to explain how a professional goes about studying idioms.
A Florence Price mystery solved (part two)By Douglas W. ShadleTo my knowledge, Price’s Boston address remained inconclusive until I visited Special Collections at the University of Arkansas Mullins Library this past January to find new leads for the Price biography I am co-authoring with Samantha Ege, the Lord Crewe Junior Research Fellow in Music at Lincoln College, Oxford. The recovery of this information fills a void in a life story for which “the necessary evidence to write a detailed biography,” as preeminent Price scholar Rae Linda Brown once put it, “is surprisingly scant.”Five ways to support international students studying in the UKBy Polly PenterGoing to university for the first time, or embarking on graduate study, is a significant transition for anyone. Doing it in an unfamiliar country, with no support network, unaccustomed to the idiosyncrasies of the daily life and daunted by an alien academic culture, can be overwhelming—and that’s before we even consider that students may be doing all this in a second language!The curious popularity of “however” in research articlesBy David H. FosterThere are many ways to signal a change of direction in a piece of text, but the most common is by inserting a “but.” Alternatives such as “although,” “though,” “however,” “yet,” and “nevertheless” generally run a poor second. In research articles, though, the prevalence of “however” increases—especially in some disciplines.
The sour milk of etymologyBy Anatoly LibermanThe time has come to write something about the etymology of the word milk. Don’t hold your breath: “origin unknown,” that is, no one can say why milk is called milk, but then no one can say why water is called water either.

Regardless of attempts—real or professed—at limiting civilian casualties, military conflict always unleashes suffering on the civilian population. History also shows us that the disruptive effect of war also runs deeper and far beyond the geographic limits of fighting with far-reaching consequences for sustainability.
A literary history of Modernism [timeline]By Ashendri WickremasingheIn this timeline, we explore key figures and events that contributed to shaping modernism and celebrate 100 years since 1922: the pinnacle year of modernist publishing!Renewable solar energy: how does it work and can it meet demand?By Paul F. MeierWhile it is impractical to have solar panels dotting virtually every available surface of the earth, it does show the awesome potential of solar energy as a renewable energy to meet our needs for generations to come.
We are what we breathe: environmental factors in biological ageingBy Yanfei Guo and Fan WuVolcanic eruptions, floods, and heatwaves have forced us to think seriously about whether the air we breathe will allow us to age healthily. To try to answer this question, we selected a unique sample of five middle-income countries on four continents and used NASA satellite remote sensing data to assess the associations between long-term exposure to ambient PM2.5 and frailty in older populations.
Social work in the anti-science era: how to build trust in science-based practiceBy Lisa Rapp-McCallOver the past five to seven years, there has been an increase in anti-science rhetoric and ideas which look to replace the reliance on science with misleading theories and discredit scientific experts. Unfortunately, non-scientific beliefs gained traction during the pandemic and show no signs of slowing. This post-truth and anti-science movement places the field of social work at an important crossroads.
How avocados may boost dog health [infographic]By Madeline McCurry-SchmidtIn a new Journal of Animal Science study, researchers at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign report that dogs can benefit from fiber in their diet, which can help with weight loss and supports beneficial bacteria.
On being lazy, loose, empty, and idleBy Anatoly LibermanSome of the most common words appeared in English late. Yet their origin is obscure. Of course, while dealing with old words, we also encounter unexpected solutions.
The role of DNA research in society [podcast]By Steven Filippi and Stella EdisonFor today’s episode of The Oxford Comment, we’re commemorating National DNA Day in the United States with Amber Hartman Scholz and Dee Denver.
Rough Walkers: the true story of Roosevelt’s Rough RidersBy J. Ray Fisher and Robert N. WiedenmannThe recent controversy over a statue of Theodore Roosevelt reveals a larger story: one about the Rough Riders, the first United States Volunteer Cavalry. Although their victory at the Battle for the San Juan Heights is well-known, the Riders’ real enemy was not the Spanish they fought but the deadly yellow fever and malaria carried by mosquitoes.
The problem with self-driving cars is not technology, the problem is peopleBy D. Christopher KayesThe recent $2.5 billion fine against Boeing due to the 737 Max disaster exposes a problem associated with the introduction of new technology. This blog post highlights how the successful adoption of self-driving cars will depend on the drivers, not just on the technology.
