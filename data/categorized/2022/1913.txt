Time.comMAGAZINEMay 23rd, 2022 | Vol. 199, No. 19 | South AmericaBrazil’s Most Popular President Returns From Political Exile With a Promise to Save the Nation'I never gave up,' Brazil's former leader tells TIME as he launches a new bid for the presidencyThe genre we assign to a life story depends a lot on how it ends. Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva’s life has already completed several dramatic arcs. First, the hero’s journey: a child born into poverty moves to the big city, rises to lead a labor union, and then becomes the most popular President in the history of modern Brazil. Then the tragedy: a celebrated statesman is fingered in a staggering corruption scheme, sent to prison, and forced to watch from the sidelines while rivals dismantle his legacy.
The endings don’t seem to stick, though. In April 2021, Brazil’s Supreme Court annulled the corruption convictions that had excluded Lula—as he’s universally known—from politics in 2018,sayinga biased judge on his case had compromised his right to a fair trial. The bombshell decisionset Brazil on course for a showdownbetween the leftist Lula and current far-right President Jair Bolsonaro in the October 2022 elections. Pollsnow putthe challenger at 45% and the incumbent at 31%, with more centrist candidates all but out of the running.

But he didn’t hesitate to return to frontline politics. “In truth, I never gave up,” he rumbles in his famously gravelly voice, made hoarser by age. “Politics lives in every cell of my body, because I have a cause. And in the 12 years since I left office, I see that all the policies I created to benefit the poor have been destroyed.”Buy a Print of TIME’s Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva CoverIt’s late March, six weeks before Lula launches his campaign, and he’s sitting in a studio in the São Paulo headquarters of his Workers’ Party (PT). Chuckling and griping that no one knows how to design a comfortable chair these days, he comes off as a jovial grandfather. But at his allusion to the current government, his back stiffens and the deeper, gruffer notes of his voice take over. Lula becomes the fiery young union leader he was in the 1970s, and launches into a soapbox-ready tirade.
The dream of Brazil that Lula pursued during his presidency from 2003 to 2010 lies in tatters, he says. Through progressive social programs, paid for by a boom in Brazilian products like steel, soy, and oil, Lula’s government lifted millions out of poverty and transformed life for the country’sBlack majorityandIndigenous minority. Bolsonaro has taken a hammer to all that, scrapping policies that expanded poor people’s access to education, limitedpolice violence against Black communities, andprotected Indigenous lands and the Amazon rain forest.
COVID-19 has killedat least 660,000 Brazilians. The toll, the second highest in the world, waslikely worsened by Bolsonaro, who called the virus “a little flu,” dubbed people who followed isolation guidance “idiots,” and refused to get a vaccine himself and to buy doses for Brazilians when they first became available. ADecember 2020 national surveyshowed more than 55% of Brazilians were living in food insecurity, up from 23% in 2013.
Read More:Why 2022 Might Be the Year Brazil Says Goodbye to President BolsonaroEven Brazil’s young democracyfeels less than secure. Bolsonaro, a defender of the nation’s 20th century military dictatorship, has called mass rallies against judges who displease him and attacked critical journalists. He has also spent months warning of electoral fraud in Brazil, in an echo of President Donald Trump’s behavior before the 2020 U.S. election. In April, hesuggestedelections could be “suspended” if “something abnormal happens.” If he loses, analysts warn, a Brazilian version of a Jan. 6 riot is likely. If he wins, Brazil’s institutions may not withstand another four years of his rule.
Riding out of his political exile like a white knight, Lula claims that he can save Brazil from that nightmare. But it may no longer be the same country he once ruled. Its economy is reeling from the pandemic, with double-digit inflation and no commodities boom on the horizon. A six-year political crisis has bitterly divided society. Geopolitical rifts that Brazil once straddled have widened, and the West is in a new hot-and-cold war with Russia.
Lula, though, believes lightning will strike twice. “In American football, there is a player—as it happens he’s ended up with a Brazilian model,” he says, referring to Tom Brady and his wife Gisele Bündchen. “He’s been the best player in the world for a long time, but in each game, his fans demand that he plays better than he did in the last one. For me, with the presidency, it’s the same thing. I am only running because I can do better than I did before.”The crowd hasbeen waiting for hours. Children sit restlessly on white plastic chairs, crammed together with their parents under a marquee to keep out the searing midday sun. Many wear red T-shirts with the logo of the Homeless Workers’ Movement (MTST), which fights for public housing and has organized this rally in a parking lot in the working-class outskirts of São Paulo. “It’s been a long time,” Lula finally begins over chants of his name, “that I’ve been missing the microphone.”Neighborhoods like this are Lula’s home turf. When he was 7 years old, in 1952, his mother brought him and his seven siblings from Brazil’s desert-like northeast, traveling two weeks in an open truck bed, to São Paulo. They lived in the back room of a bar, and Lula left school at 12 to help support them. By 17, he was making door handles at a factory, and on one night shift, he lost his left pinkie in a machine. At 23, Lula married a neighbor, Maria de Lourdes. But she died two years later from a hepatitis infection while eight months pregnant with their first son, who also died—victims, Lula would later say, of the low-quality health care offered to Brazil’s poor. A few years later, in 1975, he was elected leader of the Steel Workers’ Union of São Bernardo do Campo, a São Paulo district a few miles from the site of this rally.
Many in Brazil know that story, which was immortalized in asyrupy 2009 film,Lula, Son of Brazil.
“Lula’s trajectory has a very strong mythic quality for everyone who fights for social justice in Brazil,” says Guilherme Boulos, 39, coordinator of the MTST, who is often considered Lula’s political heir. “But he himself isn’t a distant, ceremonial person. He still speaks the language of the people.” Lula says the secret to his success lies in his ability to relate to working-class Brazilians—an unusual feat in a country where politicians are prone to price-of-milk gaffes. “I feel proud to have proven that a metal-worker without a university diploma is more competent to govern this country than the elite of Brazil,” he says. “Because the art of government is to use your heart, not only your head.”Bolsonaro, a former army captain devoted to the “says what he really thinks” political style, would probably agree on the importance of connecting emotionally with voters. But Lula’s populism conceals a shrewd pragmatism that has allowed him to navigate Brazil’s choppy political waters. As President, Lula maintained the fiscal conservatism of his center-right predecessor, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, sticking to Brazil’s agreements with the International Monetary Fund and satisfying investors. At the same time, his flagship Bolsa Família program boosted the income of poorer families, while other policies expanded access to education and health care. “If I can tell you that I have a daughter with a law degree, it’s because of programs created by the Lula government,” says Mel Nogueira, 39, at the São Paulo rally. “He represents hope itself.” In 2009, two years before Lula left office with an 83% approval rating, President Barack Obama called him “the most popular politician on earth.”Then it all came crashing down. In 2014, Brazilian investigators uncovered a vast kickbacks-for-contracts scheme, centered on the state oil giant Petrobras, with billions in public funds pilfered. Theprobe was dubbed Car Wash. Lula was no longer in office, but opposition parties in Congress took advantage of anger at the scandal, and an economic crisis in Brazil, to impeach his PT protégéPresident Dilma Rousseff. She was not directly implicated in Car Wash, but lawmakers voted her out on the pretext that she had fudged numbers to make public accounts look better ahead of an election, and replaced her with a right-wing interim President. Two weeks later, prosecutorsalleged thatLula was the graft scheme’s “mastermind.” Theformal chargewas that he had received a beachfront apartment as a bribe from a construction company. Lula denied that he had ever owned the property, but in 2017federal judge Sergio Morosentenced him to nearly 10 years in prison.
From behind bars the following year, Lula mounted a new campaign for October’s presidential race. He was ahead in the polls when Brazil’s top electoral court ruled that he could not be a candidate. Lula detected the logic of that: “It made no sense to impeach Dilma, if two years later, I would be President again. So they had to take me out of the game.” Bolsonarodefeated Lula’s PT replacementby 55.2% to 44.8%. Moro would serve as Justice Minister in Bolsonaro’s government.

Yet some supporters remained unsure about what had taken place under Lula’s watch. “I wish the investigation had convinced me whether he was guilty or innocent,” left-wing filmmaker Petra Costa said in her 2019 documentaryThe Edge of Democracy.
“But instead, I was seeing prosecutors making a spectacle to present their case.”Lula had spent 18 months in prison when the Supreme Court ruled, in November 2019, that defendants can’t be jailed before exhausting their appeal options. (In April 2022, the U.N.’s human-rights committee said Lula’s trial had been biased and violated due process.)It was a dark period in his life. Publications that had once celebrated his accomplishments were describing him as a criminal. His second wife, of 43 years, Marisa Letícia, had died from a stroke during his prosecution, and while he was in jail his 7-year-old grandson Arthur died of meningitis.
Lula deflects questions about his state of mind during that time. He says he drew strength from calls of “Good morning, President” from supporters who maintained a vigil outside the jail. “I was prepared to leave prison without feeling any resentment, only remembering that it was a part of history. I cannot forget it,” he says. “But I can’t put it on the table every day. I want to think about the future.”For all histalk of the future, Lula’s campaign has so far run on nostalgia. When he was President, his Facebook ads point out,unemployment was lower,wages were higher, andfuel was cheap. “Lula hasn’t really presented a plan for the future. For the time being, he is only presenting the idea that he was a better President than Bolsonaro,” says Thomas Traumann, a political consultant and former Brazilian communications secretary.
Bolsonaro’s pandemic mismanagement and attacks on democratic institutions have allowed Lula to command a broad unity coalition. Geraldo Alckmin, a center-right former São Paulo governor who was Lula’s rival in the 2006 election, will be his running mate. Other former critics are backing his campaign, including Felipe Neto, a popular YouTuber who was a fierce voice against the PT during the Car Wash probe. “I’m not a member of the PT, and I have hard criticism about a lot of matters related to Lula. But those criticisms are in the political field, not about human rights,” he says. “I would like to oppose a legitimate leader; I can’t stand doing it against a murderer any longer.”In a country where per capita GDP has been cut almost in half since 2014, even elites, many of whom supported Bolsonaro in 2018, have warmed to the idea that Lula may be better for business. “I am the only candidate with whom people should not be concerned about [economic policy],” Lula says. “Because I’ve been a President twice already. We don’t discuss economic policies before winning the elections. First, you have to win the elections.” That will come as a surprise to many, since the economy has usually been at the center of Brazil’s presidential campaigns. But Lula doubles down, citing stats from Brazil’s 2000s boom. “You have to understand that instead of asking what I will do, just look at what I’ve done.”If he wins, though, Lula would inherit a darker economic outlook than he did in 2003. “It’s hard to quantify how much of the economic success of Lula’s first administration was due to the incredible conditions that he was fortunate to have,” says Gustavo Ribeiro, a political analyst. “It’s going to be a much more daunting task ahead of him.”That is perhaps most evident in the issue of oil. During the PT’s rule, offshore discoveries by Petrobras bolstered state budgets and kept fuel prices low in Brazil. Today the global oil price is surging, driving inflation in Brazil, while efforts tofight the climate crisishave cast a shadow over the future of the oil sector, whichmakes up 11.5%of Brazil’s exports. In Colombia, Gustavo Petro, the left-wing front runner in its upcoming election, has pledged an immediate halt to oil exploration in his country—in line with recommendations of the International Energy Agency. Heexpressed hopethat Lula and other progressive allies would join him in an anti-oil bloc.
Read More:The Amazon Rain Forest Is Nearly Gone. We Went to the Front Lines to See If It Could Be SavedLula’s response will disappoint environmentalists. “Look, Petro has the right to propose whatever he wants. But in the case of Brazil, this is not for real,” he says. “In the case of the world, it’s not for real.” Might he stop exploration for new oil deposits while extracting the oil Brazil has already located? “No, as long as you don’t have alternative energy, you will continue to use the energy that you have.”Though Lula says his administration would scale up Brazil’s production of clean energy, he has also pledged to invest in new oil-refinery infrastructure in an effort to decouple Brazil’s oil from the global market. He frames it as a sovereignty issue. “Think ofour dear Germany: Angela Merkel decided to close all thenuclear power plants. She did not count on the war in Ukraine. And today, Europe depends on Russia for energy.”Lula’s views on foreign policy put him against the prevailing wind today. As President, he refused to take a side in the West’s arguments with its rivals, and prided himself on speaking with Venezuela’s Hugo Chávez or Iran’s Mahmoud Ahmadinejad the same week as George W. Bush or Barack Obama. He says he was “very concerned” when the U.S. and many Latin American countries recognizedJuan Guaidó,Venezuela’s center-left opposition leader, as President in 2019, in a bid to force Nicolás Maduro,Chávez’s authoritarian successor, from power. Even today, after Venezuela’s collapse into kleptocracy, Lula refuses to call Maduro a dictator.
Lula remains a die-hard believer that “two elected heads of state, sitting at a table, looking each other in the eye,” can resolve any differences. He claims that President Joe Biden andE.U. leadersfailed to do that enough in the run-up to Russia’s invasion of its neighbor in February. “The United States has a lot of political clout. And Biden could have avoided [the war], not incited it,” he says. “He could have participated more. Biden could have taken a plane to Moscow to talk to Putin. This is the kind of attitude you expect from a leader.”Most Western analysts argue that Vladimir Putin’s invasion wasfueled by an imperialistic desireto seize territory, rather than any provocations from Ukraine. But in Lula’s view, evenUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who faced a months-long buildup of troops at his borders before the outbreak of war in February, shares blame. “I see the President of Ukraine, speaking on television, being applauded, getting a standing ovation by all the [European] parliamentarians,” he says, shaking his head angrily. “This guy is as responsible as Putin for the war. Because in the war, there’s not just one person guilty.” He argues that it is irresponsible for Western leaders to celebrate Zelensky rather than focusing on closed-door negotiations. “You are encouraging this guy, and then he thinks he is the cherry on your cake. We should be having a serious conversation. OK, you were a nice comedian. But let us not make war for you to show up on TV.”Read More:Inside Zelensky’s WorldThe U.S. and the E.U. should have assured Putin thatUkraine would not join NATO, Lula says, drawing a comparison with the 1962 Cuban missile crisis, when the U.S. and Russia agreed to remove missile deployments from each other’s backyards. Western sanctions on Russia have unfairly impacted other regions’ economies, he adds. “War is no solution,” he says. “And now we are going to have to foot the bill because of the war on Ukraine. Argentina, Bolivia will also have to pay. You’re not punishing Putin. You’re punishing many different countries, you’re punishing mankind.”The conflict underscores the need to renew global institutions, he says. “Today’s United Nations doesn’t represent anything anymore. Governments don’t take the U.N. seriously today, because they make decisions without respecting it,” Lula says. “We need to create a new global governance.” However difficult that may be in today’s fractured world, many leaders and diplomats would welcome Lula’s return: over the past four years, Bolsonaro has burned countless bridges, angering China with racist jokes about COVID-19 andmocking E.U. leaders.
“Brazil will again become a protagonist on the international stage,” Lula pledges, “and we will prove that it’s possible to have a better world.”If Lula’s stance on Ukraine, or his refusal to acknowledge any corruption-related mistakes by his party, suggest stubbornness, his supporters say he is willing to evolve where it matters.
For example, Brazil’s conversation on systemic racism has advanced since 2010. According to Douglas Belchior, an organizer for the nation’s Black Coalition for Rights, Lula’s antipoverty and education-access programs gave him a strong record on improvinglife for Black and mixed-race Brazilians, who make up 56% of the population and 75% of the country’s poorest. But today, Black and Indigenous Brazilians arecalling for more targeted actionto undo the pervasive legacy of slavery and colonialism. Lula’s next administration will need to put more emphasis on antiracism, and correct “some serious failings” by past PT governments on policing, Belchior says. “Going back to the point immediately before Bolsonaro isn’t enough for us. We have to move forward from where the PT governments stopped,” he says. “And Lula has listened to many Black activists, intellectuals, and politicians. He knows that the reconstruction of Brazil requires tackling racism.”Read More:How Black Brazilians Are Looking to a Slavery-Era Form of Resistance to Fight Racial Injustice TodayThere also are signs of movement on environmental issues. Though Lula is less ambitious about phasing out fossil fuels, his administrations were successful in curbing deforestation. Now he is centering the shifts Brazil needs to make on food to fight climate change—arguably more important in a country whereagriculture and land use make up 61.5%of annual greenhouse-gas emissions. “I have improved how I speak. Now I’m not only talking about [ensuring that people can afford] a barbecue, but also about vegetarians,” he tweeted in February. “So we can stimulate a healthier agriculture in our country.”Brazilian mediaattributes some of Lula’s new talking points—which also include an emphasis on gender equality and animal rights—to the influence of his fiancée Rosângela da Silva (no relation). In 2019, Lula announced his engagement to da Silva, a 55-year-old sociologist and PT activist, and they plan to wed in May. He’s hesitant to talk about her—“She can speak for herself!”—but he has “learned from her,” he says. “When you lose your wife, you think, well, my life has no more meaning. Then suddenly this person appears who makes you feel like you want to live again. I’m in love as if I were 20 years old, as if it were my first girlfriend.”Lula believes the marriage will shape the tone of his next political chapter. “A guy as happy as I am doesn’t have to rage—let your opponents do what they want,” he says. “If I can, on the campaign, I will speak only about love. I don’t think it’s possible to be a good President if you only feel hate inside you, if all you want is revenge. No, the past is over. I will build a new Brazil.”With reporting byEloise Barry/LondonRead NextYour browser is out of date.

They’re a sentinel species—an animal whose behaviors can tell scientists if something is going wrong in a particular environment. Chinstraps feed mainly on krill, tiny crustaceans that are the foundation of the marine food chain. Almost every animal in the ocean eats either krill or something else that eats krill, all the way up to the tuna that ends up on our dinner tables. Krill feed on the algae and phytoplankton that cling to the underside of ocean ice. As global temperatures rise because of increased carbon emissions, sea ice is declining. It would be impossible to survey the health of the world’s krill populations, but if chinstraps aren’t doing well, it’s likely that krill, and everything that eats krill, aren’t doing well either. And our carbon canaries are not doing well. The Stony Brook researchers found that most of the chinstrap colonies had declined over the past 50 years, some by half and others by up to 77%.<\/p>\nRead more: <\/strong>"https:\/\/time.com\/5781302\/climate-change-is-decimating-the-chinstrap-penguins-of-antarctica\/\" >Climate Change is Decimating the Chinstrap Penguins of Antarctica<\/em><\/a><\/p>\nWe can wring our hands over the looming loss of a charismatic species, but “Save the Penguins: Use Solar” doesn’t go far enough as a slogan. It doesn’t fully encompass what the loss of this penguin species portends for the future of humanity on this planet. Climate change moves so slowly as to feel almost imperceptible to us—what difference, after all, does a fraction of a single degree make on our day-to-day lives?—but lay that trajectory over something more fragile and less resilient like the chinstraps, and it quickly becomes clear the domino effect of climate change is already starting to reach uncomfortably close to home.<\/p>\nOr at least it should. There is an incomprehensible disconnect between what climate science says must be done—an immediate shift in how we produce energy, travel, and eat—and what we, and our leaders, are willing to do. At what point does the distant threat of ecological collapse assume the fierce urgency of now? When the sea ice is entirely gone? When the penguins are?<\/p>\nBy then it will be too late.<\/p>\n"inline-portrait_small_2x alignnone \">"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/api.time.com\/wp-content\/plugins\/lazy-load-0.7\/images\/1x1.trans.gif\"

Nearly five months after Antarctica’s high temperature record, the Siberian city of Verkhoyansk reached a"https:\/\/www.downtoearth.org.in\/news\/climate-change\/wmo-confirms-2020-heat-record-in-siberian-town-80709\" target=\"_blank\"> searing historical high<\/a> of 38°C (100.4°F) on June 20, 2020, heralding a summer of extreme heat and wildfires in a region better known for ice storms. Overall, 2020 marked the hottest year on record for both poles, and both the Arctic and the Antarctic saw precipitous declines in sea ice. When there isn’t enough ice to reflect the sun’s rays back into space, that heat is absorbed by the dark ocean, accelerating rising water temperatures and ice melt, altering ocean currents, weakening the jet stream, and changing wind patterns. The effects ripple through the global ecosystem, manifesting in greater drought, heat, floods, and storms. “What happens in the Arctic doesn’t stay in the Arctic,” Admiral Karl L. Schultz, commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard, told me on a September 2021 visit to the Canadian Arctic outpost of Resolute. Hurricane Ida had just ripped through the Caribbean and parts of the U.S., killing 107 from Venezuela to Connecticut and"https:\/\/www.nhc.noaa.gov\/data\/tcr\/AL092021_Ida.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> costing more than $75 billion in damage<\/a>. While Resolute seemed worlds away from the destruction left in Ida’s wake, the two were opposite sides of the same coin, Schultz said. Ida was a tropical storm that exploded into a hurricane with little warning—the kind of rapid intensification caused by a warming Arctic, and a harbinger of more to come.<\/p>\nRead more:<\/strong>"https:\/\/time.com\/6095064\/arctic-climate-change-coast-guard\/\" >Why a Warming Arctic Has the U.S. Coast Guard Worried About the Rest of the Country<\/a><\/em><\/p>\nWhat happens at the top of the planet matters to everyone on earth. But it matters most to those who live there. A lack of sea ice exposes vulnerable shorelines to rapid erosion, forcing indigenous villages that have lived in harmony with the Arctic’s extremes for centuries to relocate inland. Hunting for seal, walrus, and polar bear—a mainstay of native Arctic traditions and subsistence survival—is not possible without winter’s thick slabs of ice. For many communities on the edge, the loss of sea ice spells cultural disruption as well as dislocation in a preview of what global warming, if left unchecked, will eventually bring to the rest of the world.<\/p>\nA few weeks after leaving Resolute, I traveled to the village of Unalakleet on Alaska’s northwest coast to meet Laureli Ivanoff, an Inupiaq climate activist. Ivanoff’s home freezer was full of the wealth of Arctic Alaska’s short summer season: berries and tundra greens, wild rhubarb, salmon caviar, caribou fat, and bear meat. The one thing she doesn’t have is the food that sustained her culture for generations:ugruk,<\/em> or bearded seal. When a seal is harvested, every part of the animal is used, from the fat to the skin and the intestines. It anchors the hunter in a community ritual of sharing and respect for nature. When Ivanoff was a child, ice formed in the early fall and stayed deep into spring—these days she wonders if she will see ice at all in coming years.<\/p>\n“Colonization and assimilation have taken away so much,” Ivanoff told me—including language, dancing, and ceremonies that bound the community together. All that is left is the native food traditions. “And now climate change is taking even that.” She watched her 3-year-old son play on the floor as he took a toy boat on an imaginaryugruk<\/em> hunt. “How much of his culture will he get to keep?”<\/p>\nA fundamental part of human nature is to want to pass something on to the next generation that symbolizes our values, be it a cultural tradition or material goods earned over a lifetime of labor. If my daughter inherits a damaged planet, racked by heat waves, befouled with a plastic tide, and witness to waves of climate migrants fleeing uninhabitable lands, what does that say about the values my generation cultivated in its dogged pursuit of perpetual growth? The science is clear: to prevent climate devastation we must cut greenhouse emissions nearly in half by 2030 compared with 2010 levels. That means real sacrifice in the short term, especially for those of us lucky enough to live in highly developed parts of the world. At this point, prioritizing the climate offers a stronger guarantee for the future than continuing to accumulate wealth the way we have been.<\/p>\nRead more: <\/strong>"https:\/\/time.com\/6174947\/melting-arctic-indigenous-communities-alaska\" >Polar Paradox: The Melting Arctic Could Destroy Indigenous Ways of Life While Making Some Alaskans Rich<\/em><\/a><\/p>\nI came away from both poles with a mounting sense of frustration over a global unwillingness to act in the face of certain doom, as well as fear. A warming Arctic is not just a warning. It has the potential to take us with it in its demise. Permafrost, the layer of permanently frozen ground that undergirds both poles, is a carbon bomb waiting to go off. As the soil thaws it releases greenhouse gases, warming the region further and setting off a perpetual feedback loop. Scientists don’t yet know if Arctic emissions are on par with a small developing nation, or, more likely, another China. (The South Pole’s permafrost is trapped under the Antarctic ice sheet. If that melts away, we have bigger things to worry about, like"https:\/\/nsidc.org\/cryosphere\/quickfacts\/icesheets.html\" target=\"_blank\">a 200-ft. sea-level rise<\/a>).<\/p>\nWe tend to think of the earth’s polar regions as victims of our own carbon profligacy. But if we push them past the tipping point, they will become perpetrators. Our polar regions protect life as we know it only as much as we protect them. It’s worth sacrificing a little bit more to ensure we leave a better world behind.<\/p>\n","read_more":true,"section":{"name":"Climate","slug":"climate","url":"https:\/\/time.com\/climate\/","description":"","climate":true,"all_sections":["time-section-climate","time-section-world"]},"tag":{"name":"Oceans","slug":"oceans","url":"https:\/\/time.com\/tag\/oceans\/"},"tags":"climate

To this day there are no roads connecting the settlement to the rest of the U.S., or to the rest of Alaska, for that matter. The options are dogsled, snowmobile, sea, or air.<\/p>\nOpting for the latter, I landed in Nome (pop. 3,699) in late September. As I waited for my suitcase, I struck up a conversation with a man who called himself Yukon John. The unusually long summer season had been a good one for the gold miner, he said. To prove it, he pressed a small, heavy-for-its-size plastic jar into my hands. It was full of granulated gold, panned from the mineral-rich sandbanks just offshore. Then he added a trio of thumb-size nuggets. That was just a tiny sample of his latest haul, he told me. Last spring the ice that usually locks the coast in an impenetrable shield broke up early, and if the previous year was anything to go by, it wouldn’t re-form until late fall. That gave Yukon John plenty of time to dredge for"https:\/\/entertainment.time.com\/2012\/03\/12\/top-10-unusual-reality-tv-jobs\/slide\/bering-sea-gold\/\" >gold at his Bering Sea claim.<\/a> The miner said he doesn’t spend much time thinking about global warming, but if climate change means more opportunities for hitting the sandbanks, well, “bring it on. The way I see it, we have to take advantage of whatever comes our way.”<\/p>\n"lazy\" class=\"size-portrait_small_2x wp-image-6175461\"

On the one hand, communities in the region face cultural and environmental catastrophe; on the other, they are starting to play host to a modern-day gold rush at the top of the world—one that invites geopolitical tensions as rival nations compete for resources, be they fish, minerals, or shipping routes.<\/p>\nRead more: <\/strong>"https:\/\/time.com\/6171610\/palau-marine-protected-area-climate-justice\/\" >One Island Nation’s Controversial Plan To Take Climate Justice Into Its Own Hands<\/em><\/a><\/p>\nThe Russian government is already positioning itself as a net beneficiary of global warming, writing in its"http:\/\/publication.pravo.gov.ru\/Document\/View\/0001202010260033?index=9&rangeSize=1\" target=\"_blank\">2020 Arctic Strategy<\/a> that “climate change contributes to the emergence of new economic opportunities.” With half the Arctic coastline under its control, it’s not hard to see why.

Tweeten for TIME<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\nOther nations, especially those with land in or near the Arctic Circle, are eyeing the Russian buildup with concern. It’s one thing to dredge a canal through your own country and charge transit fees. It’s another thing entirely to establish a commercial trading route in international waters. Admiral Karl L. Schultz, commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard, worries that the Russians might try to recoup their investment in icebreakers by turning the Northern Sea Route into a kind of marine toll road, requiring—and charging for—specially licensed pilots and icebreaker escorts through the passage. “If you can knock 10, 11 days off the transit between Shanghai and Europe on a repetitive basis and in a cost-effective way, that’s worth something,”"https:\/\/time.com\/6095064\/arctic-climate-change-coast-guard\/\" >he tells TIME.<\/a> “Of course they want to profit from that.” But doing so threatens one of the fundamental tenets of the high seas: the freedom to navigate.<\/p>\nRussia isn’t just building up ports.

The Russian state media agency"https:\/\/tass.com\/defense\/1346611\" target=\"_blank\"> TASS<\/a> has leaked government plans to establish a new navy division, dubbed the Arctic Fleet, which would be responsible for securing the country’s Arctic interests. “It absolutely makes me a little bit concerned about what’s going on,” says Schultz. He was speaking from the deck of the U.S. Coast Guard cutterHealy<\/em> as it transited the Canadian Arctic in August. The 23-year-oldHealy<\/em> is the U.S.’s most technologically advanced icebreaker. The country has only one other, and it is nearly 50 years old. If the U.S. is to keep pace with Russia in the Arctic, says Schultz, it will need to increase its Arctic-capable fleet. “Presence equals influence. And we don’t have a lot of presence up here.”<\/p>\nRead more:<\/strong>"https:\/\/time.com\/6095064\/arctic-climate-change-coast-guard\/\" >Why a Warming Arctic Has the U.S. Coast Guard Worried About the Rest of the Country<\/a><\/em><\/p>\nInfluence will matter when it comes to control of the region’s petroleum reserves, seabed minerals, and—in a newer development—seafood. Warming oceans are pushing global fish stocks northward, into polar areas where rival nations could clash over fishing rights. The Bering Sea, shared by Russia and the U.S., is already home to approximately 40% of U.S. fish and crab stocks, and rivals New England for the most profitable U.S. fishery. This could become an unexpected flash point as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine ratchets up tensions with the U.S. Jeremy Greenwood, a fellow with the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C., and a U.S. Coast Guard officer, isn’t expecting a hot conflict, but he is concerned that Russia might infringe on a maritime boundary that, while negotiated, was never formally agreed to by the former Soviet Union. “The Russians have always hated it,” Greenwood says. An infringement “would lead to chaos in the Bering Sea. We’d be seizing each other’s vessels for illegal fishing. I know it sounds stupid to talk about crabs in the context of Ukraine, but countries have literally gone to shooting wars over fisheries. It brought us to the brink during the Cold War. It’s a big deal.”<\/p>\nThe Alaskan fishing fleet got a glimpse of what that could look like in August 2020, when the Russian navy conducted"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2020\/11\/12\/us\/russia-military-alaska-arctic-fishing.html?\" target=\"_blank\"> military operations<\/a> inside the U.S. economic zone of the Bering Sea and warned all boats in the area to get out of their way.

redraws the Arctic map, regional cooperation over fish stocks, shipping routes, research programs, and resource extraction will be vital to protect what was once optimistically dubbed the Pole of

The immediate challenge: seven of the eight nations that make up the Arctic Council, established in 1996 to facilitate cooperation and collaboration in Arctic affairs, put a stop to all joint activities to protest the invasion of Ukraine by the eighth member.<\/p>\nAs climate change redraws the Arctic map, regional cooperation over fish stocks, shipping routes, research programs, and resource extraction will be vital to protect what was once optimistically dubbed the “"https:\/\/www.global-briefing.org\/2011\/07\/let-the-north-pole-be-a-pole-of-peace\/\" target=\"_blank\">Pole of Peace<\/a>” by the last Soviet President, Mikhail Gorbachev.<\/p>\nClimate scientists tracking the global impacts of polar-ice melt like to say that what happens in the Arctic doesn’t stay in the Arctic. The inverse, it seems, is also true.<\/p>\n\/>\nDiana Haecker remembers the exact day<\/strong> that climate change became real to her. Haecker, who in addition to owningMushing Magazine<\/em> is the editor of the NomeNugget,<\/em> Alaska’s oldest continuously published newspaper, leafed through a book of bound archives at theNugget<\/em> offices in September. She paused at a cover photo taken on Feb. 20, 2018, from the shore of Little Diomede Island, the U.S.’s westernmost outpost in the Bering Strait. You could see nothing but water and waves all the way to the horizon. “When I saw this photo, I had to catch my breath because that is so scary,” says Haecker. All of this should be a blanket of ice, she recalls thinking. “That is when I realized we were probably past the tipping point.” A headline in that week’s edition was equally frightening: “Nome at 51°F, Record High Temperatures Melt Winter Away.” The ice didn’t return that year.<\/p>\n"inline-portrait_small_2x alignnone \">"lazy\"

doesn’t just protect Arctic coasts from savage winter storms. It’s also an essential element of the region’s—and the world’s—food web. Algae growing underneath feeds the fish larvae and tiny crustaceans that are the food source for most ocean inhabitants, and marine mammals like seals and polar bears need the ice floes to hunt and give birth. Furthermore, Alaska’s coastal Indigenous populations rely on sea ice for subsistence hunting. One seal can keep a family in meat for a year. In communities around Nome—where groceries are flown in at great expense, a watermelon can cost $50 and a frozen Thanksgiving turkey up to $60—hunting is not a pastime, it’s a lifeline. “The ocean is our grocery store,” says Austin Ahmasuk, a marine advocate at Kawerak, a regional nonprofit that serves the Alaska Native residents of the Bering Strait region. “Subsistence foods—animals and fish, birds, resources from the land and water—collectively comprise a majority of a person’s diet in a [Native Alaskan] village.”<\/p>\nRead more: <\/strong>"https:\/\/time.com\/5781302\/climate-change-is-decimating-the-chinstrap-penguins-of-antarctica\/\" >Climate Change is Decimating the Chinstrap Penguins of Antarctica<\/em><\/a><\/p>\nThe latest report from the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change noted that “increasing weather and climate extreme events have exposed … people to acute food insecurity and reduced water security, with the largest impacts observed in many locations and\/or communities in … the Arctic, especially for Indigenous Peoples.” Already communities are starting to adapt. Some have started hunting moose, a once foreign species that is now moving northward into the tundra as new vegetation takes root in the thawing permafrost. On the coast, pollock is starting to replace the cold-loving salmon and arctic char that used to dominate the northern Bering Sea. “As we continue to warm, we’ve got to come up with new words,” says Melissa Maktuayaq Johnson, a former executive director of the Bering Seas Elders Group from Nome who is now working to promote Inupiaq heritage and language. “The other day, someone asked me the Yup’ik word for octopus. We don’t have one, because octopus wasn’t here before.”<\/p>\n"inline-longform_large alignnone \">"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/api.time.com\/wp-content\/plugins\/lazy-load-0.7\/images\/1x1.trans.gif\" alt

Eskimos having a hundred words for snow needs to be updated in a grim vocabulary for a warming world. Some Alaska natives have started using the Yup’ik neologismusteq<\/em> to refer to rapid, climate-driven erosion and ground collapse caused by permafrost melt. Permafrost researchers are adopting it as well. “It kind of encapsulates everything we are seeing right now, how the cause and the effect are related,” says Sue Natali, a permafrost specialist who leads the Woodwell Center’s Arctic Program.<\/p>\n\/>\nAdaptation is the climate world’s anodyne word<\/strong> for the wrenching decisions that must be made as threatened communities face the realities of irrevocable change. Dictionaries will have to be updated, communities will have to craft new traditions, and diets will change. Shishmaref, an island community not far from Nome, lost several buildings and a burial ground tousteq.<\/em> In 2016"https:\/\/edition.cnn.com\/2016\/08\/18\/us\/alaskan-town-votes-to-move\/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">a majority of residents voted to permanently relocate to the mainland<\/a>. Nome may yet be able to surf the looming disruption with minimal loss if it can get ahead of the change. When theCrystal Serenity<\/em> became the first large cruise ship to traverse the Arctic in 2016, Nome was one of its first stops on the 32-day voyage, bringing in more than 1,000 day-trippers eager to spend money at its cash-strapped businesses. Now, following a COVID-19 pandemic pause, 27 cruise liners are scheduled to stop at the frontier town this summer. During my visit, boats had to anchor offshore and ferry in tourists or goods by smaller craft; when the port is lengthened and deepened, they will be able to park alongside the jetty. “This is a real opportunity for Alaska and for Nome and for those travelers coming over the Northwest Passage,”"https:\/\/nomenugget.com\/news\/governor-mike-dunleavy-visits-nome-tour-port\" target=\"_blank\">said Alaska Governor Mike Dunleavy on a visit to Nome in August<\/a>. “Hopefully it means more jobs for the area.”<\/p>\nA study undertaken by the Nome Visitor Center estimates that each cruise-line tourist brings in several hundreds of dollars to local shops and tour companies. But bigger boats also mean that the cost of bringing in goods, from construction materials to fuel, watermelons, and frozen turkeys, would go down, making life more affordable for residents. To Nome Harbormaster Lucas Stotts, the port extension can’t be built fast enough. “Thinking ahead 10 years, much less 20 or 30, there will be even more traffic and we will be even further behind the curve. We have some catching up to do.” Indeed, U.S. investment in Arctic ports and waterways already lags behind that of the other Arctic nations.<\/p>\n"inline-longform_large alignnone \">"lazy\"

port in Nome could bring problems as well. More traffic means an increased risk of introducing invasive species hitching rides in the hulls of foreign vessels, which could devastate a Bering Strait ecosystem already under pressure from climate change. Maktuayaq Johnson says increased noise from the recent uptick in shipping is already disturbing the ocean ecosystem, driving fish and marine mammals away and disrupting the Native subsistence lifestyle. More ships mean more exhaust fumes that blacken what sea ice remains, accelerating the melting process. By and large, she says, Nome’s native community has not been involved enough in the planning process. “Development is important. But it can’t just be about economic gain. You’ve got to incorporate how this will impact our culture, our language, and our way of life. Right now the port expansion feels like one more opportunity for outsiders to come in and get that monetary gain.”<\/p>\nRead more: <\/strong>"https:\/\/time.com\/6174966\/north-south-pole-melting-climate-change\" >After Visiting Both Ends of the Earth, I Realized How Much Trouble We’re In<\/a><\/em><\/p>\nTo Denise Michels, a Native Alaskan and, as Nome’s former mayor, an early supporter of the port expansion, the project is more about protecting the community than profiting from climate change. The more the Arctic warms, the more boats will come through the Bering Strait. Nome has to be prepared for that and prepared for the consequences as well; she envisions a search-and-rescue station that could help mariners in distress or send out emergency containment efforts in the case of an oil spill or other environmental crisis.<\/p>\nA port expansion, done right, should include the authority to direct traffic away from fish-spawning grounds or nurseries at certain times of the year. “We can’t stop the traffic. What we can do is try to benefit from it. That’s how we adapt to climate change.”<\/p>\n"inline-longform_large alignnone \">"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/api.time.com\/wp-content\/plugins\/lazy-load-0.7\/images\/1x1.trans.gif\" alt

As we were preparing to go to press, the Pulitzer Prize Board awarded a special citation to the “journalists of Ukraine for their courage, endurance, and commitment to truthful reporting during Vladimir Putin’s ruthless invasion of their country and his propaganda war in Russia.” The Independent—founded in November by journalists who left their previous employer after a scandal over editorial integrity—is a remarkable example of the bravery it takes to keep reporting on a brutal conflict that hits so close to home. TIME contributor Lisa Abend has been speaking with Rudenko since the first week of the Russian invasion, and we are thrilled to be able to bring the story of this enterprising editor and her

In 2019, as the world marked what was then the second warmest year on record, she wrote from"https:\/\/time.com\/longform\/jacobabad-extreme-heat\/\" >Jacobabad, Pakistan<\/a>, about what it’s like to live in one of the hottest cities in the world. But one thing she had never aspired to do was visit the Arctic or Antarctica. “I like trees, and I hate the cold,” says Baker, who these days is based in Rome as TIME’s senior international climate and environmental correspondent. “To be honest I was never really interested in going to the poles.”<\/p>\n"p2\">That changed in early 2020 when she was invited on a Greenpeace-sponsored research expedition to"https:\/\/time.com\/5781302\/climate-change-is-decimating-the-chinstrap-penguins-of-antarctica\/\" >assess penguin populations on the Antarctic Peninsula<\/a>. After spending three weeks among the glaciers, and in the company of climate scientists and ornithologists, she was hooked. As scientists began to predict an ice-free Arctic summer as soon as the mid-2030s, the other end of the earth began to call as well.

They had spent long days in February reporting on an invasion that high-level sources had told them was imminent. Editor in chief Olga Rudenko and the other senior editors had consulted with the outlet’s two dozen or so staff members to make sure each had an evacuation plan and had withdrawn cash so they could keep operating if the banks closed. They had handed over passwords and instructions to contacts in North America on how to keep their website online in case their internet was knocked out. And yet a"https:\/\/time.com\/6151505\/ukraine-home-putin-kyiv-crimea\/\" >s Russian President Vladimir Putin declared a “special military operation”<\/a> in the early hours of Feb. 24, none of them could quite believe what was happening. “We thought they would try to take more territory in eastern Ukraine,” says Rudenko. “Not that it would be a full-fledged war.”<\/p>\n"p2\">In the days and weeks to come, the Kyiv Independent would become the world’s primary source for reliable English-language journalism on that war. Just three days in, its Twitter following had grown from 30,000 to 1 million; it now has more than 2 million. In both its newfound influence and the widespread support it received—a crowdfunding campaign has raised nearly $2 million to keep the platform going—the transformation has been extraordinary. The Kyiv Independent had launched a mere 14 weeks before the invasion—after a scandal over journalistic independence at their previous employer inspired the editors to strike out on their own, and pulled Rudenko, who is now leading a team under exceptionally difficult circumstances, back from what was meant to be a break from journalism.<\/p>\nRead More: <\/strong>"https:\/\/time.com\/6155219\/ukrainian-journalists-challenges-reporting-war-kyiv-independent\/\" >What It’s Like for Ukrainian Journalists Reporting on the War in Their Country<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n"p1\">“We are starting this ambitious project that is based on values we really, really believe in, which is"https:\/\/time.com\/6173543\/world-press-freedom-index-2022\/\" >independent journalism<\/a>,” Rudenko, 33, says. “And we are doing it at the same time as our country is fighting this war for survival.”<\/p>\n"p2\">Those are high stakes for someone who never expected to be in charge. “If you saw me when I was 14 or 15, you’d never think this person would grow up to lead anything,” Rudenko says with the modesty I’ve come to expect over the course of our four conversations over the past two months. A self-professed geek with a love for books and Japanese anime, Rudenko grew up in Dnipro, in central Ukraine. After her father’s death when Olga was 4, her mother, an accountant, raised her alone and encouraged her to pursue a career in economics. But Rudenko, eager to “earn a living writing and meet interesting people,” chose to study journalism at university in Dnipro.<\/p>\nAfter an internship at a local paper, she moved to Kyiv in 2011, where she landed a job at the KyivPost,<\/i> Ukraine’s only English-language newspaper at the time. Although the paper’s mainly international audience was relatively small, it had a reputation for doing serious journalism. “It was hardcore investigative journalism—those journalists weren’t scared of anything,” says Oleksiy Sorokin, who became a political reporter at the paper in 2018 and is now the Kyiv Independent’s political editor. “It was always going up against the establishment and those in power. The notion was that they’ve obviously done something bad, but we have to prove it.”<\/p>\n"inline-longform_large alignnone \">"lazy\"

Leaders cover<\/strong><\/em><\/a><\/p>\n"p1\">Rudenko didn’t know about that prestige when, in 2011, she got a job as a lifestyle reporter at the paper’s recently launched Ukrainian-language website. All she knew was that she found the newsroom terrifying. Struggling to keep up with conversations in English, she felt overwhelmed. Rather than running away from her anxiety, she ran toward it. Early on, she volunteered to cover a recent opinion poll even though it would mean writing in English. She brought the piece to the editor the next day. “He opens the story in front of me and says, ‘It’s OK, I’m just going to change a few things.’” she recalls. “And then he—control A—deletes the whole story and starts writing a new one.”<\/p>\n"p1\">She got better, and was soon writing exclusively in English, and not only about lifestyle: she also covered the 2014 Russia-backed separatist conflict in the Donbas region. In 2016, she became national editor, and by 2017, she was the deputy to the editor in chief.<\/p>\n"p1\">With each promotion, Rudenko doubted herself—and, in fact, initially turned down the deputy job. “It was ‘Who, me?’” she says. “But when it was announced, the reaction from people was, ‘We thought you already were that.’ I realized how different my vision of myself was from how people see me.”<\/p>\n\/>\n"p3\">In 2021, Rudenko<\/strong> accepted a fellowship at the University of Chicago’s Stigler Center. By then she had been at the KyivPost<\/i> for a decade—and those 10 years, coupled with rising tensions over editorial independence between the newspaper’s staff and its third owner, real estate developer Adnan Kivan, convinced her she needed to take some time to figure out her next steps. The plan was to spend the fall studying in the U.S., then return to Ukraine and simply relax for a while; she wasn’t sure she’d return to thePost.<\/i><\/p>\n"p1\">But a major scandal at the newspaper back in Kyiv got in the way. Succumbing to pressure from Ukrainian authorities unhappy with thePost<\/i>’s critical coverage, Kivan tried to appoint a more compliant editor, and when the staff refused to accept her, fired them all on Nov. 8. “It was one of the largest media scandals of the Zelensky era,” says Roman Horbyk, researcher in media and communications at Sodertorn University in Sweden. “It wasn’t the kind of thing we expected in Ukraine after 2014, and it left a bad aftertaste.”<\/p>\n"p1\">Rudenko was in Chicago at the time, which left senior editors Toma Istomina and Sorokin to handle the fallout. They soon realized, as Sorokin puts it, “that we weren’t ready to let it go.” That night, Sorokin, Istomina, and head of investigations Anna Myroniuk called Rudenko and broke the news—and shared their decision to start something new. “Count me in,” Rudenko said.<\/p>\n"p1\">They didn’t have a name for it yet, but on Nov. 15, the group sent out the first iteration of what would become the Kyiv Independent. Initially it was just a newsletter, but they soon added a podcast—and finally, after acquiring business partners and some grant funding, a news website. When it came time to choose an editor in chief, the solution, says Istomina, was obvious. “We all knew it was going to be Olga; she had the most experience and the complete trust of the staff. But still, being a humble person, she presented a message about how we had to have a poll first. Of course, everyone voted for her. It was almost as great as when"https:\/\/time.com\/6171277\/volodymyr-zelensky-interview-ukraine-war\/\" >Zelensky got 73% of the vote<\/a>.”<\/p>\n"p1\">By then, the rumble of the Russian threat was growing louder. But as they raced to figure out funding and workflows, and even while they reported on the military buildup on Ukraine’s borders, the Kyiv Independent staff were motivated by something else. “There was just this strong sense of, We need to succeed, because if we don’t, then the bad guys win,” Rudenko says, referring to the wealthy oligarchs, some linked to Putin, who influenced what appeared in the Ukrainian press. “It felt like we were defending the essence of journalism.”<\/p>\n\/>\n"p1\">Since the invasion<\/strong>, the nature of that defense has changed. The 24 or so reporters and editors on staff continue to turn out deeply reported stories—Rudenko ticks off several that made her proud, including one on the street cleaners and garbage collectors who continued to do their jobs even while Kyiv was being bombed, and another that followed a Ukrainian military unit as it collected the bodies of Russian soldiers. But high emotions and the relentless pace of events—to say nothing of"https:\/\/time.com\/6151578\/russia-disinformation-ukraine-social-media\/\" >wartime disinformation and propaganda<\/a>—has made ensuring the accuracy of their reporting more challenging. “Separating the facts from opinion and emotion when your country is at war—that’s an extra difficult task.”<\/p>\n"inline-longform_large

Both the war, and running the team—when the challenge is so big and so important, it’s like something arises in you; a coping mechanism, or some inner force that you didn’t know you had.”<\/p>\nRead More<\/strong>:"https:\/\/time.com\/6151572\/russian-media-ukraine-coverage\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The World Is Watching Russia Invade Ukraine. But Russian Media Is Telling a Different Story<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n"p1\">That’s not to say she’s immune to the stress and trauma. A lifelong propensity for tears—great sobs she was helpless to control that would erupt whenever a kid in school was mean to her or a colleague had cross words—has suddenly dried up; with two exceptions she has not cried at all since the war started. And when she looks at an elevator selfie that she, Sorokin, and Istomina took as they left the office in the early morning of Feb. 24, not two hours before the invasion began, she no longer fully recognizes its subjects. “None of us are the same people,” she says. “We may look the same and talk to each other as usual and even joke around. But inside, we are now forever changed and traumatized by what happened two hours after that photo was taken.”<\/p>\n"p2\">Trauma, and responsibility. Reporting from a hot spot is always voluntary for the Kyiv Independent’s staff, and Rudenko sees part of her job as reining in reporters whose enthusiasm for covering the conflict might override their better sense. Even so, in a conflict that has already killed"https:\/\/www.aa.com.tr\/en\/europe\/18-journalists-killed-so-far-during-russias-war-on-ukraine\/2556170\" target=\"_blank\">at least 18 journalists<\/a>, she can’t escape the sense that she is putting her staff in danger. “For each of them, I’ve played a scenario in my head where I have to tell their family that something happened to them, that they were taken captive, went missing or worse,” she says. “I try to not let myself go too far into that, because these thoughts are swampy and they can distract me from the work that needs to be done.”<\/p>\nRead More: <\/strong>"https:\/\/time.com\/6158433\/brent-renaud-death-journalist-risks\/\" >Brent Renaud’s Death Reminds Us of the High Costs of Pursuing the Truth<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n"p1\">To keep those thoughts at bay, she tries to picture the team together again, with the war over and their focus once again on exposing corruption and injustice. But for now, the job has given her and the rest of the staff a framework for dealing with the devastation they confront every day. “Reporting on a war in your own country is both a blessing and a curse,” she says. “It’s a curse because you can’t turn off the news. It’s your job to be looking at the atrocities,"https:\/\/time.com\/6166681\/bucha-massacre-ukraine-dispatch\/\" >at every photo of a dead person in Bucha<\/a>, every civilian killed with their hands tied behind their back, every horrible photo of a mass grave—there’s no walking away.”<\/p>\n"p1\">But the work also provides a way of dealing with the horror—and of making meaning out of it. “As a journalist,” she says, “you have the privilege of knowing that your job is actually helping. I’m not going to say it’s helping the country or helping the troops. But you’re helping the right thing to happen.”<\/p>\n","read_more":true,"section":{"name":"World","slug":"world","url":"https:\/\/time.com\/world\/","description":"The latest news and analysis from

>Roderick Ejuetami<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\nBut CKay has much bigger ambitions than one hit, and he admires the way that artists like Lil Nas X and Doja Cat have turned virality into sustainable careers. By the looks of it, he’s well on his way: on his first global tour this year, he was greeted with sold-out screaming fans from London to New York to Los Angeles, where they yelled every word of"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Ypr5QN7Xn_M\" target=\"_blank\">his recent single “Emiliana.”<\/a> (He also performed to raucous applause at"https:\/\/time.com\/6168688\/coachella-enters-the-metaverse\/\" >Coachella in April<\/a>.) Women, particularly, seem taken with the man who calls himself “Africa’s boyfriend.” When asked about this particularly large slice of his fandom, he demurs, saying, “I think they just feel my vibe, my music, the way I dress.”<\/p>\nWhile “Love Nwantiti” continues to soar—it still tops theBillboard<\/em>’s U.S. Afrobeats Songs chart—CKay has turned his focus to his debut album, which is slated to arrive this year. (During his U.S. tour, he met with stars like Diplo and Fat Joe, but wouldn’t reveal any details about collaborations.) If his current music repertoire is any guide, he’ll be using influence from Nigeria, the Middle East, and American hip-hop to push Afrobeats—a genre that was pioneered by Fela Kuti and more recently popularized by stars like Davido and"https:\/\/time.com\/collection\/next-generation-leaders\/5896374\/burna-boy-next-generation-leaders\/\" >Burna Boy<\/a>—to new musical and cultural heights. As always, he’s doing things his way. “I represent the 21st century of an African experience,” he says. “If I’m going to make Afrobeats exactly the way my predecessors made it, then there’s literally no point.”<\/p>\n","read_more":true,"section":{"name":"Entertainment","slug":"entertainment","url":"https:\/\/time.com\/entertainment\/","description":"From esoteric art to Housewives hullaballoo,

<\/span>"font-weight: 400;\">four<\/span>"font-weight: 400;\"> collections he’s released for his personal brand offer a look at his burgeoning design sensibility. His work is characterized by sharp tailoring, bold silhouettes, and richly textured fabrics, all rendered with an elegant sensuality. This manifests in sleek leather dresses with plunging necklines, exquisite suiting, and luxurious jersey bodysuits. He sums up his vision as <\/span>"font-weight: 400;\">“Black elegance,”<\/span>"font-weight: 400;\"> and it’s clear he finds power in celebrating his culture and identity through his designs. His first collection for his personal label debuted in fall 2020 in the wake of the"https:\/\/time.com\/6172048\/covid-19-controlled-pandemic-endemic\/\" >COVID-19 pandemic<\/a> and a summer of reckoning with"https:\/\/time.com\/6046299\/fighting-injustice-world\/\" >systemic racism<\/a>. Inspired by Trinidad’s Carnival and its joyous celebration of freedom (which held even more significance for Trinidadians following the emancipation of slaves in 1838), Davis sought to present a thoughtful narrative about Blackness: “It was a collection that had a different outlook on people of color,” he says. “I wanted to present them in a very elegant and sophisticated way, rather than this negative context.”<\/span><\/p>\n"font-weight: 400;\">His body of work is also largely inspired by his family. Past collections have paid homage to his grandmother’s “Sunday best” looks for church, family trips to Trinidad, and patterns of migration. During his research-heavy design process, he often thinks of his sisters as well as the elders in his life, ensuring that there are pieces that speak to both younger and older generations.“I think the best collections are the personal ones where people can feel a part of the story,” he says. “If they can relate to something, it always translates.”<\/span><\/p>\n","read_more":true,"section":{"name":"Entertainment","slug":"entertainment","url":"https:\/\/time.com\/entertainment\/","description":"From esoteric art to Housewives

Their “metaversal origin story,” as Karina calls it, is meant to capture the imagination. The story of aespa, designed and launched by their Korean talent-management agency,"https:\/\/www.smentertainment.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">SM Entertainment<\/a>, is an ambitious new piece of the SM Culture Universe. Like"https:\/\/time.com\/6171012\/marvel-movies-shows-upcoming\/\" >Marvel<\/a> or DC Comics, the company is creating an interconnected world in which all of its artists will exist—with complex backstories, narrative arcs, villain threats, and more. It is still something of a sketch. “Truthfully, we were worried in the beginning, because this concept of ours is something new to our company as well,” says Ningning. “But our fans really loved it and are even creating memes out of it.”<\/p>\n"p3\">"s1\">The result: aespa is learning the concept of"https:\/\/time.com\/6163109\/metaverse-fiction-scifi\/\" > metaverse<\/a>-native artistry at the same time as its fans—each song and video another piece in the puzzle. The goal is to “normalize metaverse concepts and have our fans and other people be a little more comfortable with the whole idea of it,” Giselle says. It’s a journey that fans can go on by taking the time to watch aespa’s videos and consume their content, beyond just enjoying the songs. They want to make people think—about the selves we present online, and about the ways we interact with our virtual identities. <\/span><\/p>\n"p3\">"s1\">A few days later, Giselle, Karina, Winter, and Ningning"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/reel\/CdPiEk2BSho\/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=\" target=\"_blank\">climbed the Coachella stage<\/a> in combat boots and miniskirts<\/span>, with"s1\">10 minutes’ worth of music and choreography.

starring in the"https:\/\/time.com\/5921482\/bridgerton-books-netflix\/\" >second season ofBridgerton<\/i><\/a>—the lush period drama that has become Netflix’s"https:\/\/time.com\/6148850\/bridgerton-rege-jean-page-season-2\/\" >most watched English-language series ever<\/a>—the actor Jonathan Bailey could have done anything. He chose something that he knew would be a challenge. “Cock<\/i>!” Bailey says brightly, over lunch on a sunny London afternoon. A woman at a nearby table looks up, possibly scandalized.<\/p>\n"p2\">That’s the name of the play, written by Mike Bartlett, that Bailey, 34, headlines now on the West End, in a sparse, spiky production directed by two-time Tony winner Marianne Elliott. He stars as John, a man in a long-term gay relationship who sleeps with a woman, causing a messy love triangle. It’s a talky play, but Bailey gives a muscular performance, embodying John’s inner turmoil as someone who’s so addicted to being desired that he ends up becoming kind of a—well, it’s in the title. Or is John instead the one being manipulated by those who desire him? “That’s the most generous way into the character,” Bailey says. YetCock<\/i> is more provocative than even its title might suggest, with much to say about sexuality, gender, and the ways in which labels, even the ones we’ve chosen, limit us. “It’s just four people onstage with no set,” he says, “yet it’s one of the most expansive things, emotionally and thematically, I’ve worked on.”<\/p>\n"p2\">Bailey, who was raised in Oxfordshire, England, has been performing since he was a child; he recounts dancing to Andrew Lloyd Webber for his grandmother as a little boy. After being scouted in a ballet class, he went to work for the Royal Shakespeare Company at the age of 7, performing in plays likeA Christmas Carol<\/i> andLes Misérables.<\/i> He loved theater so much that one summer as a teenager, he staged a production ofA Mid-summer Night’s Dream<\/i> with his friends, just for fun: “It was completely generated by passion,” he says. He’s since become an accomplished stage actor, starring opposite Ian McKellen inKing Lear<\/i> and winning an Olivier Award for his performance inCompany<\/i> on the West End, also directed by Elliott. Onscreen, too, he has appeared in a string of acclaimed series, fromBroadchurch<\/i> to shows by beloved creators Phoebe Waller-Bridge and Michaela Coel. But it was the role of Lord Anthony Bridgerton, in the show adapted from Julia Quinn’s Regency-era romance novels, that anointed him as a global star.<\/p>\n"inline-longform_vertical alignnone

His search for a wife became the central story line, leading him into a very different kind of love triangle, here with half-sisters Kate (Simone Ashley) and Edwina (Charithra Chandran); his performance made him the subject of fervent fan adoration. Bailey credits show-runner Chris Van Dusen for building a period drama without precedent. “He proved that you can take two South Indian women and put them on the poster, and you can put a queer actor as a straight romantic lead, and deliver on this incredible global scale,” Bailey says. “It’s a reflection of how we’re moving as a society.”<\/p>\nREAD MORE: <\/strong>"https:\/\/time.com\/6160861\/bridgerton-the-courtship-sanditon-regency-era\/\" >From Bridgerton to Sanditon, We Can’t Quit the Regency Era<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n"p2\">Bridgerton<\/i> is executive-produced by Shonda Rhimes,"https:\/\/time.com\/6132884\/shonda-rhimes-profile\/\" >the TV mastermind and writer-producer<\/a> whose many hit shows have proved that inclusive story-telling isn’t just responsible—it’s good business.

To see Bailey now, as a wholly convincing heartthrob on one of the biggest platforms in the world, is a quietly radical thing, and an auspicious sign of where Hollywood is heading.<\/p>\n"p2\">After lunch, we rent bicycles and ride along the Mall where, ahead, Buckingham Palace looms. It’s a breezy spring day.
Cock<\/i> will close on June 4, after which there have been rumors that the show will find new life, maybe in a move to Broadway, or in a film adaptation. For now, Bailey will have exactly one day off before he returns to set to film the next season ofBridgerton.<\/i> It’s busy, but he’s grateful. “There’s that sense of taking stock, of making sure that I can fully realize all these amazing opportunities,” he says. “It’s something I don’t take lightly at all.”<\/p>\n"p2\">We pause on the banks of the Serpentine. “So,” he says, “where shall we go

center of government. At 14, she graduated from high school; she finished college at 18, and went on to the University of Oxford before working at the World Bank and the U.N.<\/p>\n"p2\">In 2020, Battsengel helped launch the E-Mongolia platform, which has since digitized 650 government services, making it easier for Mongolians to register a company or get a driver’s license. “Now you can access any government service in less than two minutes, and there is no physical contact needed,” she says. This is key in a country where nomadic herders would have to drive hours to accomplish simple tasks.<\/p>\n"p2\">Battsengel is also passionate about making spaces more"https:\/\/time.com\/5878537\/every-girl-has-to-learn-how-to-code-reshma-saujani-wants-to-make-space-for-young-women-in-tech\/\" >welcoming for women<\/a>. “The new inequality is digital exclusion,” she says. In 2021, she founded a Girls for Coding boot camp, which has provided training and laptops to 30 girls from the countryside; she plans to train 50 this year. She hopes that these women can one day walk into work without facing the same questions she did. “We need more female leaders who are younger and dynamic,” she says.<\/p>\n","read_more":true,"section":{"name":"World","slug":"world","url":"https:\/\/time.com\/world\/","description":"The latest news and analysis from TIME's correspondents on world politics,

genre we assign to a life story depends a lot on how it ends. Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva’s life has already completed several dramatic arcs. First, the hero’s journey: a child born into poverty moves to the big city, rises to lead a labor union, and then becomes the most popular President in the history of modern Brazil. Then the tragedy: a celebrated statesman is fingered in a staggering corruption scheme, sent to prison, and forced to watch from the sidelines while rivals dismantle his legacy.<\/p>\n"p2\">The endings don’t seem to stick, though. In April 2021, Brazil’s Supreme Court annulled the corruption convictions that had excluded Lula—as he’s universally known—from politics in 2018,"https:\/\/www.france24.com\/en\/americas\/20210324-brazil-s-supreme-court-rules-judge-moro-was-biased-in-lula-corruption-trial\" target=\"_blank\">saying<\/a> a biased judge on his case had compromised his right to a fair trial.

But he didn’t hesitate to return to frontline politics. “In truth, I never gave up,” he rumbles in his famously gravelly voice, made hoarser by age. “Politics lives in every cell of my body, because I have a cause. And in the 12 years since I left office, I see that all the policies I created to benefit the poor have been destroyed.”<\/p>\n"inline-longform_vertical alignnone \">"lazy\"

Cover<\/em><\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n"p2\">It’s late March, six weeks before Lula launches his campaign, and he’s sitting in a studio in the São Paulo headquarters of his Workers’ Party (PT). Chuckling and griping that no one knows how to design a comfortable chair these days, he comes off as a jovial grandfather. But at his allusion to the current government, his back stiffens and the deeper, gruffer notes of his voice take over. Lula becomes the fiery young union leader he was in the 1970s, and launches into a soapbox-ready tirade.<\/p>\n"p2\">The dream of Brazil that Lula pursued during his presidency from 2003 to 2010 lies in tatters, he says. Through progressive social programs, paid for by a boom in Brazilian products like steel, soy, and oil, Lula’s government lifted millions out of poverty and transformed life for the country’s"https:\/\/time.com\/5915902\/brazil-racism-quilombos\/\" >Black majority<\/a> and"https:\/\/time.com\/5676877\/indigenous-leader-amazon-brazil\/\" >Indigenous minority<\/a>.

Bolsonaro, a defender of the nation’s 20th century military dictatorship, has called mass rallies against judges who displease him and attacked critical journalists. He has also spent months warning of electoral fraud in Brazil, in an echo of President Donald Trump’s behavior before the 2020 U.S. election. In April, he"https:\/\/www.correiobraziliense.com.br\/politica\/2022\/04\/5003734-bolsonaro-defende-suspensao-de-eleicoes-caso-ocorra-algo-anormal.html\" target=\"_blank\">suggested<\/a> elections could be “suspended” if “something abnormal happens.” If he loses, analysts warn, a Brazilian version of a Jan. 6 riot is likely. If he wins, Brazil’s institutions may not withstand another four years of his rule.<\/p>\n"p3\">Riding out of his political exile like a white knight, Lula claims that he can save Brazil from that nightmare. But it may no longer be the same country he once ruled. Its economy is reeling from the pandemic, with double-digit inflation and no commodities boom on the horizon. A six-year political crisis has bitterly divided society. Geopolitical rifts that Brazil once straddled have widened, and the West is in a new hot-and-cold war with Russia.<\/p>\n"p2\">Lula, though, believes lightning will strike twice. “In American football, there is a player—as it happens he’s ended up with a Brazilian model,” he says, referring to Tom Brady and his wife Gisele Bündchen. “He’s been the best player in the world for a long time, but in each game, his fans demand that he plays better than he did in the last one. For me, with the presidency, it’s the same thing. I am only running because I can do better than I did before.”<\/p>\n"inline-longform_large alignnone \">"lazy\"

>Luisa Dörr for TIME<\/span>"caption\" >Lula, who will run in October’s presidential elections, takes part in a labor union event during International Workers’ Day in São Paulo.<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n"p4\">The crowd has<\/strong> been waiting for hours. Children sit restlessly on white plastic chairs, crammed together with their parents under a marquee to keep out the searing midday sun. Many wear red T-shirts with the logo of the Homeless Workers’ Movement (MTST), which fights for public housing and has organized this rally in a parking lot in the working-class outskirts of São Paulo. “It’s been a long time,” Lula finally begins over chants of his name, “that I’ve been missing the microphone.”<\/p>\n"p2\">Neighborhoods like this are Lula’s home turf. When he was 7 years old, in 1952, his mother brought him and his seven siblings from Brazil’s desert-like northeast, traveling two weeks in an open truck bed, to São Paulo. They lived in the back room of a bar, and Lula left school at 12 to help support them. By 17, he was making door handles at a factory, and on one night shift, he lost his left pinkie in a machine. At 23, Lula married a neighbor, Maria de Lourdes. But she died two years later from a hepatitis infection while eight months pregnant with their first son, who also died—victims, Lula would later say, of the low-quality health care offered to Brazil’s poor. A few years later, in 1975, he was elected leader of the Steel Workers’ Union of São Bernardo do Campo, a São Paulo district a few miles from the site of this rally.<\/p>\n"p3\">Many in Brazil know that story, which was immortalized in a"http:\/\/content.time.com\/time\/world\/article\/0,8599,1950540,00.html\" >syrupy 2009 film<\/a>,Lula, Son of Brazil.<\/i> “Lula’s trajectory has a very strong mythic quality for everyone who fights for social justice in Brazil,” says Guilherme Boulos, 39, coordinator of the MTST, who is often considered Lula’s political heir. “But he himself isn’t a distant, ceremonial person. He still speaks the language of the people.” Lula says the secret to his success lies in his ability to relate to working-class Brazilians—an unusual feat in a country where politicians are prone to price-of-milk gaffes. “I feel proud to have proven that a metal-worker without a university diploma is more competent to govern this country than the elite of Brazil,” he says. “Because the art of government is to use your heart, not only your head.”<\/p>\n"inline-longform_large alignnone \">"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/api.time.com\/wp-content\/plugins\/lazy-load-0.7\/images\/1x1.trans.gif\" alt

former army captain devoted to the “says what he really thinks” political style, would probably agree on the importance of connecting emotionally with voters. But Lula’s populism conceals a shrewd pragmatism that has allowed him to navigate Brazil’s choppy political waters. As President, Lula maintained the fiscal conservatism of his center-right predecessor, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, sticking to Brazil’s agreements with the International Monetary Fund and satisfying investors. At the same time, his flagship Bolsa Família program boosted the income of poorer families, while other policies expanded access to education and health care. “If I can tell you that I have a daughter with a law degree, it’s because of programs created by the Lula government,” says Mel Nogueira, 39, at the São Paulo rally. “He represents hope itself.” In 2009, two years before Lula left office with an 83% approval rating, President Barack Obama called him “the most popular politician on earth.”<\/p>\n"p2\">Then it all came crashing down. In 2014, Brazilian investigators uncovered a vast kickbacks-for-contracts scheme, centered on the state oil giant Petrobras, with billions in public funds pilfered. The"https:\/\/time.com\/4135814\/brazil-dilma-rousseff-impeachment\/\" >probe was dubbed Car Wash<\/a>.

He was ahead in the polls when Brazil’s top electoral court ruled that he could not be a candidate. Lula detected the logic of that: “It made no sense to impeach Dilma, if two years later, I would be President again.

President Bolsonaro<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n"p2\">For the Brazilian left, Rousseff’s impeachment amounted to a coup, an attack not on corruption—Car Wash implicated politicians across the political spectrum—but on the social progress that Lula and Rousseff had tried to achieve. Yet some supporters remained unsure about what had taken place under Lula’s watch. “I wish the investigation had convinced me whether he was guilty or innocent,” left-wing filmmaker Petra Costa said in her 2019 documentaryThe Edge of Democracy.<\/i> “But instead, I was seeing prosecutors making a spectacle to present their case.”<\/p>\n"p2\">Lula had spent 18 months in prison when the Supreme Court ruled, in November 2019, that defendants can’t be jailed before exhausting their appeal options. (In April 2022, the U.N.’s human-rights committee said Lula’s trial had been biased and violated due process.)It was a dark period in his life. Publications that had once celebrated his accomplishments were describing him as a criminal. His second wife, of 43 years, Marisa Letícia, had died from a stroke during his prosecution, and while he was in jail his 7-year-old grandson Arthur died of meningitis.<\/p>\n"p3\">Lula deflects questions about his state of mind during that time. He says he drew strength from calls of “Good morning, President” from supporters who maintained a vigil outside the jail. “I was prepared to leave prison without feeling any resentment, only remembering that it was a part of history. I cannot forget it,” he says. “But I can’t put it on the table every day. I want to think about the future.”<\/p>\n"p1\">"time-diptyche-shortcode\"><\/div><\/p>\n"p5\">For all his<\/strong> talk of the future, Lula’s campaign has so far run on nostalgia. When he was President, his Facebook ads point out,"https:\/\/m.facebook.com\/Lula\/photos\/a.328598417209165\/4746598012075828\/?type=3&source=57\" target=\"_blank\">unemployment was lower<\/a>,"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/photo\/?fbid=541518240668530&set=a.532393174914370\" target=\"_blank\">wages were higher<\/a>, and"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pt.brasil\/posts\/2026318690787829\/\" target=\"_blank\">fuel was cheap<\/a>. “Lula hasn’t really presented a plan for the future. For the time being, he is only presenting the idea that he was a better President than Bolsonaro,” says Thomas Traumann, a political consultant and former Brazilian communications secretary.<\/p>\n"p2\">Bolsonaro’s pandemic mismanagement and attacks on democratic institutions have allowed Lula to command a broad unity coalition. Geraldo Alckmin, a center-right former São Paulo governor who was Lula’s rival in the 2006 election, will be his running mate. Other former critics are backing his campaign, including Felipe Neto, a popular YouTuber who was a fierce voice against the PT during the Car Wash probe. “I’m not a member of the PT, and I have hard criticism about a lot of matters related to Lula. But those criticisms are in the political field, not about human rights,” he says. “I would like to oppose a legitimate leader; I can’t stand doing it against a murderer any longer.”<\/p>\n"p2\">In a country where per capita GDP has been cut almost in half since 2014, even elites, many of whom supported Bolsonaro in 2018, have warmed to the idea that Lula may be better for business. “I am the only candidate with whom people should not be concerned about [economic policy],” Lula says. “Because I’ve been a President twice already. We don’t discuss economic policies before winning the elections. First, you have to win the elections.” That will come as a surprise to many, since the economy has usually been at the center of Brazil’s presidential campaigns. But Lula doubles down, citing stats from Brazil’s 2000s boom. “You have to understand that instead of asking what I will do, just look at what I’ve done.”<\/p>\n"p2\">If he wins, though, Lula would inherit a darker economic outlook than he did in 2003. “It’s hard to quantify how much of the economic success of Lula’s first administration was due to the incredible conditions that he was fortunate to have,” says Gustavo Ribeiro, a political analyst. “It’s going to be a much more daunting task ahead of him.”<\/p>\n"inline-longform_vertical alignnone \">"lazy\"

most evident in the issue of oil. During the PT’s rule, offshore discoveries by Petrobras bolstered state budgets and kept fuel prices low in Brazil. Today the global oil price is surging, driving inflation in Brazil, while efforts to"https:\/\/time.com\/5956519\/brazil-biden-climate-change\/\" >fight the climate crisis<\/a> have cast a shadow over the future of the oil sector, which"https:\/\/oec.world\/en\/profile\/country\/bra\" target=\"_blank\">makes up 11.5%<\/a> of Brazil’s exports. In Colombia, Gustavo Petro, the left-wing front runner in its upcoming election, has pledged an immediate halt to oil exploration in his country—in line with recommendations of the International Energy Agency. He"https:\/\/time.com\/6139508\/gustavo-petro-anti-oil-bloc\/\" >expressed hope<\/a> that Lula and other progressive allies would join him in an anti-oil bloc.<\/p>\nRead More:<\/strong>"https:\/\/time.com\/amazon-rainforest-disappearing\/\" >The Amazon Rain Forest Is Nearly Gone. We Went to the Front Lines to See If It Could Be Saved<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n"p3\">Lula’s response will disappoint environmentalists. “Look, Petro has the right to propose whatever he wants. But in the case of Brazil, this is not for real,” he says. “In the case of the world, it’s not for real.” Might he stop exploration for new oil deposits while extracting the oil Brazil has already located? “No, as long as you don’t have alternative energy, you will continue to use the energy that you have.”<\/p>\n"p2\">Though Lula says his administration would scale up Brazil’s production of clean energy, he has also pledged to invest in new oil-refinery infrastructure in an effort to decouple Brazil’s oil from the global market. He frames it as a sovereignty issue. “Think of"https:\/\/time.com\/6153184\/ukraine-crisis-scrambled-germanys-energy-politics\/\" >our dear Germany<\/a>: Angela Merkel decided to close all the"https:\/\/time.com\/6169164\/ukraine-nuclear-energy-europe\/\" >nuclear power plants<\/a>. She did not count on the war in Ukraine. And today, Europe depends on Russia for energy.”<\/p>\n"p2\">Lula’s views on foreign policy put him against the prevailing wind today. As President, he refused to take a side in the West’s arguments with its rivals, and prided himself on speaking with Venezuela’s Hugo Chávez or Iran’s Mahmoud Ahmadinejad the same week as George W. Bush or Barack Obama. He says he was “very concerned” when the U.S. and many Latin American countries recognized"https:\/\/time.com\/5518443\/juan-guaido-interview-venezuela\/\" >Juan Guaidó,<\/a> Venezuela’s center-left opposition leader, as President in 2019, in a bid to force Nicolás Maduro,"https:\/\/time.com\/5918527\/venezuela-parliamentary-elections-maduro\/\" >Chávez’s authoritarian successor<\/a>, from power. Even today, after Venezuela’s collapse into kleptocracy, Lula refuses to call Maduro a dictator.<\/p>\n"p2\">Lula remains a die-hard believer that “two elected heads of state, sitting at a table, looking each other in the eye,” can resolve any differences. He claims that President Joe Biden and"https:\/\/time.com\/6170974\/olaf-scholz-germany-interview\/\" >E.U. leaders<\/a> failed to do that enough in the run-up to Russia’s invasion of its neighbor in February. “The United States has a lot of political clout. And Biden could have avoided [the war], not incited it,” he says. “He could have participated more. Biden could have taken a plane to Moscow to talk to Putin.

But in Lula’s view, even"https:\/\/time.com\/6171277\/volodymyr-zelensky-interview-ukraine-war\/\" >Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky<\/a>, who faced a months-long buildup of troops at his borders before the outbreak of war in February, shares blame. “I see the President of Ukraine, speaking on television, being applauded, getting a standing ovation by all the [European] parliamentarians,” he says, shaking his head angrily. “This guy is as responsible as Putin for the war. Because in the war, there’s not just one person guilty.” He argues that it is irresponsible for Western leaders to celebrate Zelensky rather than focusing on closed-door negotiations. “You are encouraging this guy, and then he thinks he is the cherry on your cake. We should be having a serious conversation. OK, you were a nice comedian. But let us not make war for you to show up on TV.”<\/p>\nRead More: <\/strong>"https:\/\/time.com\/6171277\/volodymyr-zelensky-interview-ukraine-war\/\" >Inside Zelensky’s World<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n"p3\">The U.S. and the E.U. should have assured Putin that"https:\/\/time.com\/6151115\/nato-russia-ukraine-article-4\/\" >Ukraine would not join NATO<\/a>, Lula says, drawing a comparison with the 1962 Cuban missile crisis, when the U.S. and Russia agreed to remove missile deployments from each other’s backyards. Western sanctions on Russia have unfairly impacted other regions’ economies, he adds. “War is no solution,” he says. “And now we are going to have to foot the bill because of the war on Ukraine. Argentina, Bolivia will also have to pay. You’re not punishing Putin. You’re punishing many different countries, you’re punishing mankind.”<\/p>\n"p2\">The conflict underscores the need to renew global institutions, he says. “Today’s United Nations doesn’t represent anything anymore. Governments don’t take the U.N. seriously today, because they make decisions without respecting it,” Lula says. “We need to create a new global governance.” However difficult that may be in today’s fractured world, many leaders and diplomats would welcome Lula’s return: over the past four years, Bolsonaro has burned countless bridges, angering China with racist jokes about COVID-19 and"https:\/\/time.com\/5658418\/europe-brazil-amazon-deforestation-tension\/\" >mocking E.U. leaders.<\/a> “Brazil will again become a protagonist on the international stage,” Lula pledges, “and we will prove that it’s possible to have a better world.”<\/p>\n"p4\">If Lula’s stance on Ukraine, or his refusal to acknowledge any corruption-related mistakes by his party, suggest stubbornness, his supporters say he is willing to evolve where it matters.<\/p>\n"p2\">For example, Brazil’s conversation on systemic racism has advanced since 2010. According to Douglas Belchior, an organizer for the nation’s Black Coalition for Rights, Lula’s antipoverty and education-access programs gave him a strong record on improving"https:\/\/time.com\/6046299\/fighting-injustice-world\/\" >life for Black and mixed-race Brazilians<\/a>, who make up 56% of the population and 75% of the country’s poorest. But today, Black and Indigenous Brazilians are"https:\/\/time.com\/5867784\/black-domestic-workers-treatment-brazil\/\" >calling for more targeted action<\/a> to undo the pervasive legacy of slavery and colonialism. Lula’s next administration will need to put more emphasis on antiracism, and correct “some serious failings” by past PT governments on policing, Belchior says. “Going back to the point immediately before Bolsonaro isn’t enough for us. We have to move forward from where the PT governments stopped,” he says. “And Lula has listened to many Black activists, intellectuals, and politicians.

Though Lula is less ambitious about phasing out fossil fuels, his administrations were successful in curbing deforestation. Now he is centering the shifts Brazil needs to make on food to fight climate change—arguably more important in a country where"https:\/\/ourworldindata.org\/grapher\/ghg-emissions-by-sector?time=latest&country=~BRA\" target=\"_blank\">agriculture and land use make up 61.5%<\/a> of annual greenhouse-gas emissions. “I have improved how I speak. Now I’m not only talking about [ensuring that people can afford] a barbecue, but also about vegetarians,” he tweeted in February. “So we can stimulate a healthier agriculture in our country.”<\/p>\n"p2\">Brazilian media"https:\/\/veja.abril.com.br\/coluna\/maquiavel\/tres-pautas-que-janja-noiva-de-lula-incluiu-na-agenda-do-petista\/\" target=\"_blank\">attributes some of Lula’s new talking points<\/a>—which also include an emphasis on gender equality and animal rights—to the influence of his fiancée Rosângela da Silva (no relation). In 2019, Lula announced his engagement to da Silva, a 55-year-old sociologist and PT activist, and they plan to wed in May. He’s hesitant to talk about her—“She can speak for herself!”—but he has “learned from her,” he says. “When you lose your wife, you think, well, my life has no more meaning. Then suddenly this person appears who makes you feel like you want to live again. I’m in love as if I were 20 years old, as if it were my first girlfriend.”<\/p>\n"p2\">Lula believes the marriage will shape the tone of his next political chapter. “A guy as happy as I am doesn’t have to rage—let your opponents do what they want,” he says. “If I can, on the campaign, I will speak only about love. I don’t think it’s possible to be a good President if you only feel hate inside you, if all you want is revenge. No, the past is over. I will build a new Brazil.”<\/p>\n"p2\">With reporting by<\/i>Eloise

They’ve grown even stronger in the past two years, thanks to disinformation about the COVID-19 vaccines. Though the development of the COVID-19 vaccines happened at an unprecedented pace, they’ve been rigorously tested, and have proven both safe and effective. Nevertheless, falsehoods about them—that the vaccines contained microchips, that they would alter the DNA of recipients or cause them to become magnetic—have spread.<\/p>\nPublic-health experts feared that those groundless claims would exacerbate mistrust among people who already doubted vaccines or serve as a gateway into vaccine skepticism among people who previously had no such concerns. Now it appears those fears might have been well-placed. In April, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)"https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/mmwr\/volumes\/71\/wr\/mm7116a1.htm\" target=\"_blank\">published a study<\/a> showing that during the 2020-2021 school year, rates of routine vaccinations among the nation’s 3.52 million enrolled kindergarteners fell below the 95% level necessary to ensure herd immunity. The average drop from the"https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/mmwr\/volumes\/70\/wr\/mm7003a2.htm\" target=\"_blank\">rates during the 2019-2020 school year<\/a> was small, just over 1% for each of three vaccines. But CDC researchers say that is enough to allow viruses to gain a foothold in the overall community of kids, many of whom may be unable to be vaccinated for medical reasons.<\/p>\nThe researchers cited multiple variables that might have contributed to reduced vaccination rates, including skipped well-child visits during the height of the pandemic and the shuttering of schools, most of which require vaccinations for students to attend. But anti-COVID-19 vaccine beliefs most likely played a part, many experts say.<\/p>\n“I think that segment of the community who’s already mistrusting of the medical community has been re-energized for sure,” says Dr. Gary Kirkilas, a Phoenix-area pediatrician and spokesman for the American Academy of Pediatrics. “We’ve had this politicization of the [COVID-19] vaccine that just leads to more mistrust.”<\/p>\nSo far, the U.S. has been lucky that subpar vaccination rates haven’t yet triggered a rise in routine childhood illnesses. “We haven’t seen outbreaks, and that’s probably representative of the fact that families were staying home during the pandemic,” said Dr. Georgina Peacock, acting director of the CDC’s immunization services, and an author of the recent CDC study, at a press briefing when the findings were released. But now that most kids are back in classrooms, experts worry that epidemics like"https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/measles\/cases-outbreaks.html\" target=\"_blank\">the national measles outbreak of 2019<\/a> are increasingly likely.<\/p>\nGrowing anti-vaccine sentiments<\/strong><\/h3>\nCalifornia had long been a national leader in enforcing vaccine requirements to attend schools;"https:\/\/www.cde.ca.gov\/ls\/he\/hn\/immunization.asp\" target=\"_blank\">in 2015, lawmakers there eliminated personal-belief exemptions<\/a> for parents who did not want to get their children vaccinated. But recently, additional proposed bills to require all businesses to mandate COVID-19 vaccines for their employees, and to add COVID-19 to the list of vaccines for which personal belief exemptions for students are applicable, have not advanced in the state legislature.<\/p>\nChristina Hildebrand has a theory why. For years, she has been lobbying against California state legislation that mandates vaccination as a condition for attending public schools. Before the pandemic, she says, lawmakers were resistant to her arguments, and weary of her lobbying. But since the COVID-19 vaccines were released, Hildebrand says, they seem to be more receptive in the California State Assembly, in Sacramento. “I think it’s because prior to this, legislators didn’t have personal experience with the vaccine issue. Whereas now, every single legislator has had some experience.” She believes that the doubts people are feeling over the COVID-19 vaccine for kids (which studies have shown to be"https:\/\/time.com\/6163099\/covid-19-vaccines-children-setting-record-straight\/\" >safe and effective<\/a>) have spurred more people to rethink routine vaccinations in this age group.<\/p>\nThat’s exactly what concerns experts like Dr. Gerald Harmon, president of the American Medical Association (AMA). “We’ve had three different pandemics,” he says. “The COVID-19 pandemic, the disinformation pandemic, and now the pandemic of distrust. So there is a substantial risk of giving more oxygen to the anti-vaxxer population.”<\/p>\nFalling vaccination rates<\/strong><\/h3>\nThe recent CDC study looked at the change in vaccination rates from 2019-2020 to 2020-2021 for three routine childhood shots:<\/p>\n\nmeasles, mumps, and rubella (MMR), for which vaccination rates fell from 95.2% to 93.9%<\/li>\ndiphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis (DTaP), which fell from 94.9% to 93.6%<\/li>\nvaricella, or chickenpox, which fell from 94.8% to 93.6%<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nThose seemingly small drops below the 95% threshold are troubling, especially when it comes to measles, which is so transmissible that even a point below the 95% herd immunity rate is enough to get the disease spreading widely among the unvaccinated. “Measles is an incredibly contagious childhood, which carries a serious risk of lifetime injury,” says Harmon. In some cases, kids who get measles"https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/measles\/symptoms\/complications.html#:~:text=Subacute%20sclerosing%20panencephalitis%20(SSPE)%20is,fully%20recovered%20from%20the%20illness.\" target=\"_blank\">can develop damage to the central nervous system<\/a> as late as 10 years after the initial infection. Troubling as the national vaccine numbers are, they are far worse in some states. Maryland saw its vaccination rate plummet from an average of 95% for all three vaccines in the 2019-2020 school year to 87.6%, 89.7%, and 87.3% respectively for the MMR, DTaP, and varicella vaccines the following year. Wisconsin saw a 5% drop to about 87.2% for all three shots. The least-vaccinated state in the nation for this age group is Idaho, at just over 86% for all three jabs. That represents a 3% drop from 2019-2020.<\/p>\nSince the CDC last tallied childhood vaccination rates in 2021, schools have reopened—with mandates for vaccinations in place—and visits to pediatricians have increased after a sharp decline. In theory, those two factors mean that the vaccination numbers could recover, but Harmon and Kirkilas are not alone in worrying that the damage done by mistrust and misinformation regarding COVID-19 vaccines could have a lasting impact on the uptake of other vaccines. Indeed, “routine immunization rates have been slow to rebound,” said the"https:\/\/www.aap.org\/en\/pages\/2019-novel-coronavirus-covid-19-infections\/clinical-guidance\/guidance-on-providing-pediatric-well-care-during-covid-19\/\" target=\"_blank\">American Academy of Pediatrics<\/a> in January 2022.<\/p>\nFrancesco Pierri, a postdoctoral student at the Polytechnic University of Milan and lead author of"https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41598-022-10070-w\" target=\"_blank\">an April study published<\/a> inNature Scientific Reports<\/em> that correlated COVID-19 vaccine misinformation posted on Twitter and negative attitudes in surveys about the shots, believes that the low childhood vaccination rates may well be tied to unfounded COVID-19 vaccine rumors.<\/p>\n“You can assume some spillover effect,” he says. “The activity around this kind of malicious content has increased, [leading to] an increase in the prevalence of misinformation of vaccines in general.”<\/p>\nSays Harmon, the AMA president, and a former Major General in the Air Force Reserve and the Air National Guard: “One of the things I learned in the military was that the way to overcome resistance is to maintain overwhelming competence.

It all begs the question: why?<\/span><\/p>\n"font-weight: 400;\">TikTok representatives declined to speak for this story. But plenty of those who monitor the app have theories as to why videos supporting Depp have taken over TikTok. <\/span><\/p>\n"font-weight: 400;\">“TikTok is always a great amplifier for cultural moments,” says Abbie Richards, a research fellow at the Accelerationist Research Consortium and a mis- and disinformation researcher who specializes in how content travels on TikTok. “If you engage with one video about the topic, the algorithm learns that you like it and will continue to feed you similar—or even related—videos.”<\/span><\/p>\nRead more:<\/strong>"https:\/\/time.com\/6171006\/johnny-depp-amber-heard-trial\/\" >What to Know About Johnny Depp and Amber Heard’s Defamation Trial<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n"font-weight: 400;\">Like traditional media, TikTok has been overwhelmed with footage from and coverage of the trial. Several news networks have hosted livestreams within the app covering what unfolds each day in the courtroom, <\/span>"font-weight: 400;\">which increases awareness of and engagement with the trial. That triggers a gold rush for other creators to participate in a conversation that appears to be dominating the app, creating a flywheel of more content. One of the key commodities on TikTok is the virality of its memes: users see a particular type of video, or a certain piece of audio, and produce something similar in order to try and capitalize on its popularity. In this instance, the trial itself has become a meme. “Whether you are part of Depp’s fanbase or not, the rush to join the conversation about Depp is highly motivated by algorithmic amplification and the golden ticket to the For You page,” says Tom Divon, visual communication researcher at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.<\/span><\/p>\n"font-weight: 400;\">There’s also the fact that Depp is highly beloved by his digital fanbase, not least because of his role in the <\/span>"font-weight: 400;\">Harry Potter<\/span><\/i>"font-weight: 400;\"> and <\/span>"font-weight: 400;\">Pirates of the Caribbean <\/span><\/i>"font-weight: 400;\">franchises. While the #justiceforjohnnydepp hashtag is closing in on 6 billion views, <\/span>"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/tag\/justiceforamberheard\" target=\"_blank\">"font-weight: 400;\">#justiceforamberheard<\/span><\/a>"font-weight: 400;\"> is limping along at 21 million. “What we’re seeing at play in the anger against Amber Heard has a couple of layers,” says Georgie Carroll, an Australian academic who studies the relationship between online creators and their audience. “This is not something that’s representative of all fans or fandom, but we do always see a certain level of dislike and distrust levelled against the partners of popular male celebrities. Fans often think a female partner isn’t ‘good enough’ for their favourite celebrity, or hold on to a far-off hope that it should actually be them.”<\/span><\/p>\n"font-weight: 400;\">Besides the viral momentum of a live news event that many feel they have a stake in, featuring highly-recognizable celebrities with devoted fanbases, the Depp-Heard trial also taps into a third accelerant to guarantee its success: cybersleuthing TikTok. While the idea of amateur sleuths using the internet to collaborate on research projects has been around for years, the movement has been given an impetus by the snackable, immersive nature of TikTok videos. Perhaps most famously, <\/span>"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/@robandhaley\/video\/7009783672324820229\" target=\"_blank\">"font-weight: 400;\">TikTok users claim credit for helping discover<\/span><\/a>"font-weight: 400;\"> the body of van-life influencer Gabby Petito after she disappeared in August 2021. TikTok sleuths pored over available open-source evidence, claiming that Petito’s fiancé Brian Laundrie was responsible for her murder.<\/span><\/p>\n"font-weight: 400;\">A similar impetus drove TikTok’s crowdsourced investigation of West End Caleb, a New York furniture designer alleged to have ghosted several women—and appears to be in part responsible for perpetuating content around the Depp-Heard trial. “The phenomenon of West Elm Caleb wasn’t just that a few girls posted about their experiences with him. It was the snowballing of those posts, then posts about it, then memes, then meta memes about the memes, then articles and discourse off the app,” says Richards. “The thing spirals into a massive cultural moment.”<\/span><\/p>\n"font-weight: 400;\">That’s happening around the current trial, too. Users are <\/span>"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/@johnnydepp80s\/video\/7089952903691046150?referer_url=https%3A%2F%2Fnypost.com%2F2022%2F04%2F27%2Ftiktok-thinks-amber-heard-lawyer-is-secret-johnny-depp-fan%2F&referer_video_id=7089952903691046150&refer=embed\" target=\"_blank\">"font-weight: 400;\">exchanging pet theories<\/span><\/a>"font-weight: 400;\"> that revolve around someone who looks like Heard’s attorney, Elaine Bredhehoft, appearing in the crowd at a red carpet event for Depp’s 2013 movie <\/span>"font-weight: 400;\">The Lone Ranger<\/span><\/i>"font-weight: 400;\">. A video outlining the theory, which has nearly 15 million views on TikTok, has been shared 42,000 times. It’s just one of many recapping the trial.<\/span><\/p>\n"font-weight: 400;\">The scale of content is understandable, says Carroll—as is the passion felt by both individuals’ fanbases. “When a celebrity is involved in a controversy—regardless of whether something is alleged or proven—our modern social media sphere means there’s immediately an immense pressure to renounce any affection you ever held for them,” she says.

The report, which detailed how the university profited from the sale of 272 enslaved people in 1838, recommended steps for the university to atone for its role. For Blass, it became a factor in her decision to enroll at the university, which she saw as “an educational institution where a Black student like myself could thrive.” <\/span><\/p>\n"font-weight: 400;\">“If they’re dealing with their history in this capacity,” Blass remembers her family thinking, “that means that they’re doing something above and beyond, and that can probably spell something positive for the campus culture.”<\/span><\/p>\n"font-weight: 400;\">But while Blass, now a graduating senior, did thrive on campus, she has also spent the last four years pressuring the university to do more to repay descendants for what was taken from their enslaved ancestors. <\/span><\/p>\n"font-weight: 400;\">“The existence of these individuals and their work [permeates] the entire Georgetown experience, even if you’re not directly looking for it. That’s a debt owed,” says Blass, who was, until recently, the school’s student body president. “There is direct economic harm to be found there.”<\/span><\/p>\nRead more: <\/strong><\/em>"https:\/\/time.com\/5013728\/slavery-universities-america\/\" >3 Ways America’s Elite Universities Benefited From Slavery<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n"font-weight: 400;\">Last week, Harvard become the most recent and one of the most prominent universities to reckon with its own complicity in slavery, acknowledging that university presidents, faculty, and staff enslaved more than 70 people in the years from 1636 to 1783, when the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled that slavery was unlawful. <\/span><\/p>\n"font-weight: 400;\">“Enslaved men and women served Harvard presidents and professors and fed and cared for Harvard students,” stated <\/span>"https:\/\/legacyofslavery.harvard.edu\/report\/introduction-and-findings#slavery-in-the-north\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">"font-weight: 400;\">the Harvard report<\/span><\/a>"font-weight: 400;\">, released on April 26. “Moreover, throughout this period and well into the 19th century, the University and its donors benefited from extensive financial ties to slavery.”<\/span><\/p>\n"font-weight: 400;\">“I believe we bear a moral responsibility to do what we can to address the persistent corrosive effects of those historical practices on individuals, on Harvard, and on our society,” Harvard President Lawrence Bacow said in a <\/span>"https:\/\/legacyofslavery.harvard.edu\/about\/aboutmessage-from-president\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">"font-weight: 400;\">letter<\/span><\/a>"font-weight: 400;\"> to the school community. <\/span><\/p>\n"font-weight: 400;\">The university pledged to spend $100 million toward a “Legacy of Slavery Fund” that will support the continued study of Harvard’s ties to slavery and will be used to implement other measures <\/span>"https:\/\/legacyofslavery.harvard.edu\/report\/recommendations-to-the-president-and-fellows-of-harvard-college\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">"font-weight: 400;\">recommended<\/span><\/a>"font-weight: 400;\"> by the report—including that Harvard honor the labor of enslaved people with a memorial on campus; develop partnerships with Historically Black Colleges and Universities; and improve educational access through partnerships with local colleges and nonprofits, to confront “enduring inequities that impact descendant communities in the United States.”\/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n"font-weight: 400;\">The report also recommended that Harvard identify the descendants of people enslaved by Harvard’s leaders, faculty, and staff and “engage with these descendants through dialogue, programming, information sharing, relationship building, and educational support.” But it stops short of calling for direct financial reparations to those descendants.<\/span><\/p>\n"font-weight: 400;\">Some experts argue that’s a missed opportunity for one of the country’s wealthiest universities—Harvard has a <\/span>"https:\/\/apnews.com\/article\/business-education-philanthropy-endowments-higher-education-51d411e8d3882ac38c97a22209d6ee7d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">"font-weight: 400;\">$53 billion endowment<\/span><\/a>"font-weight: 400;\">—to make a more meaningful difference for victims of slavery and their descendants. Advocates for financial reparations argue it’s a step that would help to address the lasting inequities that can be traced back to slavery in the United States, including the persistent racial wealth gap and under-representation of Black students in higher education. In 2016, the median white household had nearly 10 times the wealth of the median Black household,"https:\/\/www.brookings.edu\/blog\/up-front\/2020\/02\/27\/examining-the-black-white-wealth-gap\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">according to Brookings<\/a>. And while about 12% of the U.S. population is Black, just 7% of students at both Harvard and Georgetown were Black in fall 2020, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. <\/span><\/p>\n"font-weight: 400;\">“The institution and individuals in the institution were paid for their role in the buying, selling, trading of slaves,” says Andre Perry, a senior fellow at Brookings Metro, who has written about inequality and reparations in education. “Cash was exchanged. So at some point, you should cut a check to the descendants of those who were burdened by those actions.”<\/span><\/p>\nSo if $100 million sounds like a lot, Perry says, it’s still “somewhat of an insult” considering what the institution can afford.<\/p>\n"font-weight: 400;\">To Perry, direct impact in the form of reparations would be all the more meaningful because, while honest acknowledgement of an institution’s involvement in slavery is a step in the right direction, he thinks similar reports released at other universities have thus far had a “minimal impact” on the individual descendants of those who were enslaved. <\/span><\/p>\nRead more: <\/strong><\/em>"https:\/\/time.com\/4492871\/slavery-history-college-campuses\/\" >Slavery on America’s College Campuses Went Beyond Buying and Selling<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n"font-weight: 400;\">Take Georgetown: The Jesuit-founded school in Washington, D.C., acknowledged that it profited off the sale of enslaved people and pledged to give an admissions advantage to their descendants—similar to the admissions advantage offered to children of Georgetown faculty, staff and alumni. <\/span>"font-weight: 400;\">The university has admitted 16 descendants of enslaved people to undergraduate and graduate programs since 2016, a spokesperson for Georgetown said.

After all, it was the Society of Jesus that enslaved my ancestors for the benefit of Georgetown College.”<\/div>\n"font-weight: 400;\">Last year, students at Brown University also voted overwhelmingly in favor of the university identifying descendants of those who were enslaved at the university and paying them reparations. In November, the school released an update to its <\/span>"https:\/\/slaveryandjustice.brown.edu\/sites\/default\/files\/reports\/SlaveryAndJustice2006.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">"font-weight: 400;\">2006 report<\/span><\/a>"font-weight: 400;\"> about its ties to slavery, but did not take action on the student referendum<\/span>"font-weight: 400;\">. <\/span><\/p>\n"font-weight: 400;\">“<\/span>"font-weight: 400;\">There is no active process underway to identify descendants or pay reparations, but it’s a question that continues to be relevant,” Brian Clark, a spokesperson for Brown, said in an email, adding that the university is committed to remembering and addressing issues of injustice in its teaching, research, admissions, and hiring practices.<\/span><\/p>\n"font-weight: 400;\">William Darity, a public policy professor at Duke University who studies racial inequality and the economics of reparations, notes that most universities that have studied their own historical involvement with slavery have not gone much further in their responses than renaming buildings, removing Confederate statues, or erecting memorials to the contributions of enslaved people. But, while he says those moves just scratch the surface of what would be a commensurate response, he believes such a solution won’t be found in a piecemeal approach from a handful of universities.

David Lazer, co-author of the COVID States Project survey and a professor of political and computer sciences at Northeastern University, says he was surprised by his group’s findings; he expected more than 30% of people to skip the secondary test. At this point in the pandemic, he suspects that the real number is higher, since people are increasingly comfortable with at-home tests and it’s growing harder to find free testing sites.<\/p>\n“There’s every reason to believe that the missingness is much, much larger now than it was in January,” Lazer says.<\/p>\nThat’s a problem, health experts agree. Along with"https:\/\/time.com\/6145220\/covid-19-wastewater-tracker\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wastewater surveillance<\/a> and hospitalization rates, testing data is one of the major ways public health officials track the virus’ spread and look for potential surges and hotspots. Agencies including the CDC have said measures like mask mandates can be applied fluidly depending on current transmission patterns in a given area. But if health officials don’t have an accurate picture of where the virus is spreading, they won’t be able to use appropriate mitigation strategies.<\/p>\nA national reporting system for home-test data could help solve that problem—but the question is how to make one work, and whether it’s the best use of increasingly strained public-health resources.<\/p>\nRead More<\/strong>:"https:\/\/time.com\/6168672\/how-wearing-mask-protects-you\/\" >How Wearing a Mask Can Help Protect You Even If No One Else Wears One <\/em><\/a><\/p>\nThe mixed blessing of home tests <\/strong><\/h2>\nDr. Michael Mina, chief science officer at the remote testing company eMed, has long argued that rapid tests are crucial to controlling the pandemic. Quickly swabbing before travel or social events, for example, can prevent people from unknowingly infecting others. It’s great that people are finally using self-tests regularly, Mina says, but it’s time to better track the resulting data.<\/p>\n“Two years ago,"https:\/\/time.com\/5912705\/covid-19-stop-spread-christmas\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">I was pushing for at-home tests<\/a> regardless of reporting, out of this massive urgency and need” for better prevention tools, he says. “Now, we’ve had two years to catch up.”<\/p>\nThe need for better tracking is clear. During the Omicron wave, about 20% of people in the U.S. who had COVID-like symptoms used an at-home test,"https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/mmwr\/volumes\/71\/wr\/mm7113e1.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">according to CDC data<\/a>. Now, people are testing at home more than ever. For the first time during the pandemic, more people tested positive on at-home tests than other types of tests during the week ending April 16, according to new data from researchers at Boston Children’s Hospital and survey company Momentive (which has not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal). About 58% of the positive cases reported by the 474,000 people surveyed were picked up by an at-home test.<\/p>\nThat’s better for individuals because it’s convenient, says John Brownstein, chief innovation officer at Boston Children’s Hospital. “But it’s not better for public health, because public-health data relies on detailed reporting.”<\/p>\nMany at-home test kits include a way to voluntarily report results to the manufacturer, often by downloading an app; the company may then choose to share the results with public-health officials. But few people use that option. Through a pilot program run by the CDC and the U.S. National Institutes of Health, more than 1.4 million DIY tests were distributed to households in Tennessee and Michigan in 2021—but"https:\/\/www.healthaffairs.org\/do\/10.1377\/forefront.20220209.919199\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">fewer than 10,000 test results were later logged in a companion app<\/a>, according to an article inHealth Affairs.<\/em><\/p>\nRead More<\/strong>:"https:\/\/time.com\/6168141\/first-covid-19-breathalyzer-test\/\" >The First COVID-19 Breathalyzer Test Is Coming to the U.S.<\/em><\/a><\/p>\nSimilarly, only about 5,700 people have reported a positive result through Washington State’s hotline since August 2021, a health department representative told TIME. That, too, represents a tiny fraction of the tests taken during that time frame; during the peak of the Omicron surge, the state was recording thousands of cases every day.<\/p>\nThe search for a better system<\/strong><\/h2>\nIt would be technologically easy for the CDC or another U.S. government agency to build a website where users could quickly log their at-home diagnoses. Brownstein’s research group already runs"https:\/\/outbreaksnearme.org\/us\/en-US\/testing\" target=\"_blank\">such a <\/a>"https:\/\/outbreaksnearme.org\/us\/en-US\/testing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">website<\/a> to “put the ‘public’ back in public health,” he says. Crowdsourcing data benefits individuals as well as researchers, because “you get a disease weather map, where you can understand what’s going on and make decisions for yourself and your family.”<\/p>\nBut using that approach to inform federal statistics is risky, Lazer says, because a couple of “bad apples” could choose to falsely report many cases and skew the data. And without knowing how many total tests have been taken, it’s hard to know the significance of the few results that are reported, Mina says. (Brownstein, however, thinks there’s value in a national surveillance site, even without 100% participation. “Not many people [write Amazon reviews], but there are enough people who are willing to give you a sense of the value of a product,” he says.)<\/p>\nFor more people to opt in to a reporting system, they would need a reason beyond being a “Good Samaritan,” Mina says. His company, eMed, is trying to incentivize self-reporting. After someone uses an eMed-compatible home test, the company generates a lab report that is shared with public-health departments. That also benefits the individual, Mina says, because they can use the report to be cleared for"https:\/\/time.com\/6166457\/covid-19-test-positive-while-traveling\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">travel<\/a>, work, or school if they’re negative. If they’re positive, they have proof of that result and will be connected by telemedicine to a doctor who can prescribe treatment. Those may be better motivators for the average person than simply contributing to statistics, Mina says.<\/p>\nPublic-health officials should also take advantage of existing tools by working with diagnostics companies to make their self-reporting systems easier and more accessible, Brownstein says. Instead of downloading an app, for example, people could send in their results via text message.<\/p>\nAnother option, Lazer says, would be to conduct repeated, large surveys of American households, asking if anyone in the home recently tested positive for COVID-19 and, if so, on which type of test.<\/p>\nA problem bigger than self tests<\/strong><\/h2>\nTo Beth Blauer, executive director of the Centers for Civic Impact at Johns Hopkins University and an expert on government data systems, the data problem in the U.S. involves more than at-home tests. Two years into the pandemic, states still don’t have a standardized way of collecting and assessing the test results they get from testing sites, which means federal case and testing data is flawed even before considering the missing data from unlogged rapid tests, she says.<\/p>\nThe situation is especially bad now that some public testing sites are shutting down and uninsured people can no longer get tested for free, Blauer adds. Some people might test at home instead, but many won’t. Data show that"https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/mmwr\/volumes\/71\/wr\/mm7113e1.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">home testing is most common among those who are fairly young, white, highly educated, and wealthy<\/a>—perhaps unsurprising, given that each test costs about $10. Many people, especially those from underserved communities, simply won’t get tested if they can’t get a free diagnostic through work, school, or a convenient public test site, Blauer says, which means many cases will never be detected.<\/p>\n“If COVID has taught us anything, it’s that we have to be much more agile in the way that we dial up and dial down public-health interventions,” Blauer says. “As we dilute that data, it becomes harder and harder to be agile.”<\/p>\nFinding ways to include at-home test data in official case counts could make a dent in that problem. But that will only work if everyone has access to at-home tests and knows what to do with the information they reveal, says Benjamin Rader, a graduate research fellow at Boston Children’s Hospital.<\/p>\n“When we try to create a comprehensive surveillance system, it’s imperative that we make sure we’re reaching everyone in society,” Rader says. “We need to make sure we’re doing things to target everyone and not miss pockets of the U.S.”<\/p>\n","read_more":true,"section":{"name":"Health","slug":"health","url":"https:\/\/time.com\/health\/","description":"The latest health news, trends, and commentary from TIME, covering medicine, mental health, diet, fitness, sex, aging, disease, healthcare, policy and more","health":true,"all_sections":["time-section-health"]},"tag":{"name":"COVID-19","slug":"covid-19","url":"https:\/\/time.com\/tag\/covid-19\/"},"tags":"COVID-19|healthscienceclimate","hero":{"class":"landscape","thumbnail":"https:\/\/api.time.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/home-covid-tests.jpg?quality=85&w=100&h=100&crop=1","src":{"small":"https:\/\/api.time.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/home-covid-tests.jpg?quality=85&w=280","small_2x":"https:\/\/api.time.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/home-covid-tests.jpg?quality=85&w=560","landscape_large":"https:\/\/api.time.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/home-covid-tests.jpg?quality=85&crop=0px%2C3px%2C1024px%2C683px&resize=550%2C367&strip","large":"https:\/\/api.time.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/home-covid-tests.jpg?quality=85&w=550","large_2x":"https:\/\/api.time.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/home-covid-tests.jpg?quality=85&w=1024","square":"https:\/\/api.time.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/home-covid-tests.jpg?quality=85&w=600&h=600&crop=1"},"credit":"Paul Hennessy\u2014SOPA Images\/LightRocket\/Getty Images","caption":"At-home COVID-19 test kits on a shelf at a Walmart in Orlando, Fla.

The state’s lieutenant governor—6 ft. 8 in., bald and goateed, wearing his trademark Carhartt sweatshirt and athletic shorts—doesn’t bother with his stump speech right away. Instead, he starts working the crowd. He asks if they’re Eagles fans or Steelers fans; crows, “Shorts, 365!” to another year-round-shorts guy; kneels on the ground to accept a “lucky penny” from a little girl; and takes photos with arms so long he calls them “selfie sticks.”<\/p>\nFetterman is the front runner in Pennsylvania’s May 17 Democratic"https:\/\/www.nbcnews.com\/politics\/2022-election\/fetterman-says-just-democrat-moves-closer-senate-nomination-rcna22809\" target=\"_blank\">Senate primary<\/a>, a marquee race that could have been a microcosm of the split within the party.

Yet Fetterman is the clear favorite for the nomination, boasting huge leads in the"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/fetterman-oz-mccormick-lead-pennsylvania-senate-democratic-republican-primaries-poll-2022-5\" target=\"_blank\">polls<\/a> and a big cash advantage, thanks to his base of small-dollar donors.<\/p>\nThe day after his brewery visit, Fetterman explains his philosophy to me over hot dogs with mustard and onions. He thinks the left-vs.-moderate divide that dominates Democratic strategy discussions is largely a Washington paradigm; that normal people don’t care about policy positions as much as political wonks think they do; and that Pennsylvania voters mostly want somebody who bothers to travel to the far reaches of the state to meet them. “I just show up,” he says, squeezed into a booth at Yocco’s Hot Dogs near Bethlehem. “And I just try to be me.” The voters he meets make their decisions based on a “visceral” feeling, he says, that “it’s someone they believe is a good person or gonna be honest at the end of the day.”<\/p>\nRead More: <\/strong>"https:\/\/time.com\/6173552\/democratic-party-grassroots-abortion\/\" >The End of Roe Could Galvanize Democrats’ Burned-Out Base<\/a>.<\/em><\/p>\nIn recent elections, Democrats have focused on turning out Black and young voters while winning the suburbs. Fetterman is the rare Democrat who sees white working-class and rural voters as a key part of a winning coalition. He thinks many GOP areas are more magenta than ruby red. “We cannot afford to cede a county 80\/20, like has been done in the past,” he tells the crowd in Easton. He spent the second-to-last weekend of the primary campaign in five counties that Trump won by at least 35 points.<\/p>\nFetterman doesn’t expect the hardcore MAGA crowd to vote for him. “Some people think it’s about trying to go in and have some mass conversion by laying hands on Republicans,” he says. “That’s not gonna happen.” But “there are plenty of people in Pennsylvania that are open to the argument,” he adds. “And if you don’t make it, then you can’t blame them.”<\/p>\nA few hours<\/strong> after our hot dog lunch, Fetterman lumbers into the United Steelworkers union in Bethlehem. A leak from the ceiling drips into a plastic garbage can. In the distance, the old Bethlehem Steel mill looms over the town like an abandoned cathedral; it’s now a music venue adjacent to a casino. “We need to keep making sh-t in this country,” Fetterman says, vowing to protect what he calls the “union way of life.” As United Steelworkers Local 2599 president Jerry Green put it: “He’s one of us.”<\/p>\nWhen I mention to Fetterman that he doesn’t look like a typical politician, he makes a tremendous effort not to roll his eyes. “I am a conventionally unattractive person. This is how I dress, and that’s all I have to say about it,” he says. “If I wear a suit, I get sh-t; if I wear shorts, I get sh-t.”<\/p>\nFetterman, 52, was born to teen parents and grew up in York, Pa. His father worked a union job at a grocery before becoming successful in the insurance industry; both of Fetterman’s parents are conservative Republicans. He was all set to follow his dad into insurance until a tragedy knocked him off course: in 1993, a friend was killed in a fatal car accident on the way to pick him up. Fetterman began volunteering with the Boys & Girls Club. He joined AmeriCorps in Pittsburgh, got a degree from the Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government, and started teaching GED classes in Braddock, a western Pennsylvania town that had been decimated by the loss of local steel jobs.<\/p>\nAfter two of his students were gunned down, Fetterman ran for mayor of Braddock in 2005. For the next 13 years, he worked to revitalize a town once known as the “murder capital” of the region, implementing youth anti-violence programs that helped it go five years without a homicide. The dates of every murder in Braddock that happened on his watch are tattooed on Fetterman’s right forearm.<\/p>\nRead More: <\/strong>"https:\/\/time.com\/6175300\/pennsylvania-senate-primary-abortion\/\" >Pennsylvania’s Senate Primary Shows How Republicans’ Abortion Rhetoric Could Backfire<\/em><\/a>.<\/p>\nOne"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2021\/02\/09\/us\/politics\/john-fetterman-gun-black-jogger.html\" target=\"_blank\">incident<\/a> from Braddock threatened to overshadow Fetterman’s campaign. In 2013, while outside with his young son, Fetterman thought he heard gunshots and saw a man running from the area. He chased him down in his truck and detained him with a shotgun until police came. The man turned out to be an unarmed Black jogger. Opponents have suggested it was a racist incident, and"https:\/\/triblive.com\/news\/pennsylvania\/kenyatta-criticizes-fetterman-over-black-jogger-incident-in-virtual-senate-forum\/\" target=\"_blank\">demand Fetterman apologize<\/a>. Fetterman says he never aimed his gun at the man, and points out that after the incident, the mostly Black voters of Braddock re-elected him to two more terms. He also points to his record on clemency. As the state’s lieutenant governor since 2019, Fetterman has revitalized the Pennsylvania Board of Pardons, eliminating application fees and presided over a seven-fold rise in recommended commutations of life sentences.<\/p>\nWhile Fetterman endorsed Bernie Sanders in the 2016 presidential primary, he now avoids most progressive litmus tests. His main issues are raising the minimum wage, legalizing marijuana, and nuking the filibuster to help Biden get things done. He’s not a purist on Medicare for All (he’s for “expanding health care access, whatever that looks like”) and he isn’t pushing the Green New Deal. He told the steelworkers he was “pro-policing, pro–community policing, pro–funding the police,” and called the activist cry to “defund the police” an “absurd phrase.” He once called fracking an “environmental abomination,” but now says the industry has reformed enough that he sees the practice as crucial to energy security.<\/p>\nFetterman isn’t running as a progressive crusader or policy wonk. He’s running to be the Democrats’ 51st vote in the Senate.

Power curbs will also hit India’s already faltering rebound in industrial production.<\/p>\nRead More:<\/strong>"https:\/\/time.com\/6171213\/climate-change-tv-film\/\" >Imagine If Hollywood Made Realistic Climate Stories<\/a><\/em><\/p>\nProduction of coal, the fossil fuel that accounts for more than 70% of India’s electricity generation, has failed to keep pace with unprecedented energy demand from the heat wave and the country’s post-pandemic industrial revival. Logistics snarls, including a lack of railway carriages to transport the fuel from mines to power plants, are exacerbating the shortages.<\/p>\n“If power supply is curtailed to the industrial sector, it could delay the recovery in the manufacturing sector by at least one more quarter,” said Aditi Nayar, an economist with ICRA Ltd.<\/p>\nStockpiles at coal-fired power stations have tumbled more than 14% since the start of April, leaving about 100 plants with critical supply levels, according to the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. Reserves are forecast to shrink further on high demand, and that’ll be followed by a monsoon season from July.<\/p>\n"inline-portrait_small_2x aligncenter \">"lazy\"

shipments.<\/p>\n“If coal stockpiles continue to deplete at this rate, we’re going to see a full-blown power crisis across the country,” said Shailendra Dubey, chairman at the All India Power Engineers Federation, an advocacy body that produces energy policy suggestions.<\/p>\nElectricity demand hit a record 207.1 gigawatts on Friday and is expected to rise to 220 gigawatts within the next two months, according to India’s power ministry. Average spot power prices at Indian Energy Exchange have jumped to about 10 rupees (13 cents) a kilowatt hour, almost triple the average in January, and have been"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">capped<\/a> by the industry regulator.<\/p>\nAt least 16 of India’s 28 states have been grappling with power outages of between two and 10 hours a day, Ashok Gehlot, chief minister of Rajasthan, said Monday in a Twitter"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ashokgehlot51\/status\/1520962835928739840\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">message<\/a>, before conditions eased in some areas.<\/p>\nRead More:<\/strong>"https:\/\/time.com\/6106343\/india-china-coal-shortages\/\" >Why Coal Shortages in Asia Might Be Good News for Clean Energy<\/a><\/em><\/p>\nThe western desert state, a hub for metal smelters to textile factories, last week ordered power supplies to some industries cut by as much as half. Citizens should limit their use of appliances like air conditioners and coolers in homes and workplaces, Gehlot said.<\/p>\nMaharashtra, home to the nation’s financial capital Mumbai, is battling worsening blackouts, said S. Maheshkumar, general secretary at Maharashtra Industrial and Economic Development Association. “Industries are worried that they may have to cut production and turn down export and domestic orders,” he said by phone.<\/p>\n"inline-portrait_small_2x aligncenter \">"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/api.time.com\/wp-content\/plugins\/lazy-load-0.7\/images\/1x1.trans.gif\" alt=\"Residents Experience The Heat

grappling with power outages of between two and 10 hours a day<\/span>Anger over patchy electricity supplies prompted protests across the northern state of Punjab — India’s top grains producer — over the weekend, with farmers blockading roads as they appeal for a minimum of eight hours of power a day for agricultural use. Already there are concerns about electricity supply during a paddy sowing season from mid-June, Kamaljeet Singh Hayer, a farmer in the state’s Ferozepur district, said by phone.<\/p>\n\nIn the coal mining states of Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh, many industries are cutting output or running back-up generators with expensive diesel. “If we have to operate like this, we’ll all soon be in the red,” said Philip Mathew, president of Jharkhand Small Industries Association.<\/p>\nOpposition party members marched Saturday through streets in Jammu, protesting against six-hour daily outages. Blackouts have struck key population centers including Uttar Pradesh, and even where supplies are slowly improving like in Karnataka and Kerala connections still aren’t guaranteed around-the-clock.<\/p>\nWhile Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government isn’t yet facing major new dissent, India’s economy is under pressure from high energy prices, rising inflation and the impacts of the Covid pandemic, including low employment, said Shumita Deveshwar, senior director of India research at TS Lombard.<\/p>\n“These have the potential to become bigger political issues in the longer-term,” Deveshwar said. “If the coal crisis continues for an extended period, it will add to the pressure.”<\/p>\n"news-rsf-assists\">—With assistance from Ruchi Bhatia, Bibhudatta Pradhan and Josh Saul<\/em><\/p>\n","read_more":true,"section":{"name":"World","slug":"world","url":"https:\/\/time.com\/world\/","description":"The latest news and analysis from TIME's correspondents on world politics, diplomacy, conflict, culture, humanitarian disasters, religion and much more","world":true,"all_sections":["time-section-climate","time-section-world"]},"tag":{"name":"India","slug":"india","url":"https:\/\/time.com\/tag\/india\/"},"tags":"climate change|healthscienceclimate|India|overnight|wire","hero":{"class":"landscape","thumbnail":"https:\/\/api.time.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/GettyImages-1240394446.jpg?quality=85&w=100&h=100&crop=1","src":{"small":"https:\/\/api.time.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/GettyImages-1240394446.jpg?quality=85&w=280","small_2x":"https:\/\/api.time.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/GettyImages-1240394446.jpg?quality=85&w=560","landscape_large":"https:\/\/api.time.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/GettyImages-1240394446.jpg?quality=85&w=550&h=367&crop=1","large":"https:\/\/api.time.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/GettyImages-1240394446.jpg?quality=85&w=550","large_2x":"https:\/\/api.time.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/GettyImages-1240394446.jpg?quality=85&w=1024","square":"https:\/\/api.time.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/GettyImages-1240394446.jpg?quality=85&w=600&h=600&crop=1"},"credit":"Sajjad Hussain\u2014AFP\/Getty Images","caption":"People walk across a parched riverbed on a hot summer day in New Delhi, May 2, 2022.

It’s rotted through. Its remains have collapsed and buried the world order beneath. Trying to revive it is futile.<\/p>\nMost of all it resembles a broken automaton: its limbs are still able to move, but its gears are worn out, its springs are stretched. And the synchronicity that used to give perfection to its movements, has long gone.<\/p>\nClockwork toys, robots’ mechanical ancestors, became fashionable with the European royal courts during the Thirty Years’ War in the 17th century. But the first world conflict in European history, a series of interconnected wars, resulted in something even more important: creation of the first world order ever.<\/p>\nSince then, the system of international relations has been based on the Peace of Westphalia 1648 and its core principles: national sovereignty, foreign and domestic policies separation, compromise as a means of reconciling conflicting national interests, equality of sovereign states, and negotiating relations between them.<\/p>\nAll the subsequent systems were in fact more or less successful attempts to amend this order to ensure the balance of interests of leading states (known as the Great Powers).<\/p>\nThis tendency was clearly traced from the Congress of Vienna in 1815 to the Potsdam Conference in 1945. Between the dates, attempts to reject any of the principles of the Peace of Westphalia would inevitably lead to new conflicts. The Great Powers’ aspirations to impose their own will on the rest of the world by force brought the nightmare of two world wars. Or, as some historians rightly point out, the Second Thirty Years’ War of 1914-1945.<\/p>\nNow history repeats itself. Russia’s war on Ukraine is a rejection of all Westphalian principles. We are denied the right to sovereignty. We are under pressure to change our domestic policy. Under the guise of compromise, we are offered surrender. We are denied subjectivity and therefore equality. Our civilians are being tortured and killed en masse for simply being Ukrainian citizens.<\/p>\nIt is a crusade against Ukraine in the literal historical sense—it’s a sheer aggression, accompanied by sadism, raping, marauding, looting and systematic malicious destruction, under the guise of serving a greater purpose. The purpose that Russian propaganda, statesmen, and religious leaders define as a fundamentally false narrative of “protecting the spiritual ‘Third Rome’ from the spiritless and treacherous West breaches.” And the Patriarch of Moscow"https:\/\/time.com\/6167332\/putin-russian-orthodox-church-war-ukraine\/\" >blesses<\/a> with his own hand Russian soldiers to conquer

4<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\nThe aggression against Ukraine is a natural consequence of the continuous series of conflicts in which Russia took part after the collapse of the USSR. This is the decisive phase of the Third Thirty Years’ War. No one can predict how long it will last.<\/p>\nThere is one thing we can be sure: Moscow has consciously chosen the path of international relations archaization. It has chosen to consistently deny the primacy of international over national law, systematic violations of agreements, and withdrawal from any rules contradicting its aggressive ambitions. It is has chose to disrupt the international bodies—these are all signs of the drive to replace the rule of law with the right of force. We should clearly understand that the Russian regime is not the only one in this endeavor.<\/p>\nRussia is at the forefront of the forces intent on rolling back the international relations system. How far will they go? That is the key issue.<\/p>\nPrior 2014, an opinion was popular among some experts that Russia was counting on a second “Yalta” – in the sense of the world redistribution by blocs. However, Russia is currently unable to create influential international bodies, and all such efforts under Moscow’s auspices are purely instrumental. However, the Kremlin is also reluctant to become a junior partner in international bodies.<\/p>\nRead More:"https:\/\/time.com\/6171277\/volodymyr-zelensky-interview-ukraine-war\/\" >Inside Zelensky’s World<\/a> <\/strong><\/em><\/p>\nSo where does it go? Its goals move even further into the past to the pre-bloc era of the Vienna Congress. The European concert as a prototype of the world concert, playing the music chosen by the Great Powers—the concept is very tempting for Russia. After all, its leadership is still guided by the principles of the Holy Alliance (the League of the Three Emperors), and is using ‘legitimacy’ to deny the right of nations to self-determination and independent foreign policy. Just like the Romanovs did.<\/p>\nThe current Russian regime is not a restorer. It does not need to recreate either the Romanov Empire or the USSR. It is not restoring the empire, but creating a fantasy based on the true story, the way Hollywood does. It is an attempt to replay history turning moments and cancel or offset unsatisfactory results, including the Caribbean crisis, the dismantling of the Soviet bloc, and subsequent NATO enlargement.<\/p>\nThe Kremlin has been successfully doing this for a long time. It has accomplices. We know their names.<\/p>\nSome, like the"https:\/\/time.com\/6164091\/hungary-elections-results-2022\/\" >Hungarian<\/a> authorities, are still willing to do business with Russia on Kremlin terms. We know how European elites have consistently undermined European values in exchange for Russian money and energy. We remember how Angela Merkel and Nicolas Sarkozy neglected the interests of the whole of Europe to strengthen the positions of Germany and France. Back in 2008, they transformed the NATO Bucharest Summit into a Congress of Vienna look-alike.<\/p>\nThe refusal to let Ukraine and Georgia into NATO was a de facto consent to Russia’s aggression against both countries. The era of hybridity in modern international relations started. Since then, Russia has resorted to realpolitik to cover up the purely ideological motivation of its actions. And the West, meanwhile, has been using ideology as a facade for realpolitik. The fact is that the values-interests conflict deepens the crisis. That’s what is happening now.<\/p>\nInternational organizations have shown a complete inability to stop the aggressor. The E.U. consensus decisions aimed at deterring and punishing Russia are systematically weakened by national governments. The U.N. is unable to work effectively. The Security Council is in need of reform—a country resorting to annexation, aggressive wars, and genocide should definitely not be its permanent member.<\/p>\nNATO still allows Russia to intervene in the enlargement issue, both directly and through cautious and amnesiac politicians. As current events show, NATO continues to pursue a policy of double standards. Its readiness to accept"https:\/\/time.com\/6169708\/finland-sweden-nato-expansion\/\" >Finland and Sweden<\/a> against the uncertain signals and constant delays on Ukraine’s bid.<\/p>\nThe two states’ drive to join the Alliance is a direct consequence of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which remained de facto neutral precisely because of NATO’s refusal to provide it with a clear path to membership. The results are clear. Russian missiles are destroying Ukrainian cities. Russian soldiers by thousands are"https:\/\/time.com\/6168330\/rape-war-crime-russia-ukraine\/\" >raping<\/a> and killing Ukrainian citizens, even children. And some of the allies are still trying to avoid confrontation despite the Russian leadership threatening them.<\/p>\nAgainst the background of the helpless Budapest Memorandum, the signal is obvious: if invaded, the states having no weapons of mass destruction and having failed to get under the collective security umbrella can count on unlimited concern. Humanitarian aid and allowing refugees are likely, too. But the perspective of punishing the aggressor gets uncertain for those countries. This was the case in 2014, when Russia occupied the Ukrainian Crimea and Donbas. Many in Europe would like to retain the status quo even now.<\/p>\nNATO still has a chance to show responsibility and independence. Instead of talking about “the doors open for everyone,” it’s the right time to open them for Ukraine. Right now the Russian leadership is confident it’s got the right to destroy Ukraine.<\/p>\nBut the Ukrainian people’s fierce resistance spoiled the game. Our longing for freedom has proven to be stronger. Only after the tragedies of Mariupol,"https:\/\/time.com\/6166681\/bucha-massacre-ukraine-dispatch\/\" >Bucha<\/a>, Gostomel, Chernihiv, Kharkiv and dozens of other places did the international community start to understand what we are dealing with. Each passing day brings horrible footage of the inhumane crimes of the Russian Army. But these tragedies could have been avoided if there were leaders who could defend the world order.<\/p>\nOtto von Bismarck said: “We live in a wondrous time, in which the strong is weak because of his scruples and the weak grows strong because of his audacity.” It’s now again. The time of leaders who act decisively, making the dreams possible and realizing possibilities. Such people have been in business for a long time—those active visionaries like Steve Jobs and"https:\/\/time.com\/person-of-the-year-2021-elon-musk\/\" >Elon Musk<\/a>, bringing the future to humankind. Until recently, such people were very scarce in politics, because leadership is a burden of responsibility you take on voluntarily while everyone else shuns it.<\/p>\nRead More:"https:\/\/time.com\/6164810\/ukraine-is-our-past-and-our-future\/\" >Ukraine Is Our Past and Our Future<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n"https:\/\/time.com\/6171277\/volodymyr-zelensky-interview-ukraine-war\/\" >Volodymyr Zelensky<\/a> had to bear this burden. The Ukrainian President brought seemingly forgotten virtues into world politics. In the greatest ordeal of war, he became the conductor of the Ukrainian philosophy of freedom in the whole world. So, today Ukraine is not just a country near Russia. Not a weak and corrupt state, whose leaders used to buy handshakes and minute meetings on the sidelines. Volodymyr Zelenskyy is different. He is sincere. He is brave. He is popular. It’s a politician of a new formation. And Ukraine is a state of a new formation. Ukrainians are a model of courage for the whole democratic world.<\/p>\nThe time of our loneliness is over. The article size prevents me from listing all those who came to our aid, but be sure: Ukraine is very grateful to all of you.<\/p>\nBut there have been too many martyr heroes in our history. Each generation of Ukrainians had its own 300 Spartans and its own Thermopylae. So now is the time for the winning heroes. Heroes who will live long and happily in their free state. We have proved we are worth it. As did Israel back in 1948. And, like Israel, we need, with all means available, to obtain weapons to defeat the outnumbering enemy. Without the support of the U.S., U.K., Poland, the Baltic States, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and many others, it would be much harder for us to hold on. Yet, at first, we had to struggle to get the support. The same way as Israel. Apparently, over the years, the world’s democracies have forgotten that someone can be eager to destroy states and nations.<\/p>\nMariupol, Bucha, Irpin, and dozens other places have proved it that they can. So, Ukraine needs reliable, comprehensive, and binding security guarantees. The world needs such guarantees. Without them, any agreement with Russia will only be a truce, temporary, and fragile.<\/p>\nBut to make Russia sign it, we need to hold.<\/p>\n“Give us the tools, and we will finish the job,” said Winston Churchill, urging the United States to launch the lend-lease. It responded then, and the Allies defeated Nazism. Today, we repeat the same call—and we see that we are heard. Lend-lease will help Ukraine survive. Restore the state’s integrity. Bring back our people. Punish the aggressor decisively and severely. This will be our victory. But there is an issue that needs to be addressed now.<\/p>\nWe need to understand how the world will live afterwards. We need to make sure that the ambition to conquer gets too costly and painful to pursue.<\/p>\nObviously, the key provisions of the Peace of Westphalia cannot be questioned. Therefore, we need a conceptual return to it with the heavy baggage of experience we have and with the understanding that talking rationality with fanatics is senseless.<\/p>\nSeveral years ago, Richard Haass put forward the concept of"https:\/\/www.project-syndicate.org\/commentary\/rethinking-sovereignty\" target=\"_blank\">responsible sovereignty<\/a>, providing a quantitative rather than absolute model of state sovereignty depending on the regime’s behavior. That is, the sovereignty may be limited if the regime poses a threat to others.<\/p>\nHowever, a fundamental question arises here: how to avoid the transformation of the world order into equilibrium, the constant balancing of the interests of the same old Great Powers, which due to their force will remain untouchable? Obviously, such a scenario is wrong, and the Russian case has proved it clearly.<\/p>\nHenry Kissinger explained why: “Any system of world order, to be sustainable, must be accepted as just—not only by leaders, but also by citizens. It must reflect two truths: order without freedom, even if sustained by momentary exaltation, eventually creates its own counterpoise; yet freedom cannot be secured or sustained without a framework of order to keep the peace. Order and freedom, sometimes described as opposite poles on the spectrum of experience, should instead be understood as interdependent”.<\/p>\nFollowing Mr. Kissinger, I’d like to ask: Can today’s leaders rise above the urgency of day-to-day events to achieve this balance?<\/p>\nRussia is losing strength. The atrocities the Russian soldiers commit are a sign of weakness, a sign of degradation, overstrain of the empire’s forces and its inevitable collapse. So now is the right time for such reforms. Now is the right time for a combination of interest and justice, values ​​and realpolitik. Time to reform international institutions. To create an effective security format in the event that NATO does not dare to show determination—the determination that created it back in 1949. The determination of the Alliance member states’ citizens to support our Euro-Atlantic aspirations and our just struggle.<\/p>\nWe propose a new collective agreement on security guarantees for Ukraine—as a basis for a collective response to global security challenges. It is obvious that neutrality cannot be the key issue in this agreement.<\/p>\nThis agreement should ensure the status of Ukraine as a democratic, sovereign and integral state—without putting the issues of Donbas and Crimea in brackets. The conditions for securing such a status are a matter for discussion, but it is clear that there is room for both the West and the East among the guarantors. For the Americas, Europe, Asia and Africa. For the U.N. Security Council members, Poland, Italy, Germany, Turkey, Canada, Israel… The club is open. Ukraine is one of the leading guarantors of world"https:\/\/time.com\/6162598\/ukraine-war-food-shortage\/\" >food security<\/a>, so securing it is not only a moral issue, but also a purely practical one.<\/p>\nMoreover, Ukraine is the shield protecting Europe from invasion, which Russian officials frankly speak of. You may not believe them, as we did not believe until 2014—but history clearly shows that empires have two states only: expansion and disintegration.<\/p>\nIn the future, the Ukrainian security platform should become the basis for the U-24, United for Peace multilateral format. A kind of rescue service responsible states would provide for the countries in need. The service, which, despite the U.N. paralysis and the unbeatable vetos will be able within 24 hours to provide aid—humanitarian, financial, material and military-technical—to a state that suffered aggression. A service that will punish the aggressor within 24 hours by imposing sanctions.<\/p>\nAfter all, crushing exports is more sobering than freezing the aggressor state officials’ assets.<\/p>\nUkraine has been paying a very high price for its leading position in this system. The Moscow-centric world’s inevitable collapse is a chance for new leadership. Democratic. Humane. Human-centered. The leadership of a state whose people value liberty above all.<\/p>\nUkrainians are as capable of creating as of fighting. We will definitely rebuild our beautiful country. Post-war recovery will give a powerful boost to our economy. Today it is the right thing to invest in Ukraine’s defense. Tomorrow it will be a profitable thing to invest in its development. You can bet on it.<\/p>\n","read_more":true,"section":{"name":"Ideas","slug":"ideas","url":"https:\/\/time.com\/ideas\/","description":"TIME Ideas hosts the world's leading voices, providing commentary on events in news, society, and culture.

Wade <\/em>is about to be overruled. The Court prides itself on its extreme secrecy and even revelations about internal deliberations after the release of opinions are relatively rare. It is unprecedented for someone at the Court to give the press a copy of a draft opinion.<\/p>\nOf course, it is possible that the result could change between now and when the Court hands down its decision. In fact, in 1992, initially five justices voted inPlanned Parenthood v. Casey <\/em>to overruleRoe v. Wade<\/em>, only for Justice Anthony Kennedy to change his mind and join a majority to reaffirm the right to abortion. But given the composition of the current Court it seems highly unlikely thatRoe <\/em>will survive. The oral arguments on December 1 left no doubt that there are five conservative justices ready to overrule the 49 year-old precedent: Justices Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, and Barrett.<\/p>\nNow, we need to begin contemplating a world without a constitutional right to abortion and thus a return to the time beforeRoe <\/em>when abortion was illegal in most states. The effect of overrulingRoe<\/em>, as"https:\/\/www.politico.com\/news\/2022\/05\/02\/read-justice-alito-initial-abortion-opinion-overturn-roe-v-wade-pdf-00029504\" target=\"_blank\">Justice Alito’s draft opinion<\/a> says, is to leave the issue of abortion to the political process. For now, it will mean that each state can decide whether to allow abortions or whether to prohibit some or all abortions. It is expected that over"https:\/\/www.vox.com\/23013308\/supreme-court-roe-wade-abortion-legal-oklahoma-dobbs-jackson-womens-health\" target=\"_blank\">half the states<\/a> will prohibit all or virtually all abortions.<\/p>\nRead More: <\/b>"https:\/\/time.com\/6173019\/supreme-court-leak-roe-v-wade-abortion\/\" >"font-weight: 400;\">What to Know About the Leaked Roe v. Wade Supreme Court Draft Opinion<\/span><\/i><\/a><\/p>\nWomen in these states who want abortions and have money will travel to places where abortion is legal. But poor women and teenagers again will face the cruel choice between an unsafe abortion or an unwanted child.<\/p>\nThe implications for the law of overrulingRoe <\/em>will be enormous. Justice Alito’s draft opinion for the Court says thatRoe <\/em>was “egregiously wrong” because it protects a right that was not included in the text of the Constitution, was not protected by the original meaning of the Constitution, and was not traditionally safeguarded as a constitutional right.<\/p>\nBut by that reasoning, countless other Supreme Court decisions protecting basic aspects of privacy and autonomy were wrongly decided as well. For example, it was not until 1965, inGriswold v. Connecticut<\/em>, that the Court held that the Constitution protects a right to purchase and use contraceptives. It, too, is not a right in the text of the Constitution or contemplated when the document was ratified or that was historically protected. I expect that afterRoe <\/em>is overruled some states will quickly pass laws prohibiting types of contraceptives that act after conception, like the IUD and the morning-after-pill. Under Justice Alito’s reasoning, those laws too would be constitutional.<\/p>\nRead More:<\/b>"https:\/\/time.com\/6165848\/abortion-pills-republican-states-roe-wade\/\" >"font-weight: 400;\">Republican States Crack Down on Access to Abortion Pills as Supreme Court Decision Looms<\/span><\/i><\/a><\/p>\nOr consider the right to marry. It wasn’t until 1967, inLoving v. Virginia<\/em>, and 2015, inObergefell v. Hodges<\/em>, that the Court protected a constitutional right to marry striking down laws prohibiting interracial marriage in the former case and laws forbidding same-sex marriage in the latter. But this right cannot be found in the text, the original meaning, or tradition.<\/p>\nLikewise, the Court has protected the right to procreate, the right to custody of one’s children, the right to keep the family together, the right of parents to control the upbringing of their children, the right of competent adults to refuse medical care, and the right of consenting adults to engage in same-sex sexual activity under the liberty of the due process clause. These rights, too, cannot be justified under the Court’s approach in Justice Alito’s draft opinion.<\/p>\nSimply put, the Court’s pulling out the thread of abortion rights threatens to unravel a fabric of rights that has been protected for decades. These are fundamental aspects of liberty that warrant constitutional protection.<\/p>\nThe Court’s overrulingRoe <\/em>is not going to end the debate or the intense political controversy over abortion. Quite the contrary, it will intensify it as it will become the dominant issue in countless elections for Congress, for state legislatures, for city councils, and for judgeships.<\/p>\nThroughout American history, the Court has celebrated the importance of following precedent because it provides predictability and stability in the law. From Justice Alito’s opinion it is clear that five justices are about to overruleRoe <\/em>because they disagree with it. The implications for the future of constitutional law, and for the Court’s legitimacy, are potentially enormous.<\/p>\n","read_more":true,"section":{"name":"Ideas","slug":"ideas","url":"https:\/\/time.com\/ideas\/","description":"TIME Ideas hosts the world's leading voices, providing commentary on events in news, society, and culture.

The day after the draft appeared, NARAL saw a 1,403% increase in donations. Planned Parenthood reported a 650% uptick in donations and engagement. Democratic fundraising platform ActBlue raised $12 million in the 24 hours after draft was made public, and the Abortion Care Network, which supports independent abortion clinics nationwide, raised $250,000 in the first three days after the leak from more than 12,000 donors, about 95% of whom were new. Abortion providers also reported a flood of patients seeking birth control appointments, hoping to stockpile emergency contraception, or asking to proactively order abortion pills. Just 16 states and Washington, D.C., have laws on their books that explicitly protect abortion rights, shouldRoe<\/i> cease to be the law of the land.<\/p>\n"p2\">For conservatives, the draft decision was cause for celebration. “If this is the opinion of the Court, it will be one of the greatest opinions in Supreme Court history. It will save millions of lives,” Republican Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri tweeted on May 3. The draft was seen as validation of both conservatives’ strategy and their core belief: thatRoe<\/i> was wrongly decided and that the only way to redress that error was to deliver conservatives onto the highest court. On social media, religious leaders thanked former President Donald Trump, whose three Supreme Court appointments brought this moment to fruition. If the court’s final opinion is similar to the leaked draft,"https:\/\/time.com\/6173196\/abortion-trigger-laws-bans-roe-v-wade\/\" >13 states with “trigger laws”<\/a> will ban abortion almost immediately; at least 10 more are likely to implement abortion bans or restrictions soon after.<\/p>\nRead More:<\/strong>"https:\/\/time.com\/6174148\/republican-states-abortion-bans-roe-v-wade\/\" >After Supreme Court Leak, Republican-led States Ready Legislation to Ban or Criminalize Abortion<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n"p2\">In the days after the draft’s publication, many national Republicans focused on condemning the leak rather than addressing the substance of the draft, as political strategists debated the political risk of opposing a procedure that the majority of Americans support in some form. A leaked memo from the National Republican Senatorial Committee advised candidates that “our position should be based in compassion and reason,” and emphasized, “Republicans DO NOT want to throw doctors and women in jail.” But at the same time, some GOP members of Congress also floated passing a national abortion ban.<\/p>\n"p2\">The real action was in the states, where"https:\/\/time.com\/6174148\/republican-states-abortion-bans-roe-v-wade\/\" >Republican legislators rushed to ready abortion bans<\/a>, advance criminal penalties for performing abortions, and consider defining life as starting at conception, a move that carries major implications for everything from miscarriages to contraception like intrauterine devices (IUDs) to the so-called morning-after pill. “No compromises, no more waiting,” said Brian Gunter, a pastor who helped write a Louisiana bill classifying abortion as homicide. In Georgia, state representative Ed Setzler, who sponsored a 2019 abortion ban, cheered his colleagues’ ambitions. “I think perhaps we’re coming to a place where we recognize that the deep brutality ofRoe v. Wade,<\/i>” he told TIME, “may be coming to an end.”<\/p>\n"inline-portrait_small_2x alignnone \">"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/api.time.com\/wp-content\/plugins\/lazy-load-0.7\/images\/1x1.trans.gif\" alt=\"Members and supporters of Abortion Access Front tape cutouts of Supreme Court justices to poles before a protest at Foley Square in Manhattan, May 3, 2022.

Abortion-rights advocates rushed to assure patients, while simultaneously pushing out information about what may come next. If the Supreme Court does indeed overturnRoe,<\/i> many expect that"https:\/\/time.com\/6165848\/abortion-pills-republican-states-roe-wade\/\" >abortion pills<\/a>, which can be"https:\/\/time.com\/5954429\/fda-biden-abortion-pills\/\" >prescribed via telehealth and sent in the mail<\/a>, will become the next arena of legal and legislative warfare. Others point to the likelihood that the nation will be split in half, with Democrat-led states seeing an influx of out-of-state patients seeking abortions within their borders. Several Democratic state legislatures have moved to protect providers and out-of-state patients, and to allocate money to help pay for their care. Katie Quinonez, executive director of West Virginia’s only abortion clinic, says that if her state makes the procedure illegal, she and her staff will help more patients travel to Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia.<\/p>\nRead More:<\/strong>"https:\/\/time.com\/6165848\/abortion-pills-republican-states-roe-wade\/\" >Republican States Crack Down on Access to Abortion Pills as Supreme Court Decision Looms<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n"p2\">In the age of the internet, we are unlikely to return to the back-alley abortions of the pre-Roe<\/i> era, but that, Quinonez says, is not the same as having access to legal care. Many would-be patients in places where abortion is illegal will likely struggle to take time off work, find transportation, or arrange childcare to get an abortion. Studies show that people who are denied abortions have worse mental health, more physical health issues including pregnancy-related death, higher rates of poverty and debt, and less financial security. Most people who seek abortions already have at least one child. The U.S., which has the highest"https:\/\/time.com\/6099821\/texas-abortion-maternal-mortality\/\" >maternal mortality<\/a> rate of any wealthy nation, is also unique among its peer nations in failing to provide robust, state-funded childcare, paid family leave, or other parental support.<\/p>\n"p3\">While the country, awash in uncertainty, awaits the court’s final ruling, one thing is now clear. The U.S. is on the cusp of a monumental shift in which issues surrounding women’s autonomy, privacy, and the government’s role in its citizens’ health will become central to our lives and our politics. The Justices’ final decision will shape not only reproductive rights, but also the health care system, criminal justice, workforce participation, and what it means to create a family in America.<\/p>\n"p3\">—With reporting by<\/i> Nik Popli\/Washington<\/p>\n","read_more":true,"section":{"name":"Politics","slug":"politics","url":"https:\/\/time.com\/politics\/","description":"Political insight from the Beltway and beyond.

Wade<\/em> <\/a>doesn’t just mean the process of returning the legality of abortion back to the states. For Alabama, where West Alabama Women’s Center is one of three remaining abortion clinics, legal abortion will end the moment that the U.S. Supreme Court says the very words “Roe<\/em> is overturned.” While 13 states have a variety of “trigger bans” that will make abortion illegal within weeks or even days of the Court’s ruling, Alabama has an abortion ban that predatesRoe <\/i><\/em>– one that makes abortion a jailable offense for both provider and patient. Once the Court makes its decision official, any procedure or pill provided afterward is instantly a crime.<\/p>\nFrom every day here on out, we know that our practice must revolve around the reality that if decisions are on the Supreme Court’s calendar, we must be prepared for our work to shift from completely legal to something that can get everyone arrested in a matter of seconds. It could be as abrupt as the moment between one patient swallowing a pill and the next patient receiving her water cup. A patient in the waiting room may end up with a legal abortion just by virtue of her number in line, while the rest may unfortunately be sent home. Or in the most horrifying of possibilities, a person could learn that the right to a legal abortion has disappeared while she literally lies on the exam table waiting for her procedure to begin.<\/p>\nFor a person who is pregnant and does not want to be, every second can feel endless. And now we know that in one second the entire landscape may shift, and her right to a legal abortion could be ripped from her hands. She may have followed every rule and restriction forced on her by the Alabama legislature: her mandatory 48-hour wait, her ultrasound, her multiple visits. She may have scraped together her payment, found childcare, requested time off from work, and even traveled across state lines. All this effort would be wasted if she happened to schedule her abortion on the morning the Supreme Court announces that a zygote now has more rights than any pregnancy-capable person in the state of Alabama.<\/p>\nRead More:<\/strong>"https:\/\/time.com\/6163613\/abortion-clinic-escorts\/\" >‘Keep Listening to My Voice.’ What It’s Like to Be an Abortion Clinic Escort<\/a><\/em><\/p>\nOur clinic has been planning for this moment since December, and we will do all we can to keep abortion accessible until we legally cannot. We also won’t close our doors once that happens. When abortion is illegal, patients will manage their own care and will need a safe place to go for follow-ups without fear of being turned into the police. There will be people miscarrying who will be unable to get medical help because doctors will be too scared of being accused of performing illegal abortions. We will fill the gaps that already exist in a state without Medicaid expansion, with the third highest maternal mortality, and that ranks 47th in child well-being – gaps that will only get worse as more people are forced into births they don’t want.<\/p>\nBodily autonomy is a human right that supersedes any Supreme Court decision, and we know that ending legal abortion will not end abortion itself. While it may take only one moment for abortion to become a crime, we vow to work as long as necessary because we believe that one day it will be legal again.<\/p>\n"video-container\">"MhBKvaNJ\" class=\"jw-video\" data-media-id=\"test\"><\/div><\/div>\n","read_more":true,"section":{"name":"Ideas","slug":"ideas","url":"https:\/\/time.com\/ideas\/","description":"TIME Ideas hosts the world's leading voices, providing commentary on events in news, society, and culture.

The market had already come to view fossil fuels as old, dirty energy, and after"https:\/\/time.com\/5824263\/coronavirus-negative-oil-prices-consolidation\/\" >oil prices cratered<\/a> in 2020, owing largely to the pandemic, investors wanted to know how these companies would adapt. They asked about whether carbon capture could be an engine to grow revenue and how the companies viewed the climate-policy landscape. “We are committed to providing products to help customers reduce their emissions,” said Darren Woods, the CEO of ExxonMobil. “Across the globe we’re helping economies decarbonize.”<\/p>\nThis year, the conversation was much different. Oil and gas are now"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2022\/05\/10\/investing\/oil-energy-stocks\/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">hot commodities<\/a> following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and on first-quarter investor calls in 2022, those same CEOs announced massive profits. As investors dialed in to pepper the CEOs with questions, the topic of climate change hardly came up. Instead, investors focused on dividends and share buybacks: ways the companies can pass along their profits to shareholders.<\/p>\nFor years, activists and politicians have condemned the industry for its efforts to deny the science of climate change and delay any action to address it. But"https:\/\/time.com\/collection-post\/6156525\/gas-prices-oil-prices-oil-and-gas-industry\/\" >what really moves the industry<\/a>—like any big industry—is financial performance. In the years leading up to the COVID-19 pandemic, energy was the worst-performing sector in the S&P 500 stock index—a reality that slowly but surely forced leaders to question their business model. Now, the financial rejuvenation of the oil and gas industry has created a complicated dynamic for those pushing the sector to align with the realities of climate change. Money talks, and right now there’s a lot of money to be made digging up and selling oil and gas. In a complete reversal from two years prior, energy is now the best performing sector of 2022 and the only industry on the S&P 500 stock index that has seen valuations rise this year.<\/p>\nThis renewed profitability has already raised alarms for many concerned about the science of climate change. In a 2021 report, the International Energy Agency laid out a pathway for the world to meet the targets set in the Paris Agreement, which calls for limiting global temperature rise to less than 2°C relative to pre-industrial levels. To do that, public- and private-sector- leaders need to pour trillions of dollars into clean energy, while also reducing financing for fossil fuels. Oil production needs to fall 75% by 2050; to get there, the world should already be ending investment in new fossil fuel production sites. “The scientists tell us that if we want to have a planet that is still livable, emissions need to come to net zero by 2050,” says"https:\/\/time.com\/collection\/100-most-influential-people-2021\/6095810\/fatih-birol\/\" >Fatih Birol<\/a>, the head of the IEA. “If these things happen, oil demand will go down.”<\/p>\nThese dual exigencies—an industry turning a healthy profit on its core products and the urgent need to decarbonize the global economy—have led activists around the world to ask a variation on the same question: How will the reign of oil and gas end? Another way to put it: In a free-market system where profit rules, how do you phase down a product that’s making a profit?<\/p>\n\/>\n"image-wrapper no-caption\">"alignnone size-portrait_small_2x

To protect their profits, they hid the evidence and launched public relations campaigns to sow doubt with the public and obstruct appropriate regulation. In"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=f4jYzVKxzPA&t=1s\" target=\"_blank\">Black Gold<\/em><\/a>, TIME’s new docuseries on the history of ExxonMobil’s denial of the science of climate change, viewers witness the oil and gas industry’s decades-long effort unfold as the planet warms. Scientists are silenced and shadowy dark-money groups are brought on to help shape the public conversation. The bottom line was profit. “It’s hard to imagine putting the fate of humanity at such risk in return for more money,” former Vice President Al Gore, who won the Nobel Peace Prize for his climate activism, says in the series.<\/p>\nThe efforts"https:\/\/time.com\/4874888\/climate-change-politics-history\/\" >paid dividends<\/a>. Presidential administrations committed to enacting climate policy, namely those of Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, struggled to get efforts off the ground as industry lobbying dissuaded would-be supporters. Under Republican administrations, the industry enjoyed unparalleled access, with former executives serving in key positions of authority and making government policy. Even President Biden, who campaigned on a promise to be the most climate-forward President yet, took office with climate plans largely centered on incentivizing clean energy rather than penalizing fossil fuels.<\/p>\nDenying climate-change science and delaying action are often portrayed by activists as a moral crime. “From a human perspective, it is the gravest sin I can imagine,” says Christine Arena, a former PR executive at Edelman who quit in protest of the company’s work with oil and gas trade groups, inBlack Gold.<\/em> Unsurprisingly, industry leaders don’t view it that way. In a"https:\/\/time.com\/5766188\/shell-oil-companies-fossil-fuels-climate-change\/\" >2019 interview<\/a>, I asked Shell CEO Ben van Beurden about a campaign accusing his company of knowing about climate change for decades and failing to act. Van Beurden acknowledged that “yeah, we knew” and added, “everybody knew.” He went on to argue that Shell had since publicly acknowledged the science of climate change, but society had failed to act. In other words, the blame shouldn’t fall on Shell; in a free-market economy, the role of a corporation is to make a profit, and, in that context, the company was delivering just as it was supposed to do.<\/p>\n"video-container\">"9PYkjXKy\" class=\"jw-video\" data-media-id=\"test\"><\/div><\/div>\n<\/div>\nIndeed, when the price of oil declined and profits waned in the mid-2010s—thanks to widespread deployment of"https:\/\/time.com\/5187074\/fracking-energy-oil-natural-gas\/\" >fracking<\/a> and horizontal drilling—the industry all of a sudden became vulnerable to pushes for change. Protesters staged die-ins at oil company headquarters. Climate activists used reports about the industry’s decades of climate denial to make a moral case. Meanwhile, college students pushed their universities to divest from fossil fuels, winning some victories while pushing public perception to grow more antagonistic toward oil and gas.<\/p>\nThese efforts made it harder to recruit talent into the industry and left companies increasingly vulnerable to regulation. Still, nothing challenged the industry’s attitude toward climate as much as the change in tone from investors. By 2020, according to the Forum for Sustainable and Responsible Investment, some $17 trillion dollars in investment had flowed into so-called ESG -investments—short for environmental, social and governance—and executives felt the pressure to offer a positive narrative about how their companies were approaching climate. “In the world of money, everyone lives on bended knee,” Brian Thomas, a managing director at Prudential Private Capital, said at an"https:\/\/time.com\/6156525\/gas-prices-oil-prices-oil-and-gas-industry\/\" >industry conference<\/a> in March. “The industry is beginning to kind of morph its behavior to reflect the concerns of its investor base, right or wrong.”<\/p>\nRegardless of climate concerns, investors across the board fretted about the dismal financial performance of oil and gas—the industry was failing to make money and needed to be disrupted. “The basic model is in pieces, it’s fallen apart,” Tom Sanzillo, director of finance at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, told me at the time. “This is an industry in last place.”<\/p>\nFossil-fuel companies embarked on efforts to change; the approach varied by company and region, but by and large they were piecemeal and insufficient. In an October 2021 hearing, members of the House Oversight Committee asked executives from some of the world’s largest oil and gas firms about their plans to address climate change. ExxonMobil CEO Woods cited the company’s investment in natural gas as an emissions-reducing tool. The CEO of Chevron said his company would try to emit less carbon in its operations.<\/p>\nIn short, the scale of the industry’s changes doesn’t match the science. Mike Sommers, the head of the American Petroleum Institute summed it up in a January 2022 address. While offering an unequivocal declaration that his industry needs to address climate change, he made clear that the industry would not shrink voluntarily. “We reject efforts to scale back domestic production,” he said. “This is about addition, not subtraction.”<\/p>\n"inline-portrait_small_2x alignnone \">"lazy\"

Following the initial attacks, proponents of clean energy suggested that the moment created a unique chance for policymakers to nudge the economy off fossil fuels. After all, oil and gas paid for Vladimir Putin’s war efforts and left people around the world vulnerable to the economic consequences of higher fuel prices. The European Commission, the E.U.’s executive body, quickly produced a plan to"https:\/\/time.com\/6142982\/russia-ukraine-natural-gas-energy\/\" >wean the bloc<\/a> off Russian gas with a dramatic proposal to ramp up the development of clean energy infrastructure. But, on the other side of the Atlantic, the policy picture has been less promising. Republicans opposed to climate legislation have used the spike in oil prices to blame the Biden Administration’s climate initiatives for hurting consumers. And the Administration has softened its climate messaging, tempering it with calls for greater oil and gas production in the short term.<\/p>\nStill, even without government policy to serve as a nudge, the oil and gas industry could have used the moment to embrace a different course. As prices rose, companies found themselves flush with no-strings-attached cash that could have been used to finance a true pivot toward green initiatives. But so far, companies have mostly used the money to pay enormous dividends to shareholders and buy back stock, thereby inflating the stock price. ExxonMobil made $5.5 billion in the first quarter of 2022; it plans to spend $30 billion buying back stock by 2023. Chevron made more than $6 billion; it said it would buy back $10 billion by the end of the year. Shell made $9.1 billion; it plans to repurchase $8.5 billion in shares in the first half of the year alone.<\/p>\nThe dynamic has led advocates, activists, and politicians to rethink their messaging. As consumers pay more for energy, criticizing the industry for its climate failures may not have the same resonance as it once did. Recent polls have shown that while the majority of Americans remain concerned about climate change, the issue has fallen on the list of priorities.
"https:\/\/time.com\/6160256\/gas-prices-climate-cost\/\" >Gas prices<\/a>, on the other hand, seem destined for center stage as the U.S. approaches congressional midterm elections.<\/p>\nAnd so the advocates have turned their attention to the enormous profit companies are making. The companies, these advocates say, should cut the price of their product—or else face a"https:\/\/oilprice.com\/Energy\/Energy-General\/The-Call-For-Windfall-Taxes-On-Energy-Firms-Is-Growing.html\" target=\"_blank\">windfall profit tax<\/a> that would take that money and return it to American taxpayers. “We need an offensive narrative: we’re just saying ‘Blame Putin,’ and they’re saying ‘Blame Biden,’” says Ro Khanna, a Democratic representative from California who is chair of the House Oversight Subcommittee on the Environment. “That’s not enough. We need to be saying ‘Blame Big Oil.’”<\/p>\nOn the surface, the pivot to talking about the industry’s profit margin may seem like an unfortunate turn away from the urgent reality of pushing these companies to slow fossil-fuel production. But it cuts to the core of the challenge the oil and gas industry poses to addressing climate change. Profits drove the industry’s climate denial from the beginning; profits are driving investment decisions today. When oil is truly no longer a good investment, its reign will come to an end.

As a student at the prestigious Iowa Writers’ Workshop, the author began writing what would become the first piece in her debut collection. The book, coming May 17, includes 10 stories, all published between 2009 and 2017 in literary journals and sites. <\/span><\/p>\n"font-weight: 400;\">The stories vary in subject, from a love triangle in Montana, to a complicated relationship between a gymnast and a hurdler at the Olympics, to the titular story about a former child actor on an airplane who has recently broken away from a cult.

What was it like revisiting them?<\/b><\/h3>\n"font-weight: 400;\">It’s always helpful when time defamiliarizes you from your own work. The short story taught me how to be a writer—it was the most efficient way to get better. Looking back at them, I can see what I was experimenting with and the little breakthroughs in each one.<\/span><\/p>\nYou feature several characters that are either famous or adjacent to fame. What draws you to that experience?<\/b><\/h3>\n"font-weight: 400;\">Celebrity gossip is our substitution for when we lived in smaller communities—we knew more people in common and had gossip we could all take part in. Writing about Hollywood tropes or riffing on existing stories allows you to start with a pre-established familiarity for the reader. Fame is so fascinating: there’s so much glamour, there’s artifice, there’s underlying skeeviness. Sometimes there’s just a mundane aspect to it. I can’t resist it. <\/span><\/p>\nAre you a tabloid reader?<\/b><\/h3>\n"font-weight: 400;\">Less and less, because it’s so fragmented now. When I was a teenager, <\/span>"font-weight: 400;\">and later, <\/span>"font-weight: 400;\">everyone picked up <\/span>"font-weight: 400;\">People<\/span><\/i>"font-weight: 400;\"> magazine at the grocery store or the doctor’s office, and you knew who everyone was. Now I’m like, Who are these people? The online influencers and HGTV stars, I have no idea who they are. <\/span><\/p>\nWhat do you make of the success of <\/b>Great Circle<\/i><\/b>?<\/b><\/h3>\n"font-weight: 400;\">It was a nightmare to write. I wasn’t on contract for it, and it took years and years. The success has been gratifying. The book tapped into certain appetites, and the fact that it was published during COVID actually changed its significance. This is a book about someone who feels it is essential to have freedom of movement, and it came out right in this moment when that was what we didn’t have. There’s a fashion right now for books that are fragmented or autofictional. I like those books, but there’s always room for a more epic story.<\/span><\/p>\nThere’s been a surge of pandemic-related fiction. Do you gravitate toward that subgenre?<\/b><\/h3>\n"font-weight: 400;\">It’s going to be a huge quandary going forward. The book I’m starting right now, I’m trying to set very recently—so you inevitably bump up against the pandemic. There will be a lot of fiction that goes through this time period but isn’t about the pandemic in the way some of the earlier stuff was. We’re still living it, so I don’t have a huge hunger to think about it more than I already do.<\/span><\/p>\nYou sold the television rights for <\/b>Great Circle<\/i><\/b>last year. Would you ever write for TV? <\/b><\/h3>\n"font-weight: 400;\">A lot of novelists think, Oh, how hard can it be? But writing for television is a really different skill, and you give up so much of what’s in your toolbox in order to do it. Maybe someday. <\/span><\/p>\n","read_more":true,"section":{"name":"Entertainment","slug":"entertainment","url":"https:\/\/time.com\/entertainment\/","description":"From esoteric art to Housewives

"https:\/\/time.com\/6151377\/putin-ukraine-attack-dictator\/\" >Vladimir Putin<\/a> has decided Ukraine belongs to Russia, and there are no boundaries, treaties, or warnings that will prevent him from waging war to make it so.

The U.S., the only nation that can project military power into every region of the world, has become its most"https:\/\/time.com\/5929978\/the-u-s-capitol-riot-was-years-in-the-making-heres-why-america-is-so-divided\/\" >politically dysfunctional<\/a> major power. A third of Americans say Joe Biden is not a legitimately elected President. Europeans have lost faith too. In 2016, Britain voted its way out of the E.U., and anti­-establishment, xenophobic parties of the far right shifted the politics inside many European states.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"gmail_default\">In fact, the entire international system is increasingly in question. China has advanced from impoverished to powerhouse over four decades and increasingly rejects the right of Western-led institutions to make and enforce international rules. Strongmen have emerged in Russia, India, Turkey, and even E.U. members Hungary and Poland to challenge principles of freedom of the press, democratic checks and balances, and minority rights. Few in any country have faith the U.N. can do much more than help care for and feed the refugees fleeing conflicts no one can resolve.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"gmail_default\">There’s a lot to be said for the idea that crises create opportunities that mustn’t be wasted. It’s true that our world has faced a stream of shocks in recent years: the 2008 global financial crisis, the Arab Spring, the 2015–2016 tidal wave of migrants into Europe, Brexit, the rise of angry populists in Europe and America, and then the worst pandemic in 100 years. None of these events has created a new sense of unity and purpose.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"gmail_default\">Now Russia has invaded Ukraine. War is killing civilians by the thousands, more than 5 million refugees have headed west in more than two months of fighting, NATO and Russia have moved to high alert, and fuel and food prices around the world are surging.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"gmail_default\">It’s no one’s fault the system is ­failing. Order and disorder are cyclical forces. The U.N. and institutions like the World Bank and IMF were built atop the ashes of a war that ended 77 years ago. That’s why Germany and Japan, wealthy and dynamic free-­market democracies committed to multilateralism and the rule of law, had no seats at the table for Zelensky’s speech to the Security Council—and why Russia did.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"gmail_default\">The"https:\/\/time.com\/6171833\/ukraine-global-system-failed\/\" >international system is broken<\/a>. To fix it, the world needs a crisis. It was the crisis of World War II that created institutions and alliances that helped keep the peace and invest in global development for decades after. Putin’s war on Ukraine has created the biggest geopolitical emergency since the Cold War’s end. The Russian ­government has even threatened the use of nuclear weapons and warned of World War III.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"gmail_default\">Can this crisis bolster dying institutions and create new ones?<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n"inline-portrait_small_2x alignnone \">"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/api.time.com\/wp-content\/plugins\/lazy-load-0.7\/images\/1x1.trans.gif\"

Since the Soviet collapse three decades ago, NATO has faced tough questions about its purpose. During his presidency, Donald Trump sometimes talked down ­NATO’s value for U.S. national security, and some of his former aides say he wanted to remove the U.S. from the alliance. In 2019, France’s ­President ­Emmanuel Macron warned of the “brain death of NATO.” Now he says that Putin’s invasion has delivered an “electric shock” and “strategic clarification” for NATO. Rather than weakening the alliance with a show of force and resolve in Ukraine, Putin looks to have persuaded"https:\/\/time.com\/6176023\/finland-sweden-nato\/\" >Finland and Sweden<\/a> to join it.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"gmail_default\">The shift in Germany is another big part of this story. The economic engine of Europe, with a government that has long tried to manage relations with Russia by cultivating cooperation through trade, has sharply changed its strategic direction in recent weeks. Three days after the Russian invasion, Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced during a historic speech to Parliament that Germany would send weapons to Ukraine, impose genuinely tough sanctions on Russia, and more than double German defense spending. His government announced in April it would stop importing Russian oil by the end of this year.<\/div>\n"gmail_default\">The E.U. also has a renewed sense of mission. Scorned by Britain and chastised by populists within many member countries, the E.U. has been given new energy by the war. The governments of Hungary and Poland have openly rebelled against its rules in recent years, but Russia’s invasion has forced Hungary’s Viktor Orban to curb his pro-Putin enthusiasm and presents Poland a chance to play European hero by accepting nearly 3 million Ukrainian refugees.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"gmail_default\">If these developments weren’t striking enough, consider that Putin has even given America’s Democrats and Republicans a sense of political unity that was best illustrated in March by a 424-8 vote in the House of Representatives to suspend normal trade relations with Russia and its ally Belarus. Putin has achieved the nearly unimaginable in U.S. politics: he’s persuaded many Americans to hate him more than they hate Americans of the opposite party.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"gmail_default\">We must remain realistic; the U.S., Europe, and the institutions that strengthen their partnership will face major tests in coming months and years. The U.S. is headed for yet another bitter election season ahead of midterms in November, and Americans and Europeans know that noted NATO skeptic Donald Trump may well become the Republican nominee in 2024. In Europe, the fallout from a likely prolonged military stalemate in Ukraine might change the political temperature. And though China won’t jeopardize its economic future by entering a long-term struggle with top trade partners Europe and America just to help its ally Russia, the longer-­term challenges it will pose for Western values and interests is much ­bigger than anything Putin is likely to concoct. President Biden’s calls for unity among democracies will antagonize both China and Russia.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"gmail_default\">In short, the Ukraine crisis has boosted some Western institutions that can strengthen democracy, rule of law, and human rights at the expense of authoritarians, at least the one who works in the Kremlin, but it won’t resolve the larger crisis of confidence to solve common problems. For that, we need something bigger.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"gmail_default\">There are other crises already<\/strong> unfolding that will offer real opportunities to boost international cooperation—if we can learn from the mistakes of the recent past. U.S. leadership will remain limited by the bitter partisan infighting that makes the U.S. so dysfunctional, and mistrust will limit how the U.S. and China can work together.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"gmail_default\">But if they can form pragmatic partnerships in critical areas, there are others that can play vital roles in boosting global cooperation. The E.U., in particular, has shown that alliances of like-­minded countries can still offer big solutions to big problems in their common interest. There are also roles for the private sector, the international scientific community, and ordinary citizens in boosting cooperation.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"gmail_default\">Even as public-health professionals and political leaders continue to wrestle with emerging variants of the virus that causes COVID-19, we might not have as much time as we think before the next pandemic strikes. Scientists have discovered dozens of lethal new pathogens in the past half-­century that leaped from animals to humans, and the pace of new discoveries is rising because wild animals are more frequently coming into direct contact as people encroach on animal habitats. Unsanitary factory farming also creates greater risks of new viruses.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"gmail_default\">In fact, though SARS-CoV-2, particularly in its"https:\/\/time.com\/6146694\/covid-19-omicron-optimism\/\" >Omicron variant<\/a>, has proved highly infectious, it’s far from the deadliest virus we’ve faced just in the past 20 years. Given how much we don’t know about the mutation of corona­viruses, it would be foolish to assume the next strain can’t be both more transmissible and more deadly.<\/div>\n\n"inline-portrait_small_2x

in Germany as the country starts to cut its reliance on Russian coal<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"gmail_default\">This pandemic has created the biggest truly global crisis of our lives, and there were real breakthroughs in multinational cooperation. Scientists shared ideas and information. International cooperation on COVID-19 included the beginnings of coordination on research and a global supply chain to distribute the vaccine. Central bankers took complementary, if not coordinated, action to boost sagging economies. International lenders offered emergency help, and vaccines were developed at unprecedented speed via joint ventures. Without the COVAX project, for example, the problems of vaccine hoarding and inequality between rich and poor nations would have been even worse than they are. The willingness of some countries to export excess supplies of vaccines—as the U.S. did for neighbors Mexico and Canada, and the U.S., Japan, India, and Australia did for other ­countries—­created a blueprint for shared sacrifice at a time of serious political and economic stress for all these countries.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"gmail_default\">But political leaders almost everywhere too often blamed and shamed scapegoats instead of rising to meet the moment in the face of invisible enemies that don’t care about boundaries. The COVID-19 pandemic, by itself, wasn’t frightening enough to make us build a new system of global public-health cooperation. Few leaders recognized that COVID-19 was a global threat that could never be effectively addressed without a global solution. In that sense, the pandemic was too small a crisis to force the kind of collaboration we needed. When the next deadly virus emerges, will we be better prepared?<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"gmail_default\">Climate change is the crisis<\/strong> that should give us the most hope. It’s the emergency most likely to force world leaders to share more information, costs, and responsibilities, because it threatens disasters that can destroy the lives of hundreds of millions of people, with impacts felt in every region of the world. Here, as in other areas, mutual suspicion will limit U.S. leadership and U.S.-China cooperation, but there are other actors that can lead.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"gmail_default\">Europe has already made genuinely historic progress. The so-called European Green Deal has boosted Europe as a leader on climate by committing unprecedented amounts of money toward the net-zero carbon-­emissions goal. By making climate spending a central pillar of its most recent budgets and COVID-19 economic-­relief plans, the European Commission has boosted its own power to raise future funds for pandemic relief and climate change from reluctant member states. Only those that comply with E.U. standards on emissions and other climate-­relevant policies can expect to get generous support for COVID recovery. It’s also possible that Russia’s war in Ukraine—and the need it creates to relieve European ­reliance on Russia for oil and gas—will spur large-scale investment in green technologies.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"gmail_default\">But progress is hardly limited to Europe. In fact, on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 195 countries signed on to a document that accepts the climate crisis as man-made. There is now a crucial global consensus on how much and how quickly the planet is warming, on which parts of the world have been affected most, and on the scale and likelihood of long-range scenarios. The governments of the world’s biggest polluters, including the U.S. and China, have committed themselves to cutting carbon emissions to net zero. Some of the world’s biggest companies have offered public commitments of their own. In short, climate change has presented an immediate, potentially crippling global problem that has forced many governments, the private sector, and civil-­society organizations to work together. But there are big ­unanswered questions. A certain degree of warming has already become inevitable, and governments and private-­sector leaders need to accept and spend more on climate-­adaptation strategies.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"gmail_default\">They also need to prepare for the economic—and, therefore, geopolitical—disruptions to come. At the moment, European leaders are putting finishing touches on a plan to end dependence on Russian oil and natural gas, but this is simply an acceleration of a process that global warming has ­already begun. In coming years, as rising seas and violent storms command our attention, and as green energy technologies become more affordable, the governments of countries that remain dependent on fossil fuel exports will face collapse, and as decarbonization strategies advance, these countries will export less oil and more turmoil.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"gmail_default\">The shift toward cleaner energy will transform long-standing fossil-fuel-based trade partnerships like China and Russia, and the U.S. and Saudi Arabia. That trend will shift the balance of power across entire regions and stoke conflicts that must be contained. One of the most important questions is how to prepare for a world with the tens of millions of climate refugees that will be created by the havoc from rising sea levels and increasingly erratic weather patterns. The political, economic, and humanitarian stakes couldn’t be higher.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"gmail_default\">There’s another challenge<\/strong> that may also amount to a crisis. A wide range of disruptive new technologies are fundamentally changing our relationships with government and with one another. They’re changing the way we think and the way we live—often in ways we don’t understand.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"gmail_default\">Even in a time of pandemic, when millions of lives depend on scientists and doctors to develop new protections and treatments quickly, we don’t inject large numbers of people with a new drug until we’ve tested it. We need to know how it will affect people, whether it will protect them, how long the protection will last, and what side effects it might have. But when we ­develop new algorithms that determine which ideas, information, and images we’ll ingest, the way we’ll spend money, the products we’ll buy, and how we’ll interact with other people, we do no testing at all. We allow private companies to inject all this directly into the public bloodstream.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"gmail_default\">Think of the many other ways new technologies are transforming our lives. They’re already reinventing the skills needed to earn a living, for example. We know that many workplaces are being automated, and that robots are performing a lot more jobs once held by people. But a 2019 study from the Brookings Institution found that workers with graduate or professional degrees will be almost four times as exposed to AI displacement in coming years as workers with a high school diploma.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"gmail_default\">New technologies are also changing warfare. In the coming age of autonomous weapons, war will more often be waged with the use of buttons that push themselves—by calculating how and when to strike without human oversight. In addition, cyberweapons are far more likely to be used on a large scale than far more expensive and harder to use nuclear weapons. They have already been deployed with increasingly disruptive effects in recent years, and the emerging Cold War confrontation between Russia and the West will highlight their dangers.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"gmail_default\">The primary cause for optimism won’t come from American leadership, hampered by bitter partisan divisions, or from U.S.-China cooperation, particularly in areas of fundamental ideological differences over the rights of the individual.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"gmail_default\">Fortunately, Europe is already playing a crucial regulatory role in some of these areas. On questions of data use and privacy, E.U. leaders are using the size of the European market to set rules for the globe. The world’s largest tech companies have far more power to effectively govern the digital space than any government does. Facebook, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Apple have all accumulated power that makes them arbiters of global affairs.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"gmail_default\">Whether the crisis that must be addressed is a new Cold War, the next pandemic, the profound disruption of climate change, or the dehumanizing power of many new technologies, there are challenges ahead that threaten our survival—but which can also form the basis for practical cooperation on important issues.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"gmail_default\">Our decisionmakers and influencers don’t have to like one another, much less agree on a single set of political and economic values. They don’t need to solve every problem. But never has it been more obvious that political leaders, the private sector, and citizens of all countries had better cooperate toward goals we can’t achieve alone. History shows it’s both necessary and possible.<\/div>\n<\/p>\n"image-wrapper no-caption\">"lazy\" class=\"alignleft wp-image-6176384 size-inline_small\"
