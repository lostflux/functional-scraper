I'm a tall,nerdy, white man in my late twenties who obsesses over tube mics and Japanese-made Les Paul guitars; I've never started my own podcast or livestream, but I totally thought I knew the best podcasting gear. It turns out that in the years I've spent outfitting my home recording studio with outboard preamps, compressors, and expensive XLR-based microphones, companies have spent tons of research dollars making equipment cheaper and smaller, with pretty incredible results.
I started exploring this more affordable frontier of digital recording and streaming gear, and the takeaway is that it's easier than ever to produce fantastic-sounding and gorgeous content without emptying your wallet. If you've been thinking about starting a podcast or sharing your epicMariospeed runswith the world, here's what you'll need.

Before You StartWe recommend alotof gear below, but before you buy anything, think hard about what it is you want to record or livestream. Brainstorm podcast ideas! Block out stories! Think of ways to make your livestreams different from what's out there. Whether it's just a hobby or you're serious about making this a business, good content is always going to be more important than the gear.
You’ll Want a Good ComputerIt's increasingly possible to record podcasts or stream live audio onsmartphones, but it's quicker, easier, and generally more professional to create and stream content on a personal computer. It doesn't really matter whether you have a PC or Mac, and the vast majority of modern laptops and desktops are more than fast enough for the audio tasks required.
If you're only doing audio recording and processing, any one ofour favorite laptops(or reallyany modern computer) will do. (Ourlaptop buying guidecan also help in your search.) However, if you're planning to livestream video or games from a PC, you will want a powerful computer that allows you to both play the game and run your streaming software. If you plan to record or edit video, you'll also want a speedy computer for rendering.
Here areour favorite gaming PCs right now, all of which are up to the task. Or you can check outour MacBook guide, which breaks down what is right for you. Consider alsobuilding your own PC—it requires more work, but you'll save money.
Audio Gear for PodcastingHere's what you'll need to make sure your podcast or stream sounds the best, from microphones to good headphones.
Blue Snowball micMost mics built into headphones, phones, and laptops do the job for calls and Zoom meetings, but they're not pristine enough for podcast stories or streams. The easiest way to upgrade your sound quality is with a USB microphone. These plug straight into your computer and allow you to record audio in surprisingly high fidelity given their ease of setup.
There are many good ones but also a sea of weird, off-brand models for sale on retailers like Amazon. Steer clear of those. My favorites come from Blue and JLab Audio. Entry-level mics like theBlue Snowball ($60)andJLab Talk Go ($50)are good beginner options.
You can also approach real studio-quality sound if you spring for higher-end models like theBlue Yeti X ($133),Jlab Talk Pro ($125),Shure MV7 ($250), orPresonus Revelator ($130), which come with better capsules and onboard processing.
Focusrite Scarlett 2I2If you've got multiple people you're looking to record or stream at once, you'll want to buy an audio interface. These are external audio cards that plug into a computer via a USB or Thunderbolt port and allow you to use traditional non-USB microphones. They also typically have headphone jacks, so you can listen as you record.
Audio interfaces start at about $100 for one with a single channel (a single input for a microphone or instrument cable), or they can cost several thousand dollars for models with dozens of inputs and other advanced features. The good news is that you don't need a super-fancy one! My pick for most people is theFocusrite Scarlett 2I2 ($170). It has two mic inputs, comes in a cool red, and sounds good enough for nearly every application you'll find. Another great option is theUniversal Audio Volt ($299), which comes with onboard replicas of outboard gear from the iconic recording brand.
For a mic to connect to the interface, snag aShure SM58($99)orSM57 ($99). These legendary, nearly bulletproof mics sound great, and you can often find them cheaper used. If you want something fancier, check out theShure SM7B ($399), which you'll probably recognize from many of your favorite podcasts, YouTube shows, and streams. If you want something else, check out thelatest mics from 512 Audio. The brand is a spin-off of popular home recording company Warm Audio, and its latest XLR-based mics sound very good.
Zoom H4N ProAnother great option for recording multiple people or for outdoor locations is a field recorder. WIRED editor Michael Calore uses one to track his vocals for each week'sGadget Labpodcast, and they sound pretty darn great.
My choice is theZoom H4N Pro($250), which lets you easily adjust the gain of the mic (how loud it records) and its sensitivity to sounds that aren't directly in front of it. You can choose to record only what's in front of (or behind) the mic if you wish. If you want something a bit more compact, check out theTula Mic ($230), which comes in cool colors and features a neat flip-style stand built in.
Aokeo pop filterMany microphones come with built-in filters to help keep yourpsounds from popping the mic, but if yours doesn't have one, it might be worth buyinga cheap pop filter ($11)that can easily attach to a desk or mic stand. If you're a streamer, place the mic farther from your face or off to the side, pointed at your mouth—pop filters can sometimes block you from view.
If you have a Blue Yeti or a similar mic (the kind that stands vertically), check out thesesmaller pop filters ($16), which grip the head of the microphone and stay out of view a little better.
Audio Technica M50XBTA good pair of studio-style headphones will help limit mic feedback and bleed and will make you look cooler. I like theAudio-Technica M50XBT ($180)because you can pair them wirelessly with your phone or plug them into interfaces and other audio production equipment with the included cable. They sound great and last a long time, which is why you'll often see the standard, non-Bluetooth M50X in studios around the world. Other great studio standard headphones include theSony MDR 7506 ($95), andBeyerdynamic DT 770 Pro ($159).
If you're looking to mix your audio, a nice pair of open-backed headphones like theMonoprice M570 Planar headphones ($300)will help you make sure your mixes translate to different speakers and headphones.
Another option is to grab a good pair of gaming headphones. They don't sound as amazing as most dedicated USB mics, but they typically have decent sound and look good if you're streaming video games. Check out ourBest Gaming HeadsetsandBest Wireless Gaming Headsets guidesfor our current favorites.
Amazon Basics tripod boom standMany USB microphones come with built-in stands, but if you're using non-USB microphones or you want to place your mic somewhere a built-in stand doesn't allow, there are a bunch of other options. If your mic isn't too heavy, try anAmazon Basics boom stand ($25). It should be more than adequate for most people.
Always recording while sitting down at a desk? There are great mountable mic stands like thisNeewer mic adjustable arm ($24)or thisInnoGear mic arm ($16), which will make you feel like a radio DJ.
Video Gear for LivestreamsMoment lensGood video quality is integral to livestreaming. Read on for gear recommendations, from cameras and tripods to lighting.
Razer KiyoThe most essential part of a livestreaming kit is agood webcam. Our favorite for picture quality is theLogitech Brio 4K ($163), which has a nice wide-angle field of view and an amazingly sharp picture. We also like theLogitech C920X Pro($70)andRazer Kiyo($100). If you can't find a webcam you like (or one at the right price), you can also just use what you have on hand. Check out our how-to onusing your smartphone as a webcam.
Many people also have action cams or other, nicer photo gear. If you have aGoProor other DSLR or mirrorless camera, you can use it as a webcam replacement—we havean explainer on how to do it. Be aware that GoPro's software is a bit wonky and that DSLR and mirrorless cameras aren't always well-equipped to shoot videos for this long with their sensors open. You'll want a camera the manufacturer recommends for long-form videos, like theSony A7 II ($1,398).
If you need to switch between cameras or need push-button controls for your stream, check out theElgato Stream Deck ($138), whichallows you to create personal controlsfor shooting video or streaming from your desk.
SmilePowo tripod kitA small tripod that can hold your camera or smartphone is essential for properly framing shots. There are many good inexpensive ones, but thistripod kit from SmilePowo($16)should have everything you need.
Shure MV88+I've been using and enjoyingShure's microphone and tripod kit ($249)to shoot Instagram Live videos and the occasional video review for WIRED. It captures much better audio quality than the smartphone's built-in microphone and comes with a nifty tripod, so you can plop it anywhere on your desk.
This works only with iPhones and certain Android phones. I haven't had any trouble with my Google Pixel 4, but be sure that it's compatible with whatever you're using before you buy one. This kit is also great for live podcasts or outdoor video streams.
A couple of LED lamps can be the difference between a beautiful stream and an ugly one. Quality lights can be spendy, but this one fromViltrox($41)comes recommended by WIRED deals contributor Brad Bourque. WIRED associate editor Julian Chokkattu also recommends theBoling P1 ($139). We have more lighting recommendations in our guide onmaking studio-grade home videos.
If you're looking at other light options, make sure it has a temperatureandbrightness adjustment, not just one or the other. If it includes diffusers (for spreading and shaping light) or batteries (for portable use), that's a plus.
Moment lens and caseEveryone at WIRED (and nearly all fellow gear nerds we've met) are big fans ofMoment's phone cases and lenses. They're not cheap, but they can really take the images you're getting on a smartphone to the next level. If you're shooting a podcast with a static shot or find yourself using an old phone as a camera, thewide-angle lensis a good way to get everything in the scene. They're also helpful for on-the-go streams.
Moment lenses require a Moment case on your phone, but the company supports only the top brands like Apple, Google, OnePlus, and Samsung. Check whether the companymakes a casefor your phone model.
Look for a room with lots of drapes, carpet, and other soft materials that absorb sound if you're trying for that classic radio DJ sound. As a general rule, try to avoid spaces where you can hear outside noise through windows or doors.
When shooting video, it can be helpful to get blackout curtains or other devices that make your room darker, so that you can control the amount of light you want your camera to pick up.
If your software has the ability, look for equalization and compression presets that are designed for male or female voices (often in a drop-down menu). Consider using a high-pass filter, which can remove annoying low rumbles from things like refrigerators and HVAC systems. Mild compression makes the loudest parts of your recording quieter and the quietest parts louder for more even overall volume. If you don't know how to do this in your software, be sure to check out the links below.
