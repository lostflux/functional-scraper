CDS is thrilled to once again partner with DeepMind in offering a series of scholarships aimed at increasing representation of underrepresented students in higher education AI programs. Increasing representation in AI is a significant opportunity to bring diverse voices to the conversation, and ultimately shape continuing developments in AI as a technology that benefits everyone.
Obum Ekeke, University Relations and Educational Partnerships at DeepMind, said: “AI needs a diverse range of voices, perspectives and talents, and these scholarships will empower students from underrepresented backgrounds to access master’s level study in AI.”DeepMind selected New York University’s Center for Data Science as a pioneer not only in the rapidly developing field of data science, but as a leader in recruiting a diverse cohort of students and researchers (for the first time in 2019, CDS welcomed a majority female cohort to its MS in Data Science incoming class). CDS is honored to be a part of this effort to enable the next generation of AI researchers and engineers, ultimately building a stronger and more inclusive AI community.
DeepMind was NYU CDS’ first industrial partner, sponsoring over 20 CDS students to date. CDS DeepMind scholars are also offered support from a DeepMind mentor, and have opportunities to attend leading AI academic conferences and DeepMind events.
For 2022 entry, 2 fully-funded master’s scholarships will be available for CDS students from backgrounds underrepresented in AI, including DeepMind mentoring support and a grant for academic conference travel. All MS applicants are reviewed for potential scholarship opportunities. Thus, in order to be considered for the DeepMind scholarship, the only step applicants need to take is to simply apply to the program.
DeepMind is a leading artificial intelligence research company that aims to solve real-world problems and advance scientific discovery. For more information on their scholarship programs, please visitthe DeepMind website.
