#IASPGOLDCOAST2022 ‚Äì Day¬†1 - IASP
2022
https://www.iasp.info/2022/05/05/iaspgoldcoast2022-day-1

#IASPGOLDCOAST2022 ‚Äì Day 1I am excited to kick off the IASP APAC Conference 2022 blog series. It‚Äôs Day 1 ‚Äì Tuesday ‚Äì and it has been super busy already. I will do my best to give you a sense of what was addressed and what happened.
The first thing I noticed at the venue was lots of laughter and excited hugs at seeing friends in person again. I often overheard, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs great to finally meet in person‚Äù or ‚Äúyou are taller than you are on zoom!‚Äù. It was a bit like the opening scenes of Love Actually at the airport with friends and family greeting each other warmly. But that‚Äôs not surprising. As you will all know, we are a gigantic family, so it was great to replace ‚ÄúYou are still on mute‚Äù with a physical hug again.
As an early career researcher, my day started at the ECR Workshop. Spoiler ‚Äì it was terrific and memorable.
Andrew McMahon ‚Äì PhD StudentUniversity of Newcastle / EverymindTwitter: @andrewpjmcmahonThe workshop was sponsored by Youth-e: a collaboration between Orygen and the Brain and Mind Centre, so our hosts, Jo Robinson and Ian Hickie, set the scene for a great day. We commenced with eight outstanding lightning presentations. Our ECRs had only three (3) slides and five (5) minutes to tell us about their research and they did an incredible job. I can‚Äôt do them justice in the blog ‚Äì but I highly recommend looking at the live tweets at @Youthe_au ‚Äì an excellent summary of the day.
The judges had the arduous task of deciding between some fantastic presentations. Katie McGill, who shared her PhD research looking at ‚Äúhospital-treated self-harm: improving data to improve care‚Äù, was our winner for the day. Michael Wilson, who is ‚Äúexploring experiences of suicidality and help-seeking drivers among Australian men‚Äù, was our runner up. Cynthia Coombes took home the People‚Äôs Choice award for her inspiring presentation.
Following the eight incredible lightning presentations, it was time to hear from the greats who are incredibly supportive of the ECRs in our suicide prevention community. Jane Pirkis, the Editor of Crisis, made time to hold a Q&A with ECRs on the do‚Äôs, dont‚Äôs and highlights of getting published. Nothing was out of bounds, and Jane provided some excellent advice.
After some great poke bowls for lunch, the ECRs were joined by a panel of our peers. Nicholas Procter, Kerry Gibson, Myf Maple and Jane Pirkis shared with ECRs their tips for managing the ups and downs of ECR life. How to progress your careers, balance life, and deal with those difficult days when it all gets too much. Their takeaway advice was a little confusing when I wrote it here, but it does make sense ‚Äì their takeaway message was to say yes, no and maybe ‚Äì the key was to know the context.
Overall, it was an incredible workshop for the ECRs, and we hope there will be many more in the future.
As an elderly ECR still doing my PhD, I know I came away a tad overwhelmed by the fantastic knowledge and warmth of the group. Thank you.
A few hours‚Äô break to freshen up and prepare for our Opening Ceremony was greatly appreciated.
It was fabulous to see the First Nations welcome to country front and centre at the event. I know it wasn‚Äôt just me who got chills from hearing Luther‚Äôs songs of welcome and acknowledgement.
IASP‚Äôs President, in his usual loud shirt, joined us live from Glasgow. Jaelea Skehan was our MC and ably guided the welcome panel, including the WHO, National Mental Health Commission, Qld Mental Health Commission, LivingWorks, Roses in the Ocean, and Gold Coast Health.
Rory and Jo Robinson then guided us through the new and improved Opening Plenary, which was slightly different this year. Our speakers were challenged to present without the aid of slides and leave us with a few challenging ideas to create conversation over the coming days. Not surprisingly, they were up for the challenge. The incredible Pat Dudgeon was first out of the blocks, sharing the stark realities of First Nations suicide in Australia. Bronwen Edwards from Roses in the Ocean then shared four key challenges around lived experience for us to ponder. Lakshmi Vijayakumar then shared the challenges facing lower and middle-income countries and how we can ensure we bring our humanity to the solutions.
I then enjoyed the perspective of our discussants: Murad Khan, Lai Fong Chan and Leilani Darwin, who highlighted the common themes that had emerged. These include the need for compassion, humanity, collaboration and the reality that suicide prevention is an immense challenge.
At last, it was time for the Welcome Dinner. There was food, a drink or two and fabulous entertainment. As always happens at our suicide prevention conferences, the dance floor was very well used by all, especially the usual suspects ‚Ä¶ you know who you are.
A gigantic start to the conference. My tired legs were ready for a rest, so it was off to bed and a reset to get through Day 2.

#SuicidePreventionüß† Depression can affect anyone. In 2019, 37 million people in th EU were diagnosed with chronic #depression (Source: Eurostat, 2021). To combat this, better public mental health care and less stigma around mental health are needed.

Thank you @IASPinfo President @suicideresearch#IASPGOLDCOAST2022Without culturally appropriate ax measures for young Aboriginal ppl, we‚Äôll never be able to help. @MaddiOgradey from @blackdoginst not letting COVID get in the way of talking about this important work #IASPGOLDCOAST2022'They don't think it makes sense and is in a language that makes sense because we just don't have the tools available for them.' Maddison O'Grady-Lee from @blackdoginst spells out the reality for many First Nation young people who seek help. #IASPGOLDCOAST2022Dr. Emmanuel Nii-Boye Quarshie @UnivofGh says that #decriminalization of suicide, data generation, awareness raising, capacity building, and advocacy are necessary in low- and middle-income countries to prevent suicide!#IASPGOLDCOAST2022Close to 10 % of countries have a stand alone National Suicide Prevention Stratgey. Emmanual Nii -Boye Quarshie highlighting where more needs to be done to prevent suicides in lower and middle income countries. #IASPGOLDCOAST2022Media orgs: ‚ÄúAre you going beyond just safe language about suicide, & including representation of people with lived experience in media reporting about suicide, or guidelines for suicide prevention reporting, to reduce stigma and discrimination?‚Äù Stephen Scott #IASPGOLDCOAST2022‚ÄòWhere are the opportunities for you to improve, expand and strengthen the meaningful involvement of people with lived experiences?‚Äô Key questions to start our plenary sessions - thank you Stephen Scott @RosesInTheOcean #IASPGOLDCOAST2022The closing plenaries are about to conclude the final day of #IASPGOLDCOAST2022.

Chaired by @googarmstrong and @louiselasala!#IASPGOLDCOAST2022We need to require it, support it and fund it. #IASPGOLDCOAST2022 https://t.co/5buVpC7bfZThere have been some incredible examples demonstrating the value of inclusion of lived/living experience in everything we do in SP. Underlying all this work is the time, commitment, trust required. Orgs and funders have to take this time into consideration #IASPGOLDCOAST2022Post-conflict countries like Sri Lanka need to support women with better integration of domestic violence in mental health responses to tackle intimate partner violence. #IASPGOLDCOAST2022‚ÄúThrough mobilising an army of trained and supported people with a #livedexperience of suicide who provide connection, support & mutual understanding that comes from that lived experience.‚Äù - Sam Phipps, our Peer CARE Connect Coordinator speaks at #IASPGOLDCOAST2022Piumee Bandara highlights that 77% of suicides occur in lower and middle income countries and yet only 2% of research is focused here. #IASPGOLDCOAST2022The inimitable @DrSandersanOnie reflecting on suicide prevention in Indonesia and the complexity of religious beliefs and laws underpinning shame and stigma, fear and discrimination. #IASPGOLDCOAST2022Thrilled to be able to share some of the early work of my PhD looking to champion the voice of the lived experience survivor as we aim to improve our prevention efforts #IASPGOLDCOAST2022 https://t.co/EizqrxHcSMPoster on lived experience of suicide attempt by a specific method. #IASPGOLDCOAST2022The International Association for Suicide Prevention (IASP) is a 501 (c)(3) non-profit charitable organization recognized by the IRS - Status EIN 20-4701041Join Our Mailing ListWe are using cookies to give you the best experience on our website.
