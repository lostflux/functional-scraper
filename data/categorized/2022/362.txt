23 June 20212000+ km to travel by roadThe first central solenoid module is travelling 2,400 kilometres between southern California and Houston, Texas. The long trailer offers the module the lowest height profile possible (under 4.5 metres) to avoid obstacles such as bridges, wires and poles.
21 June 2021Special housing for vacuum vessel sector #1The casing for vacuum vessel sector #1(7) resembles a small cabin. As it is the second time round for Hyundai Heavy Industries (after the shipment of sector #6 in 2020) lessons learned have resulted in a more spacious cabin (to avoid clashes as the component is removed) and an easier-to-remove cover.
