"fake-h3">Key informationOverviewOur MRes in Systems and Synthetic Biology provides a platform to overcome traditional barriers and work collaboratively on the ‘big problems’ and applications in synthetic and systems biology.
The programme is delivered by the is delivered by the and is organised in association with theCentre for Integrative Systems Biology and Bioinformatics (CISBIO).
There is a link with theBIoS Centre at King’s Collegeto facilitate the integration of this research with emerging ethical, legal and societal issues.
Study programmeThis full-time programme lasts for one academic year and is made up of both taught and research-based elements.
The taught elements begin in October and last for the duration of the autumn term (October-December). This includes introductory modules that cover essentials for both life and physical scientists, as well as modules on experimental systems biology, theoretical systems biology, synthetic biology, and advanced technologies.
As well as conventional lectures, you undertake practicals, bench work, case studies, proposal writing and journal clubs.
In the spring term (January), you choose a topic for your eight-month long research project and draft a proposal to be evaluated by a student panel, before submission to supervisors. Your completed project is submitted in September of the summer term.
Close connections to industry and medicine are provided through the research projects from members of the Institute, as well as additional courses and workshops.
StructureThis page reflects the latest version of the curriculum for this year of entry. However, this information is subject to change.
The curriculum of this programme is currently being reviewed as part of a College-wide process to introduce a standardised modular structure. As a result, the content and assessment structures of this course may change for this year of entry.

StructureCore modulesYou take all of the core modules below.
Advanced TechnologyThis short lecture module covers imaging and high-throughput technologies. Imaging techniques include various forms of fluorescence microscopy, and high-throughput techniques include RNAi screens, microarrays, and microfluidic devices.
Essentials for Life ScientistsThis short lecture module introduces the basics of modelling and theoretical analysis, tailored towards students from the life sciences with limited theoretical background.
Essentials for Physical ScientistsThis short lecture and tutorial module provides an introduction to life sciences, specifically tailored for physical sciences graduates.
Experimental Systems BiologyLectures will cover signalling and gene regulatory pathways and programmes in bacteria, mammalian cells and plants.
Synthetic BiologyThis module addresses social, ethical and policy issues, such as how is science linked to society, biology in the political context, social challenges, governance and regulation.
Theoretical Systems BiologyThis lecture module covers various modelling techniques, including dynamical systems, networks and deterministic differential equations, as well as statistical approaches such as Bayesian inference.
Research projectYou take both of the modules below.
You begin work on your research project in January, when you will choose a topic and draft a proposal to be presented to a student panel. The research proposal is then assessed toward your final degree grade by your supervisors.
The project is supervised by at least two people with different expertise – one supervisor may also come from industry.
Your completed project, which accounts for 60% of your degree, is submitted during the Summer term.
