KeynotesFeatured SpeakersFormatsThemesTracksSummitsPrevious SXSW Trends2022 ThemesDiscovering the UndiscoveredCutting-edge innovation and creativity can solve many of today’s toughest problems. It wasn’t that long ago that we lived in a world where we couldn’t have imagined an invention like CRISPR could become real. Now we’re developing vaccines in record time, electric vehicle innovation is on the rise, there’s serious discussion around universal basic income, and the tools and outputs of unrestrained creativity are shaping the human experience.
Built for the FuturePeople who will be alive in the year 2100 are being born today, and they are set to inherit an uninhabitable planet. Constructing a better world is no longer a moral imperative — it’s a matter of survival, and the hunger for solutions to deep-seated problems is enormous. It’s time to accelerate change and policies must be thoughtfully designed as we look to a future that hangs in the balance.
We’re All ConnectedCovid-19 showed us the limitations of protectionist thinking in our interdependent world. Leaders around the globe are grappling with the uncertainties and inequities that have only grown during life in a pandemic. With problems that are bigger than any one country, multilateral cooperation and a long-term commitment to transparency are vital in order to effect real change.
The Evolving Media LandscapeWe have arrived at the era of synergistic mergers, the promise of a coming metaverse, and a host of new platforms that empower digital creatives. We’re also firmly entrenched in an era of unprecedented manipulation and misinformation. The recent acceleration of both of these paradigms has been extraordinary, adding more fuel to the fire for calls for increased scrutiny and regulation.
The Power of InclusivityIncorporating diverse viewpoints will help lead us to a better society, but achieving this has proved challenging. Tapping into a profound diversity of perspectives and experiences can expose alternative options, help avoid groupthink, and improve the likelihood that we will find new solutions. Harnessing this power is critical.
