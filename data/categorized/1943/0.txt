Colossus computerColossuswas a set ofcomputersdeveloped by Britishcodebreakersin the years 1943–1945[1]to help in thecryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher. Colossus usedthermionic valves (vacuum tubes)to performBooleanand counting operations. Colossus is thus regarded[2]as the world's firstprogrammable,electronic,digitalcomputer, although it was programmed by switches and plugs and not by astored program.
[3]Colossus was designed byGeneral Post Office(GPO) research telephone engineerTommy Flowers[1]to solve a problem posed by mathematicianMax Newmanat theGovernment Code and Cypher School(GC&CS) atBletchley Park.
Alan Turing's use of probability in cryptanalysis (seeBanburismus) contributed to its design. It has sometimes been erroneously stated that Turing designed Colossus to aid thecryptanalysis of the Enigma.
[4](Turing's machine that helped decodeEnigmawas the electromechanicalBombe, not Colossus.)[5]The prototype,Colossus Mark 1, was shown to be working in December 1943 and was in use at Bletchley Park by early 1944.
[1]An improvedColossus Mark 2that usedshift registersto quintuple the processing speed, first worked on 1 June 1944, just in time for theNormandy landingson D-Day.
[6]Ten Colossi were in use by the end of the war and an eleventh was being commissioned.
[6]Bletchley Park's use of these machines allowed theAlliesto obtain a vast amount of high-levelmilitary intelligencefrom interceptedradiotelegraphymessages between theGerman High Command(OKW) and theirarmycommands throughout occupied Europe.
The existence of the Colossus machines was kept secret until the mid-1970s.
[7][8]All but two machines were dismantled into such small parts that their use could not be inferred. The two retained machines were eventually dismantled in the 1960s. A functioning rebuild of a Mark 2 Colossus was completed in 2008 byTony Saleand a team of volunteers; it is on display atThe National Museum of ComputingonBletchley Park.
[9][10][11]ContentsPurpose and origins[edit]The Colossus computers were used to help decipher intercepted radioteleprintermessages that had beenencryptedusing an unknown device. Intelligence information revealed that the Germans called the wireless teleprinter transmission systems"Sägefisch"(sawfish). This led the British to call encrypted German teleprinter traffic "Fish",[13]and the unknown machine and its intercepted messages "Tunny" (tunafish).
[14]Before the Germans increased the security of their operating procedures, British cryptanalystsdiagnosedhow the unseen machine functioned and built an imitation of it called "British Tunny".
It was deduced that the machine had twelve wheels and used aVernam cipheringtechnique on message characters in the standard 5-bitITA2telegraph code. It did this by combining theplaintextcharacters with a stream ofkeycharacters using theXORBoolean functionto produce theciphertext.
In August 1941, a blunder by German operators led to the transmission of two versions of the same message with identical machine settings. These were intercepted and worked on at Bletchley Park. First,John Tiltman, a very talented GC&CS cryptanalyst, derived akey streamof almost 4000 characters.
[15]ThenBill Tutte, a newly arrived member of the Research Section, used this keystream to work out the logical structure of the Lorenz machine. He deduced that the twelve wheels consisted of two groups of five, which he named the χ (chi) and ψ (psi) wheels, the remaining two he called μ (mu) or "motor" wheels. Thechiwheels stepped regularly with each letter that was encrypted, while thepsiwheels stepped irregularly, under the control of the motor wheels.
[16]With a sufficiently random keystream, a Vernam cipher removes the natural language property of a plaintext message of having an unevenfrequency distributionof the different characters, to produce a uniform distribution in the ciphertext. The Tunny machine did this well. However, the cryptanalysts worked out that by examining the frequency distribution of the character-to-character changes in the ciphertext, instead of the plain characters, there was a departure from uniformity which provided a way into the system. This was achieved by"differencing"in which each bit or character was XOR-ed with its successor.
[17]After Germany surrendered, allied forces captured a Tunny machine and discovered that it was theelectromechanicalLorenz SZ(Schlüsselzusatzgerät, cipher attachment) in-line cipher machine.
[13]In order to decrypt the transmitted messages, two tasks had to be performed. The first was "wheel breaking", which was the discovery of the cam patterns for all the wheels. These patterns were set up on the Lorenz machine and then used for a fixed period of time for a succession of different messages. Each transmission, which often contained more than one message, was enciphered with a different start position of the wheels. Alan Turing invented a method of wheel-breaking that became known asTuringery.
[18]Turing's technique was further developed into "Rectangling", for which Colossus could produce tables for manual analysis. Colossi 2, 4, 6, 7 and 9 had a "gadget" to aid this process.
[19]The second task was"wheel setting", which worked out the start positions of the wheels for a particular message and could only be attempted once the cam patterns were known.
[20]It was this task for which Colossus was initially designed. To discover the start position of thechiwheels for a message, Colossus compared two character streams, counting statistics from the evaluation of programmable Boolean functions. The two streams were the ciphertext, which was read at high speed from a paper tape, and the keystream, which was generated internally, in a simulation of the unknown German machine. After a succession of different Colossus runs to discover the likelychi-wheel settings, they were checked by examining the frequency distribution of the characters in the processed ciphertext.
[21]Colossus produced these frequency counts.
Decryption processes[edit]By using differencing and knowing that thepsiwheels did not advance with each character, Tutte worked out that trying just two differenced bits (impulses) of thechi-stream against the differenced ciphertext would produce a statistic that was non-random. This became known asTutte's "1+2 break in".
[25]It involved calculating the following Boolean function:and counting the number of times it yielded "false" (zero). If this number exceeded a pre-defined threshold value known as the "set total", it was printed out. The cryptanalyst would examine the printout to determine which of the putative start positions was most likely to be the correct one for thechi-1 andchi-2 wheels.
[26]This technique would then be applied to other pairs of, or single, impulses to determine the likely start position of all fivechiwheels. From this, the de-chi(D) of a ciphertext could be obtained, from which thepsicomponent could be removed by manual methods.
[27]If the frequency distribution of characters in the de-chiversion of the ciphertext was within certain bounds, "wheel setting" of thechiwheels was considered to have been achieved,[21]and the message settings and de-chiwere passed to the "Testery". This was the section at Bletchley Park led by MajorRalph Testerwhere the bulk of the decrypting work was done by manual and linguistic methods.
[28]Colossus could also derive the start position of thepsiand motor wheels, but this was not much done until the last few months of the war when there were plenty of Colossi available and the number of Tunny messages had declined.
Design and construction[edit]Colossus was developed for the "Newmanry",[29]the section headed by the mathematicianMax Newmanthat was responsible for machine methods against the twelve-rotorLorenz SZ40/42 on-line teleprinter cipher machine(code-named Tunny, for tunafish). The Colossus design arose out of a prior project that produced a counting machine dubbed "Heath Robinson". Although it proved the concept of machine analysis for this part of the process, it was initially unreliable. The electro-mechanical parts were relatively slow and it was difficult to synchronise two loopedpaper tapes, one containing the enciphered message, and the other representing part of the keystream of the Lorenz machine,[30]also the tapes tended to stretch when being read at up to 2000 characters per second.
Tommy FlowersMBE[d]was a senior electrical engineer and Head of the Switching Group at thePost Office Research StationatDollis Hill. Prior to his work on Colossus, he had been involved with GC&CS at Bletchley Park from February 1941 in an attempt to improve theBombesthat were used in the cryptanalysis of the German Enigma cipher machine.
[32]He was recommended to Max Newman by Alan Turing, who had been impressed by his work on the Bombes.
[33]The main components of the Heath Robinson machine were as follows.
Flowers had been brought in to design the Heath Robinson's combining unit.
[34]He was not impressed by the system of a key tape that had to be kept synchronised with the message tape and, on his own initiative, he designed an electronic machine which eliminated the need for the key tape by having an electronic analogue of the Lorenz (Tunny) machine.
[35]He presented this design to Max Newman in February 1943, but the idea that the one to two thousand thermionic valves (vacuum tubesandthyratrons) proposed, could work together reliably, was greeted with great scepticism,[36]so more Robinsons were ordered from Dollis Hill. Flowers, however, knew from his pre-war work that most thermionic valve failures occurred as a result of the thermal stresses at power-up, so not powering a machine down reduced failure rates to very low levels.
[37]Additionally, if the heaters were started at a low voltage then slowly brought up to full voltage, thermal stress was reduced. The valves themselves could be soldered-in to avoid problems with plug-in bases, which could be unreliable.
[citation needed]Flowers persisted with the idea and obtained support from the Director of the Research Station, W Gordon Radley.
[38]Flowers and his team of some fifty people in the switching group[39][40]spent eleven months from early February 1943 designing and building a machine that dispensed with the second tape of the Heath Robinson, by generating the wheel patterns electronically. Flowers used some of his own money for the project.
[41][42]This prototype, Mark 1 Colossus, contained 1,600 thermionic valves (tubes).
[39]It performed satisfactorily at Dollis Hill on 8 December 1943[43]and was dismantled and shipped to Bletchley Park, where it was delivered on 18 January and re-assembled byHarry Fensomand Don Horwood.
[11][44]It was operational in January[45][8]and it successfully attacked its first message on 5 February 1944.
[46]It was a large structure and was dubbed 'Colossus', supposedly by theWRNSoperators. However, a memo held in the National Archives written by Max Newman on 18 January 1944 records that 'Colossus arrives today".
[47]During the development of the prototype, an improved design had been developed – the Mark 2 Colossus. Four of these were ordered in March 1944 and by the end of April the number on order had been increased to twelve. Dollis Hill was put under pressure to have the first of these working by 1 June.
[48]Allen Coombstook over leadership of the production Mark 2 Colossi, the first of which – containing 2,400 valves – became operational at 08:00 on 1 June 1944, just in time for the AlliedInvasion of NormandyonD-Day.
[49]Subsequently, Colossi were delivered at the rate of about one a month. By the time ofV-E Daythere were ten Colossi working at Bletchley Park and a start had been made on assembling an eleventh.
[48]The main units of the Mark 2 design were as follows.
[35][50]Most of the design of the electronics was the work of Tommy Flowers, assisted by William Chandler, Sidney Broadhurst and Allen Coombs; with Erie Speight andArnold Lynchdeveloping the photoelectric reading mechanism.
[51]Coombs remembered Flowers, having produced a rough draft of his design, tearing it into pieces that he handed out to his colleagues for them to do the detailed design and get their team to manufacture it.
[52]The Mark 2 Colossi were both five times faster and were simpler to operate than the prototype.
[e]Data input to Colossus was byphotoelectricreading of a paper tape transcription of the enciphered intercepted message. This was arranged in a continuous loop so that it could be read and re-read multiple times – there being no internal storage for the data. The design overcame the problem of synchronizing the electronics with the speed of the message tape by generating aclock signalfrom reading its sprocket holes. The speed of operation was thus limited by the mechanics of reading the tape. During development, the tape reader was tested up to 9700 characters per second (53 mph) before the tape disintegrated. So 5000 characters/second (40 ft/s (12.2 m/s; 27.3 mph)) was settled on as the speed for regular use. Flowers designed a 6-character shift register, which was used both for computing the delta function (ΔZ) and for testing five different possible starting points of Tunny's wheels in the five processors.
[54][55]This five-way parallelism[f]enabled five simultaneous tests and counts to be performed giving an effective processing speed of 25,000 characters per second.
[55]The computation used algorithms devised byW. T. Tutteand colleagues to decrypt a Tunny message.
[56][57]Operation[edit]The Newmanry was staffed by cryptanalysts, operators from theWomen's Royal Naval Service (WRNS)– known as "Wrens" – and engineers who were permanently on hand for maintenance and repair. By the end of the war the staffing was 272 Wrens and 27 men.
[48]The first job in operating Colossus for a new message was to prepare the paper tape loop. This was performed by the Wrens who stuck the two ends together usingBostikglue, ensuring that there was a 150-character length of blank tape between the end and the start of the message.
[58]Using a special hand punch they inserted a start hole between the third and fourth channels.mw-parser-output .frac{white-space:nowrap}.mw-parser-output .frac .num,.mw-parser-output .frac .den{font-size:80%;line-height:0;vertical-align:super}.mw-parser-output .frac .den{vertical-align:sub}.mw-parser-output .sr-only{border:0;clip:rect(0,0,0,0);height:1px;margin:-1px;overflow:hidden;padding:0;position:absolute;width:1px}2+1⁄2sprocket holes from the end of the blank section, and a stop hole between the fourth and fifth channels1+1⁄2sprocket holes from the end of the characters of the message.
[59][60]These were read by specially positioned photocells and indicated when the message was about to start and when it ended. The operator would then thread the paper tape through the gate and around the pulleys of the bedstead and adjust the tension. The two-tape bedstead design had been carried on from Heath Robinson so that one tape could be loaded whilst the previous one was being run. A switch on the Selection Panel specified the "near" or the "far" tape.
[61]After performing various resetting and zeroizing tasks, the Wren operators would, under instruction from the cryptanalyst, operate the "set total" decade switches and the K2 panel switches to set the desired algorithm. They would then start the bedstead tape motor and lamp and, when the tape was up to speed, operate the master start switch.
[61]Programming[edit]Howard Campaigne, a mathematician and cryptanalyst from the US Navy'sOP-20-G, wrote the following in a foreword to Flowers' 1983 paper "The Design of Colossus".
.mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0}My view of Colossus was that of cryptanalyst-programmer. I told the machine to make certain calculations and counts, and after studying the results, told it to do another job. It did not remember the previous result, nor could it have acted upon it if it did. Colossus and I alternated in an interaction that sometimes achieved an analysis of an unusual German cipher system, called "Geheimschreiber" by the Germans, and "Fish" by the cryptanalysts.
[62]Colossus was not astored-program computer. The input data for the five parallel processors was read from the looped message paper tape and the electronic pattern generators for thechi,psiand motor wheels.
[63]The programs for the processors were set and held on the switches and jack panel connections. Each processor could evaluate a Boolean function and count and display the number of times it yielded the specified value of "false" (0) or "true" (1) for each pass of the message tape.
Input to the processors came from two sources, the shift registers from tape reading and the thyratron rings that emulated the wheels of the Tunny machine.
[64]The characters on the paper tape were calledZand the characters from the Tunny emulator were referred to by the Greek letters that Bill Tutte had given them when working out the logical structure of the machine. On the selection panel, switches specified eitherZorΔZ, eitherχ{\displaystyle \chi }orΔχ{\displaystyle \chi }and eitherψ{\displaystyle \psi }orΔψ{\displaystyle \psi }for the data to be passed to the jack field and 'K2 switch panel'. These signals from the wheel simulators could be specified as stepping on with each new pass of the message tape or not.
The K2 switch panel had a group of switches on the left-hand side to specify the algorithm. The switches on the right-hand side selected the counter to which the result was fed. The plugboard allowed less specialized conditions to be imposed. Overall the K2 switch panel switches and the plugboard allowed about five billion different combinations of the selected variables.
[58]As an example: a set of runs for a message tape might initially involve twochiwheels, as in Tutte's 1+2 algorithm. Such a two-wheel run was called a long run, taking on average eight minutes unless the parallelism was utilised to cut the time by a factor of five. The subsequent runs might only involve setting onechiwheel, giving a short run taking about two minutes. Initially, after the initial long run, the choice of the next algorithm to be tried was specified by the cryptanalyst. Experience showed, however, that decision trees for this iterative process could be produced for use by the Wren operators in a proportion of cases.
[65]Influence and fate[edit]Although the Colossus was the first of the electronic digital machines with programmability, albeit limited by modern standards,[66]it was not a general-purpose machine, being designed for a range of cryptanalytic tasks, most involving counting the results of evaluating Boolean algorithms.
A Colossus computer was thus not a fullyTuring completemachine. However,University of San Franciscoprofessor Benjamin Wells has shown that if all ten Colossus machines made were rearranged in a specificcluster, then the entire set of computers could have simulated auniversal Turing machine, and thus be Turing complete.
[67]The notion of a computer as a general-purpose machine – that is, as more than acalculatordevoted to solving difficult but specific problems – did not become prominent until after World War II.
[citation needed]Colossus and the reasons for its construction were highly secret and remained so for 30 years after the War. Consequently, it was not included in thehistory of computing hardwarefor many years, and Flowers and his associates were deprived of the recognition they were due. Colossi 1 to 10 were dismantled after the war and parts returned to the Post Office. Some parts, sanitised as to their original purpose, were taken to Max Newman'sRoyal SocietyComputing Machine LaboratoryatManchester University.
[68]Tommy Flowers was ordered to destroy all documentation and burnt them in a furnace at Dollis Hill. He later said of that order:That was a terrible mistake. I was instructed to destroy all the records, which I did. I took all the drawings and the plans and all the information about Colossus on paper and put it in the boiler fire. And saw it burn.
[69]Colossi 11 and 12, along with two replica Tunny machines, were retained, being moved toGCHQ's new headquarters atEastcotein April 1946, and again with GCHQ toCheltenhambetween 1952 and 1954.
[70]One of the Colossi, known asColossus Blue, was dismantled in 1959; the other in 1960.
[70]There had been attempts to adapt them to other purposes, with varying success; in their later years they had been used for training.
[71]Jack Goodrelated how he was the first to use Colossus after the war, persuading the USNational Security Agencythat it could be used to perform a function for which they were planning to build a special-purpose machine.
[70]Colossus was also used to perform character counts onone-time padtape to test for non-randomness.
[70]A small number of people who were associated with Colossus—and knew that large-scale, reliable, high-speed electronic digital computing devices were feasible—played significant roles in early computer work in the UK and probably in the US. However, being so secret, it had little direct influence on the development of later computers; it wasEDVACthat was the seminal computer architecture of the time.
[72]In 1972,Herman Goldstine, who was unaware of Colossus and its legacy to the projects of people such as Alan Turing (ACE), Max Newman (Manchester computers) andHarry Huskey(Bendix G-15), wrote that,Britain had such vitality that it could immediately after the war embark on so many well-conceived and well-executed projects in the computer field.
[73]ProfessorBrian Randell, who unearthed information about Colossus in the 1970s, commented on this, saying that:It is my opinion that the COLOSSUS project was an important source of this vitality, one that has been largely unappreciated, as has the significance of its places in the chronology of the invention of the digital computer.
[74]Randell's efforts started to bear fruit in the mid-1970s, after the secrecy about Bletchley Park was broken whenGroup Captain Winterbothampublished his bookThe Ultra Secretin 1974.
[75]In October 2000, a 500-page technical report on the Tunny cipher and its cryptanalysis—entitledGeneral Report on Tunny[76]—was released by GCHQ to the nationalPublic Record Office, and it contains a fascinatingpaeanto Colossus by the cryptographers who worked with it:It is regretted that it is not possible to give an adequate idea of the fascination of a Colossus at work; its sheer bulk and apparent complexity; the fantastic speed of thin paper tape round the glittering pulleys; the childish pleasure of not-not, span, print main header and other gadgets; the wizardry of purely mechanical decoding letter by letter (one novice thought she was being hoaxed); the uncanny action of the typewriter in printing the correct scores without and beyond human aid; the stepping of the display; periods of eager expectation culminating in the sudden appearance of the longed-for score; and the strange rhythms characterizing every type of run: the stately break-in, the erratic short run, the regularity of wheel-breaking, the stolid rectangle interrupted by the wild leaps of the carriage-return, the frantic chatter of a motor run, even the ludicrous frenzy of hosts of bogus scores.
[77]Reconstruction[edit]Construction of a fully functional rebuild[78][79]of a Colossus Mark 2 was undertaken between 1993 and 2008 by a team led by Tony Sale.
[11][10]In spite of the blueprints and hardware being destroyed, a surprising amount of material survived, mainly in engineers' notebooks, but a considerable amount of it in the U.S. The optical tape reader might have posed the biggest problem, butDr. Arnold Lynch, its original designer was able to redesign it to his own original specification. The reconstruction is on display, in the historically correct place for Colossus No. 9, atThe National Museum of Computing, in H BlockBletchley ParkinMilton Keynes, Buckinghamshire.
In November 2007, to celebrate the project completion and to mark the start of a fundraising initiative for The National Museum of Computing, a Cipher Challenge[80]pitted the rebuilt Colossus against radio amateurs worldwide in being first to receive and decode three messages enciphered using theLorenz SZ42and transmitted from radio station DL0HNF in theHeinz Nixdorf MuseumsForumcomputer museum. The challenge was easily won byradio amateurJoachim Schüth, who had carefully prepared[81]for the event and developed his own signal processing and code-breaking code usingAda.
[82]The Colossus team were hampered by their wish to use World War II radio equipment,[83]delaying them by a day because of poor reception conditions. Nevertheless, the victor's 1.4 GHz laptop, running his own code, took less than a minute to find the settings for all 12 wheels. The German codebreaker said: "My laptop digested ciphertext at a speed of 1.2 million characters per second—240 times faster than Colossus. If you scale the CPU frequency by that factor, you get an equivalent clock of 5.8 MHz for Colossus. That is a remarkable speed for a computer built in 1944."[84]The Cipher Challenge verified the successful completion of the rebuild project. "On the strength of today's performance Colossus is as good as it was six decades ago", commented Tony Sale. "We are delighted to have produced a fitting tribute to the people who worked at Bletchley Park and whose brainpower devised these fantastic machines which broke these ciphers and shortened the war by many months."[85]Other meanings[edit]There was a fictional computer namedColossusin the 1970 filmColossus: The Forbin Projectwhich was based on the 1966 novelColossusbyD. F. Jones. This was a coincidence as it pre-dates the public release of information about Colossus, or even its name.
Neal Stephenson's novelCryptonomicon(1999) also contains a fictional treatment of the historical role played by Turing and Bletchley Park.
