This horrifying condition also occurs as a consequence of a progressive neurological disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, which involves progressive degeneration of all the motor neurons of the somatic motor system. These ‘locked-in’ patients ultimately become unable to express themselves and to communicate even their most basic wishes or desires, as they can no longer control their muscles to activate communication devices. We have developed a new means of communication for the completely paralysed that uses slow cortical potentials (SCPs) of the electro-encephalogram to drive an electronic spelling device.

MainThe neurophysiological basis and behavioural functions of SCPs have been described2, and operant conditioning has been used to bring them under voluntary control. We have shaped the voluntary control of SCPs in two locked-in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis who were able to learn to operate a spelling device by regulating their brain responses. The spelling device drives a cursor on a video screen, allowing the subjects to select letters of the alphabet. Previous interfaces between brains and computers have used different brain responses, such as certain frequency bins or event-related brain potentials3,4, but these have not yet been tested with locked-in patients.
Both subjects suffer from advanced amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and have been artificially respirated and fed for four years. Sustained voluntary control of the musculature was not possible in either patient, so they were unable to use a muscle-driven communication device. They were trained to produce changes voluntarily in their SCPs lasting 2-4 seconds. Each trial consisted of a 2-second baseline and a response period lasting 2-4 seconds, the length of which was adapted to suit the patient. A training day consisted of 6-12 sessions (depending on the condition of the patient), each of which comprised about 70 to 100 trials and lasted about 5-10 minutes.
During the response period, the subjects were required to produce either negativity or positivity greater than a specific criterion amplitude in random order. The baseline and response periods were signalled by two clearly different tones, and whether positivity or negativity was required was indicated by a box being highlighted in either the upper (negativity) or the lower (positivity) half of the screen. Visual feedback of SCPs, which was updated every 64 ms, was provided by a ball that moved towards or away from the box, depending on the direction in which the SCP deviated from baseline. The response criterion was progressively increased from 5 to 8 µV.
SCPs were extracted from the regular electroencephalogram using a time constant of 8 s and a low-pass filter of 40 Hz. They were recorded from the vertex relative to linked mastoids at a sampling rate of 256 Hz. Vertical eye movements were simultaneously recorded with standard on-line removal of eye-movement artefacts2. Using an imagery strategy5, both patients were better able to produce positivity than negativity, so training for negativity was soon discontinued. As soon as a stable performance of at least 75% correct (hitting the goal for at least 500 ms) responses at the 8-µV level was achieved, the patients began to work with the spelling device. Subject A achieved this level after 327 sessions and subject B achieved it after 288 sessions (Fig. 1).
Subject A began with feedback training of SCP amplitude (initial and advanced training; 71.3% correct selections, 75.0% correct rejections, based on ‘go-back’ responses), proceeded to copy spelling (copying of letters and then words; 78.7%, 75.3%) and finally to free spelling (self-selected letters; 66.4%, 82.9%). Subject B began with initial training, then switched to a combination of advanced training (77.5%, 68.8%) and copy spelling (77.5%, 67.6%) and finally to free spelling (86.2%, 73.7%).
For the spelling program at level 1, the alphabet was split into two halves (letter banks) which were presented successively at the bottom of the screen for 4.5 seconds (subject A) or 6 seconds (subject B). If the subject selected the letter bank being shown by generating a SCP, it was split into two new halves, and so on until each of the two letter banks had only one letter in it. When one of the two final letters was selected, it was displayed in the top text field of the screen and then the selection began again at level 1. A ‘go back’ function, which appeared as an option when two successive letter banks had not been selected, allowed the speller to go back one step to the previous set of letter banks. If the speller was at level 1, selecting this function erased the last symbol written in the text field, so mistakes could be corrected. This procedure was chosen after extensive pilot work6involving different types of speller.
The accuracy of responses during feedback training, copy spelling and free spelling is shown inFig. 1for both patients over the course of 446 (subject A) and 308 sessions (subject B). Two types of error were possible: incorrect rejection was due to the SCP amplitude being too low, and incorrect selection occurred when a high SCP was made in the presence of a wrong letter or row of letters. Both subjects can now write messages. The first full message written entirely by the brain of subject A is shown inFig. 2.
The first full message written by subject A.
Our data indicate that patients who lack muscular control can learn to control variations in their SCPs sufficiently accurately to operate an electronic spelling device. Although writing sentences is time consuming — subject A took 16 hours to write the message inFig. 2, a rate of about 2 characters per minute — it is reliable and precise enough to allow the patient to communicate with his or her environment. These completely paralysed individuals now have the ability to communicate, a possibility that has not previously existed for such severely affected patients.
