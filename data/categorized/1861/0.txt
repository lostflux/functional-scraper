Testing the Proto-Mayan-Mije-Sokean Hypothesis1University of North Carolina, Chapel HillSearch for more articles by this authorAbstractThis paper tests the hypothesis of a common ancestor for the Mayan and Mije-Sokean languages. It applies the Comparative Method to a data set of Proto-Mayan and Proto-Mije-Sokean comparanda compiled following strict criteria for the selection of comparanda, including wide distribution of the forms within each of the language families, semantic isomorphism, and biconsonantal correspondences. Loanwords have been reviewed and compiled, and their sound correspondences isolated, to serve as a control in the process of identification of sound correspondences among the potential cognates. Due to the limited data set, the focus of the comparative analysis lies with consonantal correspondences. It is shown that many consonantal correspondences exhibit sufficient recurrence and sufficient phonetic distance from the consonantal correspondences attested in the loanword data set to support a Proto-Mayan-Mijesokean hypothesis. Also, a few etyma can be traced as probable cognates and also as later loanwords, also supporting the hypothesis. It is concluded that the hypothesis is plausible, although not yet verified. The most difficult task at hand remains to distinguish between a situation of common descent and one of extensive archaic diffusion. A discussion of the problems inherent to long-range comparison is offered, as well as potential cultural historical implications. The paper concludes with a summary and an outline of desiderata for further testing of this hypothesis.
1. IntroductionThis paper examines new evidence testing the remote relationship between the Mayan and Mije-Sokean languages.
2The primary objectives are to identify forms that are comparable; to explore the nature of their similarities in order to isolate the ones that are likely the result of a true historical relationship, whether as loans or cognates; to determine the possibility of distinguishing between loans and cognates; and to address the analytical problems inherent in comparing two languages, Proto-Mayan (pMa) and Proto-Mije-Sokean (pMiSo), that are so drastically different in terms of their consonantal inventories, the former reconstructed with 26 consonants, the latter with a mere 11.
Previously, several authors have entertained a phylolinguistic relationship between the Mayan and Mije-Sokean languages, going as far back as the nineteenth century (Squier1861).
3Radin (1916;1919;1924) utilized lexical and grammatical data from Mije-Sokean, Wave (a.k.a. Huave, Wavi [ISO codes: hve, hue, huv, hvv]), and Mayan languages to argue for a relationship of shared descent. Independently of Radin, Sapir (1949a/1916;1949b/1929) proposed a relationship between the Penutian family proposed by Dixon and Kroeber (1913a;1913b;1919) and several languages of Mexico, among them Mije-Sokean and Wave, as well Xinkan (a.k.a. Xincan [ISO code: xin]) and Lenkan (a.k.a. Lencan [ISO code: len]), in what became known as the “Mexican Penutian” branch of “Macro-Penutian.” Freeland (1930) followed with a comparison of Mijean and Penutian, utilizing primarily lexical data. Whorf (1935) and Whorf and Trager (1937) further added Uto-Aztecan and Kiowa(-Tanoan), as well as Totonakan, into the mix. McQuown (1942;1956) defined the hypothetical ancestor of Mayan, Mije-Sokean, and Totonakan as “Macro-Mayan,” and further promoted the hypothesis. His hypothesis relied on the presence of “a glottalized series” of consonants in both Mayan and Totonakan to suggest their common descent, but McQuown admitted that “the relatively small number of coincidences in vocabulary indicates to us that this kinship is quite distant” (1942:37–38). Swadesh (1954;1956) continued the expansion of Penutian into “Penutoid,” a phylum defined on the basis of lexicostatistical evidence. Arana (1964;1968) also applied lexicostatistics to a Swadesh list for several Mayan, Mije-Sokean, and Totonakan languages, among others, assuming the validity of their relationship. Most of these authors did not present systematic analyses of sound correspondences but merely cases of similarities in lexical data, often with significant semantic leeway; and most authors also carried out comparisons between selected individual languages as representatives of entire language families, a method that increases the likelihood of chance similarities. In fact, some of the authors did not offer any concrete data but merely remarks concerning general structural similarities. And a few of the authors only applied lexicostatistics and glottochronology, methods that cannot be used to test and establish relationships of shared descent between languages.
A few more studies were carried out to test the hypothesis and also attempted to compare earlier stages of each language family to one another, not just individual languages as representatives. Kaufman (1964a:131–35), assuming the correctness of the Macro-Mayan hypothesis by McQuown (1942;1956), offered some remarks on the matter and even suggested that some phonologically similar forms in Mayan and Mije-Sokean could be cognates, as discussed below. Not long after, in an unpublished study, Kaufman (1964b) carried out a comparison of Totonakan, Mayan, and Mije-Sokean; as Campbell and Kaufman (1980:852) recount, such comparison involved “about 140 possible cognate sets,” many of which “occurred in only two of the three language families; more were between Totonacan and Mixe-Zoquean,” but the evaluation of the sound correspondences did not lead to a viable “Proto-Macro-Mayan sound system.” Next, Fox (1978), who assumed the validity of the Mexican Penutian hypothesis, carried out a study of Proto-Mayan phonology in which he utilized 42 Mije-Sokean lexical and grammatical items as external points of comparison to evaluate the Proto-Mayan reconstructions. And soon after, Brown and Witkowski (1979) published a paper proposing a “Maya–Zoquean” relationship on the basis of 62 cognate sets, and an analysis of a limited set of sound correspondences involving the Mayan velar and uvular plain and ejective stops. Campbell and Kaufman (1980;1983) rejected the methodology and results applied by Brown and Witkowski (1979), and in fact by most previous studies on the matter, and outlined a series of requirements for carrying out long-range comparisons. These have since been elaborated on in Campbell (1997) and especially Campbell and Poser (2008), who have also rejected previous attempts to demonstrate the Macro-Mayan and Maya–Zoquean hypotheses but have concluded that such hypotheses deserve further research.
4This paper evaluates previous data, presents new data, and systematically applies the Comparative Method to test for the existence of regular sound correspondences.
Section2reviews and outlines the theoretical assumptions and methodological procedure to be applied in this study.
Section3sets up a series of correspondences between established or suspected loanwords in order to facilitate the evaluation of possible cognates.
Section4then evaluates the sound correspondences among lexical and grammatical morphemes compiled for this paper and proposes reconstructions for a number of such correspondences.
Section5examines a few patterns of possible relevance for morphological comparison and reconstruction.
Section6discusses a variety of issues raised by this study and recent similar studies and outlines some of the necessary steps that should be taken in future work. Finally,section7offers a series of conclusions, most importantly among them that a relationship of common descent from an ancestral language of the Mayan and Mije-Sokean language families, referred to as Proto-Mayan-Mijesokean, can be supported,tentatively, given the identification of regular correspondences, including several not attested among loanwords. Alternatively, the data could be interpreted as evidence for a scenario of significant archaic diffusion between Proto-Mayan and Proto-Mije-Sokean, a result that would be highly significant in and of itself. However, much work remains to be done with the analysis of the vocalic correspondences, and additional comparanda must be sought and analyzed, in order to assess which scenario provides a more parsimonious account of the patterns.
2. Methodology and assumptionsThis section describes the methodology and assumptions applied in this paper.
2.1. Sources of dataThe two major sources of data are Kaufman (2003) for Mayan, with 659 Proto-Mayan etyma and approximately 168 Proto-Central Mayan etyma, and Wichmann (1995) for Mije-Sokean, with 699 Proto-Mije-Sokean reconstructions, 451 Proto-Mijean reconstructions, and 382 Proto-Sokean reconstructions. Elson (1992), Kaufman and Norman (1984), and Kaufman (2003) were also consulted for Mije-Sokean etyma (lexical and grammatical); the latter two works systematically offer comparisons between Mayan and Mije-Sokean etyma, sometimes suggesting diffusion but other times not specifying what type of relationship, if any, could lie behind the similarities. Furthermore, Kaufman (2007) has also served as an important source, given his documentation of Mije-Sokean etyma in Central Mexico, which he correlates with a hypothetical and extinct branch of Mije-Sokean, Northern Mije-Sokean, described below.
52.2. Selection of comparandaI began by reviewing two approaches to the problem, namely, those by Fox (1978) and Brown and Witkowski (1979). I also reviewed Campbell and Kaufman (1980), who responded very strongly and negatively to Brown and Witkowski, followed by Witkowski and Brown’s (1981) rejoinder, itself followed by Campbell and Kaufman’s (1983) final response. More details on these contributions and critiques are provided inAppendix G, available online only. After examining the data sets in Fox (1978) and Brown and Witkowski (1979) against Campbell and Kaufman’s (1980;1983) critiques, a few items remained potentially viable, pending validation based on more recent and comprehensive sources (Wichmann1995and Kaufman2003). These became my starting point.
In order to minimize the risk of chance similarities as well as the risk of inadvertently sampling loanwords, the following restrictions and desiderata, outlined in Campbell and Kaufman (1980;1983) and further elaborated on in Campbell (1997:224–40) and Campbell and Poser (2008:163–212), have been considered. These include (seeAppendix H, available online only, for a more detailed discussion):(1)Distribution of the comparanda within each of the language families being compared(2)Semantic isomorphism(3)Phonological distance(4)Factors that increase risk of similarities not due to cognacy (loans, sound symbolism, widespread forms, nursery forms, chance similarities, comparison of short sequences, unmatched segments)(5)Factors that can obscure actual cognacy (analogy, sound symbolism)Regarding the first restriction, the distribution of the data within each language family, I have only sampled etyma reconstructible to pMa, LpMa, or pCMa, on the Mayan side, and pMiSo, pMi, and pSo, on the Mije-Sokean side. Regarding the second, I have also attempted to utilize only forms exhibiting semantic isomorphism. And regarding phonological distance and the risk of similarities due to diffusion, I have assembled all previously proposed loans involving Mayan and Mije-Sokean languages in the literature on Mesoamerican language contact, found a few additional cases that seem promising as loans, and attempted to isolate sound correspondences that are documented among possible loans, in order to check against the sound correspondences attested in the data set to which the Comparative Method is applied. I have also paid attention to sound correspondences that do not seem unusual, those that seem a bit unusual, and have left out of the analysis those that seem too far-fetched at the present stage of analysis. Regarding loans, it should be added that it is possible that some loans, especially archaic loans, could appear to be cognates and even exhibit regular sound correspondences similar to those present among potential cognates. At this point there is little that can be done to avoid these, except isolating a few cases of forms that are widespread in both language families and have in fact been proposed to be loans in the past.
Regarding factors that increase risk of similarity not due to cognacy, in addition to loans, I have attempted to avoid sound-symbolic forms, especially onomatopoeia, which could lead to independently innovated but similar forms. There is a chance that synesthetic sound-symbolism (Hinton, Nichols, and Ohala1994:4) or systematic onomatopoeia (Hock1991:177), an analogical process, could lead to the independently innovated forms that are similar, but it could also lead, as does analogy more generally, to changes in actual cognates, making them appear less similar. A few likely onomatopoeic forms have been retained but not included in the primary analysis.
As far as minimizing the risks of accidental similarities, I have also avoided the comparison of unmatched sequences of segments; more specifically, I have only compared lexical etyma of CVC … shapes that exhibit at least two comparable consonants, i.e., biconsonantal correspondences, where both C1and C2in the Mayan and Mije-Sokean C1VC2… shapes under examination are comparable. I have thus avoided the comparison and analysis of short sequences, e.g., the case of pMa *ʔil‘to see’ and pMiSo *ʔis‘to see’, due to the fact that the second consonant in each case is difficult to compare, even though I suspect the two forms are related. The same applies to pMa *xul∼ *xool‘hole’, which bears a similarity to pMiSo *hut‘to pierce’ and pOMi *hut‘hole’.
6I have included a few instances of unmatched sequences of segments but only when morphological analysis allows one to isolate a comparable sequence from a non-comparable sequence. For example, A25, pMa *tuuk: pMiSo *tuu¢[-kuy] ‘palm[-tree]’, illustrates a case where a pMa root is compared with the first term of a pMiSo compound.
7The risk of chance similarities is greater for the grammatical etyma, which are by nature short forms, usually involving only one consonant and one vowel, sometimes simply a vowel, and are in general composed of the least marked segments of the phonemic inventory of the language (Campbell1997:219–22 and Campbell and Poser2008:189).
8I have only compared, explicitly, grammatical morphemes that exhibit biconsonantal correspondences.
2.3. The data setsThe data sets thus compiled and tested for regularly recurring correspondences are provided in AppendixesA–C.
Appendix Aconstitutes the primary lexical data set, consisting of the 56 comparanda discussed in4.1.1,4.1.2, and4.1.3below.
Appendix Bconstitutes the secondary lexical data set, made up of 11 comparanda that could be problematic but which are consistent with the sound correspondences from the primary lexical data set.
Appendix Cprovides the grammatical data set, consisting of 12 comparanda, deemed consistent with the consonantal and vocalic correspondences. The primary and secondary lexical data sets were compiled on the basis of three crucial traits: semantic isomorphism, recurrence of biconsonantal correspondences (pMa *C1VC2: pMiSo *C1VC2(V)), and distribution of the comparanda within each of the two language families (pMa, LpMa, CMa; pMiSo, pMi, pSo). The secondary lexical data set, however, contains examples of likely onomatopoeic forms, an example of a pan-Americanism (seeAppendix H, available online only), pMa *ʔuk’‘to drink’: pMiSo *ʔuuʔk‘to drink’, and a few cases that do not exhibit semantic isomorphism but could be cases of plausible semantic shifts.
9The grammatical data set was compiled on the basis of the same criteria, except that of biconsonantal correspondences; only a few of the items in this set abide by that criterion.
Appendix D(available online only) presents 39 forms exhibiting similarities but problematic due to a variety of factors; none of these has been analyzed or discussed in the paper.
10Appendix E(available online only) includes six forms that could be either archaic loans or actual cognates, given their wide distribution within Mayan and Mije-Sokean, and the fact that they have been proposed to be loans in the past; these have also been excluded from analysis.
Appendix F(available online only) consists of the database of 81 potential loans, including 16 proposed for the first time in this paper.
2.4. Proto-Mayan and Proto-Mije-SokeanFor the Mayan languages, I have assumed the phylolinguistic model by Kaufman (1976;1989;1990), shown infigure 1, who proposes a series of bifurcation events, starting around 2500–2200b.c.e.
with the split of Huastecan (Hu) from Proto-Mayan (pMa), leaving Late Proto-Mayan (LpMa) in the homeland; then the split of Yucatecan (Yu) from LPMa, leaving Proto-Central Mayan (pCMa) in the homeland; followed by the split of pCMa into Eastern Mayan (EMa) and Western Mayan (WMa), with EMa subdividing further into Greater Mamean (GM) and Greater K’iche’an (GK’), and WMa into Greater Q’anjob’alan (GQ’) and Greater Tzeltalan (GT). This accounts for the relationship among the six Mayan subgroups that are recognized by most specialists (Hu, Yu, GM, GK’, GQ’, GT).
11Only Mayan etyma reconstructible to pMa, LpMa, or pCMa have been taken into account.
12Fig. 1.

View Large ImageDownload PowerPointFor the Mije-Sokean languages, two sets of recent proposals are available, and they largely agree. Justeson and Kaufman (1993) and Kaufman and Justeson (2004) put forth a model that splits Mije-Sokean into two branches, a Mijean and a Sokean branch. They suggest this split took place by ca. 1000b.c.e.
, according to glottochronological estimates. They further propose that each of the two branches diversified again afterc.e.
500, splitting Mijean into four groups and Sokean into two, according to Justeson and Kaufman (1993), or splitting Mijean into three groups and Sokean into two, according to Kaufman and Justeson (2004). For his part, Wichmann (1995) also splits Mije-Sokean into two branches, Mijean and Sokean, but he then splits Mijean into four groups and Sokean into three. In this paper, what is important is the split of Proto-Mije-Sokean (pMiSo) into Mijean (Mi) and Sokean (So); initially, only pMiSo data were considered, but subsequently data exclusive to pMi or pSo were also taken into account. Moreover, data restricted to pMi or pSo were considered as tentatively representative of pMiSo, especially if they were also present in the newly proposed “Northern Mije-Sokean” (NMS) grouping by Kaufman (2007) and Kaufman and Justeson (2008). NMS could constitute a branch of MiSo distinct from the already established Mijean and Sokean branches, which Kaufman (2007) tentatively classifies together as part of a larger “Southern Mije-Sokean” branch. This model is illustrated infigure 2. Other than serving to reinforce etyma reconstructed in either pMi or pMso, the NMS proposal has had no direct bearing on the procedure followed in this paper.

13Next, I outline the basic phonological traits of pMa and pMiSo relevant to the present comparative exercise.
Fig. 3.
Sound system of Proto-Mayan (pMa). Regarding CVʔV1C, Kaufman (1976:106) reconstructs either *CVVʔC or *CVʔV1C to Proto-Mayan. More recently, Kaufman (2003:508, 1065) reconstructs *CVʔV1C (two possible instances) but no cases of *CVVʔC.
View Large ImageDownload PowerPointFig. 4.
Sound system of Proto-Mije-Sokean.
View Large ImageDownload PowerPointLexical root shapes for pMa are typically *CVC but also *CV.CVC; syllables of at least eight types are defined by Kaufman (1976;1989), but Brown and Wichmann (2004) and Wichmann and Brown (2011) define additional types resulting from their proposal of ten distinct syllable nuclei.
14For pMiSo they can be *CVC, *CVCV, *CVCVC, and a few *CVCVCV. Grammatical morphemes for Mayan are typically *C- and *CV- for prefixes and proclitics, and *-V, *-VC, *-C, *-CVC for suffixes and enclitics, with many of the *-CVC forms analyzable as *-C-VC sequences. For Mije-Soquean, most grammatical morphemes are typically *CV- and *CVC- for prefixes and proclitics, and *-V, *-VC, *-VCC, *-CV, *-CVC, *-CVCV for suffixes and enclitics. Syllable onsets are required, so that a form CVCV(C) is syllabified CV.CV(C).
The consonant inventories of pMiSo and pMa are dramatically different. As far as pMiSo is concerned, there is no glottalized series of consonants, whereas pMa can be defined as containing plain and glottalized stops and affricates, mostly ejectives, but also one implosive.
15Both proto-languages can be reconstructed with the following: *p, *t, *k, *ʔ, *¢, *s, *h, *m, *n, *w, *y. This is identical, of course, to the consonantal inventory of pMiSo. From the outset, it is clear that if pMa and pMiSo are in fact related, it would be likely that pMa would have retained more of the original consonantal distinctions present in the common ancestor than pMiSo. Indeed, pMa can be reconstructed with 26 consonants, pMiSo with only 11, fewer than half those of pMa. This represents a serious problem: it allows for a variety of consonants in pMa to seem comparable to just one or two consonants in pMiSo, increasing the chances of accidental similarities. For this reason, I have only allowed one of the two biconsonantal correspondences in a particular comparandum to exhibit significant phonological distance.
The vowel inventories of pMa and pMiSo exhibit similarities: pMa can be reconstructed with five basic vowels, pMiSo with six; and both can be reconstructed with contrastive vowel length (V:), aspiration (Vh), and glottalization (Vʔ). Thus, there are five or six vocalic qualities and four different levels of vowel complexity.
16Correspondences therefore are complicated, depending on the agreement of multiple factors: height, frontness, length, aspiration, and glottalization. So pMa essentially had 20 distinct vowels, and pMiSo had 24. Add to this the fact that it is very likely that vocalic changes were influenced by adjacent consonants and by vowels in neighboring syllables, as well as the fact that the primary lexical data set is very limited in size. Thus, the identification of patterns and analysis will be difficult. The goal then is merely to point out patterns that seem striking despite the limited sample. It must be recalled that pSo forms would not reflect contrastive vowel length, since pSo lost that distinction, and this must be considered in the analysis.
A specific point must be made. There are two options for analyzing a preconsonantal glottal fricative or a glottal stop following a vowel, i.e., CVhC, CVʔC. One approach is to analyze them as part of a system of complex vocalic nuclei: VV, Vh, Vʔ. Another would be to analyze them as consonants that make up the syllable coda, so that a syllable of the type CVhC has a coda made up of /hC/. In the first case, one is dealing with vocalic correspondences; in the second, with consonantal correspondences. Below I note that of 16 examples of glottal stop in a syllable coda position (either ʔC or Cʔ) in the pMiSo forms, 13 correspond to pMa forms with an ejective stop or affricate, *C’, and only three do not. I chose to analyze those 13 examples as cases of the correspondence of a pMa *C’ to a pMiSo *ʔC or *Cʔ. For example, in pMa *t’ot’‘snail’ and pSo *toʔt‘earthworm’, I have analyzed the postvocalic *ʔof pMiSo as part of the correspondence between pMa *t’and pMiSo *t, i.e., pMa *t’: pMiSo *ʔt. In contrast, the remaining three examples may be examples of the correspondence of pMa *V : pMiSo *Vʔ. A case in point is that of pMa *yuk‘to shake’ and pMiSo *yVʔk‘to move, shake’, where th pMiSo *ʔcan be analyzed as a correspondence pMa *u: pMiSo *Vʔ. Then there is the case of pMa *ʔaʔq’‘vine’ and pMiSo *ʔaaʔ¢‘‘to grow (vine)’ (and pMi *ʔaaʔ¢-a‘vine’), where the pMa *ʔand pMiSo *ʔmatch preconsonantally in syllable coda position and can be analyzed either as part of the pMa *q’: pMiSo *ʔ¢‘correspondence or as part of a complex vowel nucleus pMa *aʔ: pMiSo *aaʔcorrespondence.
Another observation relates to pMiSo *-ks, a consonant cluster reconstructible to pMiSo (Wichmann1995:67). This cluster is uniquely associated with verbal roots in pMiSo in the data sets compiled for this paper, as well as more generally among the reconstructed pMiSo etyma in Wichmann (1995).
17This correlation could provide evidence for the internal reconstruction of a pre- PMiSo *-s‘verbalizer’ with no (obvious) cognate in the corresponding Mayan verb roots.
18The cluster is not isolated: it may be related to the pMiSo *-pscluster, an assumption also made by Wichmann (1995:71); and given that a cluster made up of *tand *s(i.e., *ts) would be indistinguishable from a root-final context of the affricate *¢, it is also possible that some pMiSo verbs ending in *¢could really be roots ending in *tfollowed by *-s, i.e., **CVt-s> *CV¢. Given this correlation, and the absence of an obviously corresponding suffix in pMa, it suggested that pMa verb roots of the form *CVC can be compared to pMiSo verb roots of the form *CVCswith the proviso that the final *sis extraneous to the comparison.
193. LoanwordsAs noted by Campbell and Kaufman (1976;1980;1983), loans between Mayan and Mije-Sokean can be recognized on the basis of linguistic distribution within the respective language families, phonological and phonotactic differences, and morphological analysis. Next I briefly review some of the proposals and approaches;Appendix F(available online only) lists many of the loans proposed in the literature.
3.1. History of loanword identificationKaufman (1964b:131–33) offers the first detailed discussion of loans from Mije-Sokean into Mayan, identified on the basis of their “atypical” Mayan phonological shapes or their irregular correspondences and distribution within Mayan. He adds that some forms common to Mayan and Mije-Sokean bear sufficient similarities to potentially qualify as cognates, rather than loans, including the following etyma: spider, fox1, fox2, good/ripe, fly, incense. Kaufman also argued for several etyma as loans from Mije-Sokean into Mayan: cloud, wasp’s nest, tomato, guayaba, moon, turkey, gourd, boy/son, deaf, older brother, and rabbit. And he observed that at least one of these, wasp’s nest, is found in Mayan with forms suggestive of diffusion and a form suggestive of cognacy, and that two others, moon and boy/son, could potentially be cognates and evidence for Macro-Mayan.
Campbell and Kaufman (1976) followed, discussing the evidence for Mije-Sokean loans not only in Mayan but in other Mesoamerican languages, and arguing for the linguistic affiliation of the Olmecs as Mije-Sokean. They proposed approximately 28 loans from Mije-Sokean into Mayan. Kaufman and Norman (1984) also offered some comments on comparisons of Proto-Ch’olan and Mije-Sokean forms, invoking diffusion for some, but for others simply pointing out similarities. Many of the proposals in Campbell and Kaufman (1976) were revisited by Justeson et al. (1985), who contributed with approximately 22 new proposals, also mostly from Mije-Sokean into the Greater Lowland Mayan languages. Wichmann (1995;1999a) has systematically reviewed the proposals by Cambell and Kaufman (1976) and Justeson et al. (1985), disputing a few of them as loans and proposing revisions in other cases (e.g., regarding the historical stage of some of the proposed Mije- Sokean sources or the direction of diffusion). Brown and Witkowski (1979) have proposed two loanwords involving Mayan and Mije-Sokean languages, one of which I have not been able to confirm. Subsequently, Kaufman (2001–2009;2007) has proposed additional loans from Mije-Sokean into Mayan languages, and Kaufman (2003) and Kaufman and Justeson (2009) also offer remarks on this.
A systematic assessment of proposed loans between Mayan and Mije-Sokean is given inAppendix F(available online only), which includes 16 cases proposed in this paper for the first time. But a more thorough review and discussion is not permissible at this time. I do address a few of the previously proposed loans in4below, as I have reanalyzed a few of them as cognates or have argued that they bear both a loan and a cognate version.
3.2. Sound correspondences among loansTable 1lists the consonantal correspondences present among the proposed loans. The goal is to compare such correspondences to those isolated from the comparanda in the primary lexical data set (Appendix A) and the grammatical data set (Appendix C). In4, I systematically note whether the consonantal correspondences identified among such comparanda match or deviate from those present in the loanword data set.
Loanword Consonantal CorrespondencesThese are not the sound correspondences utilized in the application of the Comparative Method. These are instead meant as controls, to attempt to distinguish correspondences present in loans from those that could be used to identify cognates. Many of the correspondences present in loanwords do occur in the proposed cognates as well. However, some do not. The column headings “Ma” and “MiSo” do not refer to Proto-Mayan and Proto-Mije-Sokean. They simply refer to “any Mayan” and “any Mije-Sokean” language that bears the loans with the correspondences in question. Some of the loan correspondences could be labeled as possible loans due to their narrow distribution in at least one of the language families at the present time. However, it is possible that some such forms could actually be cognates that have been lost from several branches of one of the two language families.
4. Comparison and analysis of sound correspondencesThis section analyzes the sound correspondences between Mayan and Mije-Sokean present in the primary lexical dataset.
Section4.1reviews the consonantal correspondences and4.2the vocalic ones.
4.1. Consonantal correspondencesNext I review and analyze the consonantal correspondences present in the primary lexical data set, as well as a few from the grammatical data set exhibiting biconsonantal correspondences. I begin with the recurring correspondences (4.1.1), followed by several cases of minimally recurring and non-recurring ones (4.1.2), and finally a few unusual ones, recurring or otherwise (4.1.3). Several consonantal correspondences from the secondary lexical data set are addressed, and their agreement with correspondences identified in the primary lexical data set is discussed. Preliminary reconstructions of Proto-Maya-Mijesokean (pMaMiso) consonants are provided for some correspondence sets. Each of the following correspondence sets is also compared to correspondence sets from the loanword data set.
4.1.1. Recurring consonantal correspondencesThis section deals with consonantal correspondence sets recurring at least three times in the primary lexical data set, as well as in biconsonantal correspondences from the grammatical data set.
Table 2provides evidence of recurring correspondence between pMa *pand pMiSo *pwithin the primary lexical data set. Five occurrences are root-initial and two are root-final. Preliminarily, a pMaMiso *pcan be proposed. It must be kept in mind that this correspondence is identical to that of a number of proposed loanwords (seeTable 1, loanword correspondence #1). A form from the secondary lexical data set also attests to this correspondence: B3,paty’‘to smash, crack’ : pSo *pa¢‘to squash’. However, this form is quite possibly onomatopoeic and has not been incorporated into the analysis.
Evidence for pMa *p: pMiSo *p1.
Kaufman (personal communication, 2012) reconstructs pMS *paʔahk‘sweet’.
Table 3provides evidence for the recurring correspondence of pMa *xto pMiSo *h. Two examples are root-initial and one is root-final. A fourth example, A33, is presented, but it is complicated and requires the assumption of a non-comparable segment, the final consonant, *k, in the pMiSo form *pahakor *paʔahk. Preliminarily, pMaMiso *xcan be proposed. Several probable loanwords exhibit this correspondence, nonetheless, calling for caution; see loanword correspondence #36 (Table 1).
20There is a form from the secondary lexical data set, B2, pMa *b’ax‘to nail’ and pMiSo *paahʔ‘to chisel’, that also attests to this correspondence; it is relegated to the secondary lexical data set because it may be onomatopoeic.
Evidence for pMa *x: pMiSo *hTable 4provides evidence for the recurring correspondence of pMa *lto pMiSo *n. Three of the four examples are root-final in Mayan, one is rootmedial in Mayan, and all four of the examples are root-medial in MiSo. Preliminarily, pMaMiso *lcan be reconstructed. Two of the forms in this subset have been involved in loanword proposals: pMiSo *ʔun(ak/eʔ) ‘baby’ has been proposed by Campbell and Kaufman (1976) and others to be the source of WMa+LL#ʔune… ‘child, baby, boy, etc.’ (Kaufman2003:117); and pSo *ʔunu‘atole’ has also been proposed by the same authors to be the source of Mayan *ʔuul‘atole’. In the first case, I believe those authors are correct, but I am proposing instead that pMiSo *ʔun(ak/eʔ) is cognate with pMa *ʔaal‘child of woman’, a different term altogether. In the second case, I am proposing that Mayans would have heard an intervocalic or syllable-final /n/ as [n], not [l], and therefore that the Mayan form *ʔuulis not likely to be a loan but, instead, either a cognate or perhaps even the source of pSo *ʔunu(Mije-Sokeans might have heard invervocalic /l/ as [n]).
21With these two items removed from the loanword data set, then, there remain no cases ofl:ncorrespondences among loanwords; the Mayan loan from pMiSo *ʔun(ak/eʔ) ‘baby’ instead exhibits the correspondencen:n. There are, at present, no syllable- or root-initial cases of pMa *lcorresponding to pMiSo *nor some other pMiSo consonant in the primary lexical data set or the secondary lexical data set for that matter.
22Evidence for pMa *l: pMiSo *nTable 5presents evidence for the correspondence of pMa *mto pMiSo *m. One context is root-initial, another root-final, and a third is ambiguous, requiring that metathesis be assumed for either Mayan or Mije-Sokean. A pMaMiso *mis reconstructed based on this evidence. Several possible loanwords attest to this same correspondence; see loanword correspondence set #21 (Table 1).
Evidence for pMa *m: pMiSo *mTable 6presents evidence for the correspondence of pMa *kto pMiSo *k. Two examples are root-final, one is root-medial. There is at least one more case from the secondary lexical data set, B11, pMa *kox‘cougar’ : pMiSo *kaahaw‘jaguar’. However, this comparison requires the assumption of two unmatched segments in the pMiSo form for which no explanation can be offered. Based on this evidence, pMaMiso *kis proposed. There are many loanwords exhibiting this correspondence, however, so on its own it is not strong evidence; see loanword correspondence #5 (Table 1). At least one of the loanwords with ak:kcorrespondence, F77 (Appendix F[available online only]), Huastecʔokow(ISO code: hus), Tzeltalʔako(ISO code: tzh), Tojolob’alʔako(ISO code: toj) for ‘wasp(’s nest)’, likely borrowed from pSo *ʔokɨwVC, also bears a probable cognate, A50, reconstructible to pCMa as *ʔahqaaŋ, a situation parallel to that already discussed for item A12 (Table 4). The loan shows ak:kcorrespondence, while the proposed cognate shows a *q: *kcorrespondence.
Evidence for pMa *k: pMiSo *kTable 7presents evidence for the correspondence of pMa *k’to pMiSo *k. Three of the four examples are root-initial, one is root-final. Based on the evidence thus far, it is possible to reconstruct pMaMiso *k’. There is an example attesting to this correspondence in the secondary lexical dataset: B1, pMa *ʔuk’‘to drink’ : pMiSo *ʔuuʔk‘to drink’. Both consonantal correspondences in B1, *ʔ: *ʔand *k’: *k, show recurrence. There is also ak’:kcorrespondence in the loanword data; see loanword correspondence #7 (Table 1).
Evidence for pMa *k’: pMiSo *kTable 8provides evidence for the correspondence of pMa *qto pMiSo *k. Three contexts are root-initial, one root-medial, four root-final, and one is ambiguous due to metathesis in either Mayan or Mije-Sokean. The contexts for the *q: *kcorrespondence generally overlap with those for the *k: *kcorrespondence, and thus a distinct proto-sound, pMaMiso *q, can be proposed. Another form, from the secondary lexical data set, exhibits this correspondence: B4, pMa *ʔoʔq‘coyote’ : pMiSo *ʔuku‘dog’.
23However, this form is likely onomatopoeic.
24Loanword correspondence set #8 (Table 1) consists of two cases ofq:kin possible loans. One of these has already been mentioned, loanword F77, due to the fact that it would seem that in addition to a loan, Mayan also bears a cognate to pSo *ʔokɨwVC, seen in A50 of the primary lexical data set, reconstructible to pCMa as *ʔahqaaŋ, a possibility already entertained by Kaufman (1964a:132).
Evidence for pMa *q: pMiSo *k1.
Kaufman (2007) has also suggested the possibility of this cognate set.
Table 9provides evidence for the correspondence of pMa *q’to pMiSo *k. Four contexts are root-initial, four root-final. The contexts for this correspondence also generally overlap with those for the *k’: *kcorrespondence; thus, a distinct pMaMiso *q’is proposed. Loanword correspondence set #9 (Table 1) contains three cases of the correspondence ofq’:k, one of them very likely a case of diffusion from Mayan into Mije-Sokean (F65), another possibly from Mijean into Greater Lowland Mayan (F64), given the distribution of the etymon within each family (but not necessarily the phonology involved), and a third a somewhat questionable case but, if valid, indicative of diffusion from either Huastecan or Eastern Mayan into Mije-Sokean (F72).
Evidence for pMa *q’: pMiSo *kTable 10provides evidence for the correspondence of pMa *rto pMiSo *t. Two contexts are root-initial and two root-final. The pMaMiso sound *ris reconstructed, given that the contexts for this correspondence generally overlap with those for the *t: *tcorrespondence below. This correspondence does not occur in the loanword data set.
Evidence for pMa *rand pMiSo *tTable 11provides evidence for the correspondence of pMa *tto pMiSo *t. Three contexts are root-initial, one root-final. These examples allow for the proposal of pMaMiso *t. Loanword correspondence set #4 (Table 1) is made up of four examples of the correspondencet:t. The case of loanword F41 is important: Justeson et al. (1985:23) and Kaufman (2003:1119) propose that Yucatecan#tu¢is a loan from a MiSo language based on pMiSo *tuu¢=kuy‘palm tree’; at the same time, I propose in this paper that example A25, pMa *tuuk‘coyol’, is cognate with pMiSo *tuu¢=kuy‘palm tree’, at least with the first term of the compound (the second term,=kuy, is simply ‘tree’). Thus, this case parallels those of A12 (Table 4) and A50 (Table 8) already noted above.
Evidence for pMa *t: pMiSo *t1.
Kaufman (2007) has also suggested the possibility of this cognate set.
Tables12and13provide evidence for the correspondence of pMa *ty(’) to pMiSo *t. Although the correspondence *ty: *tdoes not recur at least three times, it parallels that of *ty’: *t, and the two correspondences should be considered in tandem. Also, the fact that all four examples of these two correspondences exhibit the same pMiSo vowel, *ɨ, immediately after a pMiSo *tcorresponding to a pMa *ty(’) is a striking pattern that I do not regard to be the result of chance. The contexts are root-initial only for the *ty: *tcorrespondence, but both root-initial and root-final for the *ty’: *tcorrespondence. There are two instances of possibly related correspondences, *ty: *¢and *ty’:¢, discussed in4.1.2, pertaning to two items in the secondary lexical data set. For now, pMaMiso *tyand *ty’are proposed, rather than a sequence *tɨ, because such an alternative would not explain the various vowels present in the Mayan sets. Also, C6 inTable 11attests to the correspondence *t: *twith the MiSo form exhibiting the vowel *ɨimmediately after *t. Neither of these correspondences (*ty: *t, *ty’: *t) is attested among the possible loanwords. Thus, they could be diagnostic of cognates.
Evidence for pMa *tY: pMiSo *tEvidence for pMa *tY’: pMiSo *tTable 14provides evidence for the correspondence of pMa *wto pMiSo *w. Both contexts are root-initial. Tentatively, a pMaMiso *wcan be proposed. There are two additional items, this time in the secondary lexical data set, that attest to this correspondence: B10, pMa *waʔ‘standing’ : pMi *waʔk‘to step’; B7, pMa *waq’‘to break, smash’ : pMiSo *waʔks‘to smash’; and B8, pMa *winaq‘man, person’ : pMiSo *win‘face, eye’. However, in the first case, the pMi form contains an unmatched segment, the final consonant, *k; in the second case, the forms are likely onomatopoeic; and in the third case, there are two unmatched segments in the Mayan form, although they potentially make up a derivational suffix (i.e., *win.aq; note pCMa *ʔiš.oq‘woman’), and the semantic shift that would need to be invoked is significant. Loanword set #34 (Table 1) attests to the correspondence ofw:wamong possible loans.
Evidence for pMa *w: pMiSo *wTable 15provides evidence for the correspondence of pMa *yto pMiSo *y. Two contexts are root-final, one is root-initial. A pMaMiso *ycan be proposed based on these examples. Several examples in the loanword data set attest to a correspondence ofy:y; see loanword correspondence set #35 (Table 1).
Evidence for pMa *y: pMiSo *yTable 16provides evidence for the correspondence of pMa *wto pMiSo *y. One context is root-initial, one root-medial, and one root-final. All of the pMa cases are adjacent to a low central vowel, either *aor *aa. And all of the pMiSo cases are adjacent to a high vowel, either *uuor *ɨ. In this sense, the *w: *ycorrespondence is in part an overlapping distribution with the *y: *ycorrespondence. However, it seems to be in complementary distribution with the *w: *wcorrespondence. More specifically, then, it can be suggested that the *w: *ycorrespondence be reconstructed as *w; if so, then pre-pMiSo can be suggested to have undergone a conditioned change of *w> *ybefore a high vowel. This correspondence is not attested in the loanword data set (AppendixesAandF[Appendix Favailable online only]), and consequently, it could prove to be very fruitful to seek additional examples in future research.
Evidence for pMa *w: pMISo *yTable 17provides evidence for the correspondence of pMa *hto pMiSo *h. Four contexts are root-initial, one possibly root-medial. A pMaMiso *hcan be proposed. There is one more item with this correspondence, B5, pMa *haʔh‘mosca (fly, insect)’ : pSo *hɨhɨ‘mosca (fly, insect)’, but this item is possibly onomatopoeic. Several instances of the correspondenceh:hare present in loanword correspondence set #39.
Evidence for pMa *h: pMiso *hTable 18provides evidence for the correspondence of pMa *ŋto pMiSo *w. Of the three contexts attested, two of them are root-final and one is possibly root-medial. At this point, a pMaMiso *ŋcan be tentatively reconstructed. There is one potential example of theŋ:wcorrespondence in the loanword data set; see loanword correspondence set #27 (Table 1), loanword F74, with EMa *muuŋ‘cloud, shade/shadow’ and pSo *muŋ‘a person’s shadow’, where final [ŋ] in Sokean is /w/. However, it would appear that some Mayan languages that underwent the shift of *ŋ>nhave borrowed root-final Sokean /w/ (i.e., [ŋ]) as [w] (Kaufman2001–2009:5): Q’eqchi’koyow‘avocado species’ (large) (coyou), borrowed from the Chiapas Soke (ISO codes: zoc, zos, zor) formkoyoŋ‘avocado species’. This loan is also present in Mopan (ISO code: mop) askoyow‘wild avocado’ (Hofling2011:245). Even though at this point this correspondence does not appear to be unique to potential cognates, I suspect it could lead to additional cases of likely cognates, and further cases should be sought out.
Evidence for pMa *ŋ: pMiSo *wTable 19provides evidence for the correspondence of pMa *b’to pMiSo *ʔ. All cases are root-final. At this point, a pMaMiso *b’is proposed and further justified below. Future research may yield more examples of this correspondence. So far, there appear to be no cases of ab’:ʔcorrespondence among possible loanwords and, consequently, this correspondence needs to be pursued further.
Evidence for pMa *b’: pMiSo *ʔTable 20provides evidence for the correspondence of pMa *sto pMiSo *s. All examples are root-initial. One example, A52, is reconstructible to pMa but is attested in only two MiSo languages, one Mijean and one Sokean. Tentatively a pMaMiso *scan be proposed. Loanword correspondence set #10 attests to the correspondence ofs:sin several examples.
Evidence for pMa *s: pMiSo *s1.
See n. 42 inAppendix Afor details about its reconstruction.
Table 21provides evidence for the correspondence of pMa *što pMiSo *s. One example is root-initial, and two are root-final. Since the contexts for the *š: *scorrespondence partly overlap with those for the *s: *scorrespondence, a distinct pMaMiso sound can be reconstructed, tentatively, *š. Loanword correspondence set #14 (Table 1) attests to one instance of a correspondence ofš:s.
Evidence for pMa *š: pMiSo *sTable 22provides evidence for the correspondence of pMa *ʔto pMiSo *ʔ. Six examples are root-initial, and six are root-final. A pMaMiso *ʔcan be reconstructed. Two examples of this correspondence appear in the secondary lexical data set too: #52 and #94. The first is a pan-Americanism and possibly onomatopoeic, the second is possibly onomatopoeic. Loanword correspondence set #42 (Table 1) attests to theʔ:ʔcorrespondence.
Evidence for pMa *ʔ: pMiSo *ʔTable 23summarizes the consonantal correspondences discussed thus far, i.e., those recurring at least three times and not made up of unusual correspondences. I have also included in this section, as already noted, the cases of *ty: *tand *ty’: *t, each of which recurs only twice but which together, all four, exhibit a distinct pattern. Several of these correspondences do not occur among the correspondences present in loanwords (Table 1): 3, 9, 11, 12, 15, 18. I consider these to be particularly important for the case made here: these recurring consonantal correspondences provide evidence for cognacy, and any other correspondences present in the same etyma should be considered to be correspondences that can occur in cognates.
Consonantal Correspondences in Primary Lexical and Grammatical Data Sets11.
These correspondences are discussed in4.1.1in text.
There is a pattern among the consonantal correspondences discussed so far pertaining to the glottalized consonants of Mayan: as indicated inTable 24, seven of the 11 examples of pMa forms with ejectives (*C’) discussed so far correspond to pMiSo *C and a glottal stop in the syllable coda, i.e., pMa *C’VC/*CVC’/*C’1VC’1: pMiSo *CV(V)ʔC or *CV(V)Cʔ. In4.1.2below, additional examples of this pattern are presented. If this correlation were merely accidental, one would also expect to find many cases of pMiSo *CV(V)ʔC or *CV(V)Cʔ that do not correspond to pMa forms with *C’. The majority of Mayan forms in the primary lexical data set, 33 out of 56, lack *C’ (ejectives). Yet there are only three instances of pMiSo *CV(V)ʔC or *CV(V)Cʔ in the primarly lexical dataset that do not correspond to pMa forms with *C’: A23, A43, A53. In the secondary lexical data set, there is an additional example (B10), but there are also two cases of pMa *C’ corresponding to a pMiSo *ʔC (B1, B7), and one case of pMa *C’ corresponding to a pMiSo *C…Cʔ (B2). Viewed differently, of the 16 examples present in the primary lexical data set of pMiSo *CV(V)ʔC or *CV(V)Cʔ roots, only three do not correspond to a pMa form without *C’ (ejective). I suspect this pattern is significant; if one assumes that pMa and pMiSo descend from a common ancestor, a process of ejective fission in pre-pMiSo could be invoked; see4.1.4below.
Cases of Recurring pMa *C’ (Ejective) : pMiSo *C11.
Discussed in4.1.1in text.
One could argue instead for ejective fusion in pre-pMa. But this is not as likely, given the correspondences involving pMa *b’. So far, three examples of the pMa bilabial implosive, *b’, have been discussed. These are all rootfinal, and all correspond to pMiSo *ʔ. There is already a strongly established correspondence of pMa *ʔ: pMiSo *ʔ, recurring nine times in the primary lexical data set alone. If an ancestral language is assumed, one from which pMa inherited *b’and pMiSo inherited *ʔ, there would be no rationale to propose that a pre-pMa language developed *b’out of *ʔ. In fact, the contexts for the root-final correspondences of pMa *b’: pMiSo *ʔand pMa *ʔ: pMiSo *ʔlargely overlap in both proto-languages, as shown inTable 25. Also, the ejective consonants in Mayan seem to correspond to *C…ʔC/*ʔC/*Cʔ or plain *C (≠ *ʔ) in pMiSo; there are no cases of an ejective consonant in a Mayan form corresponding only to pMiSo *ʔ.
25Consequently, it would appear that the distinction between the Mayan ejectives and the Mayan implosive is also paralleled in the corresponding pMiSo forms, at least in final position.
Examples of Overlapping Contexts for Root-Final pMa *b’and pMa *ʔThese correspondences involving Mayan glottalized consonants are discussed in more detail below, where additional data from the secondary lexical data set are reviewed and compared with data from the primary lexical data set.
4.1.2. Minimally recurring and non-recurring consonantal correspondencesThis section reviews several consonantal correspondences based on the primary lexical data set and the grammatical data set that exhibit minimal recurrence or no recurrence.
A root-initial correspondence of pMa *b’to pMiSo *pis shown inTable 26. This correspondence is unique within the primary lexical data set but recurs once in the secondary lexical data set, with an item that may be onomatopoeic, B2, pMa *b’ax‘to nail’ : pMiSo *paahʔ‘to chisel’. The other consonantal correspondence present in A32, pMa *x: pMiSo *h, shows recurrence within the primary lexical data set (seeTable 3); in addition, it is another instance of a pMa *C’VC form corresponding to a pMiSo *CV(V)Cʔ form, where the pMa glottalized consonant is correlated with pMiSo *pand *ʔ(seeTable 24). Also, the correspondences *b’: *pand *b’: *ʔappear to be in complementary distribution, the former root-initially, the latter root-finally. Loanword correspondence set #2 (Table 1) attests to two instances of ab’:pcorrespondence in likely loans, F78 and F81 (Appendix F[available online only]).
Evidence for pMa *b’: pMiSo *pTable 27provides evidence for the correspondence of pMa *ŋto pMiSo *n. This is a unique, root-initial correspondence in the primary lexical data set. However, this correspondence is not unusual, rather it is quite natural; moreover, with its root-initial occurrence, it is in complementary distribution with the root-final correspondence of pMa *ŋto pMiSo *w(Table 18), for which a reconstruction of pMaMiso *ŋwas proposed. The second consonantal correspondence in this item, pMa *-b’: pMiSo *ʔ, is attested in two additional examples, one from the primary lexical data set, another from the grammatical data set, both exhibiting semantic isomorphism. I suspect that it will prove very difficult to find additional correspondences of pMa *ŋto pMiSo *n, due to the simple fact that there exist very few pMa etyma with initial *ŋ: only five cases reconstructed to pMa and two reconstructed to pCMa. Loanword correspondence set #29 (Table 1) attests to a correspondence ofŋ:nin possible loanword F79 (Appendix F[available online only]).
Evidence for pMa *ŋ: pMiSo *nTable 28provides a single set for the correspondence of pMa *nto pMiSo *nfrom the primary lexical data set. The correspondence is attested in C3 and C9 of the grammatical data set, and in B8 of the secondary lexical data set. However, this correspondence is also attested as loanword correspondence #22 (Table 1), in five likely loans (F5, F8, F50, F60, F65).
Evidence for pMa *n: pMiSo *nTables29and30show two sets of correspondences that may be in complementary distribution with that of pMa *l: pMiSo *n, which is characterized by root-final context in pMa but intervocalic contexts in pMiSo. In contrast, the *l: *ycorrespondence is root-final in both pMa and pMiSo, in both cases after back vowels, and the *l: *hcorrespondence is also root-final in both pMa and pMiSo, occurring after a front vowel. Thus it is possible that all three correspondences involving pMa *l, namely, *l: *n, *l: *y, *l: *h, are in complementary distribution. For each of the relevant comparanda, the other consonantal correspondences (e.g., *k’: *k, *w: *w, *h: *h) exhibit recurrence elsewhere in the primary lexical data set.
26These correspondences do not occur among possible or probable loanwords and should therefore be pursued further.
Evidence for pMa *l: pMiSo *yEvidence for pMa *l: pMiSo *hTable 31shows a correspondence of pMa *tto pMiSo *¢; it is root-final, and it is unique so far. However, it is consistent with the context for the correspondence of pMa *ty’: pMiSo *¢in B3, from the secondary lexical data set, as well as A27, from the primary lexical data set, shown inTable 32. In B3, a root-final *ty’in pMa corresponds to a root-final *¢in pSo, following a non-front, low, central vowel, *a. This is also the case for the *t: *¢correspondence: the pMiSo example follows *aʔ. In A27, pMa *paty’‘to smash, crack’ : pSo *pa¢‘to squash’, one finds pMa *ty’corresponding to pMiSo *¢, the latter occurring before a non-front, high, back vowel, *u. Neither of these correspondences occurs among the potential loanwords (Table 1).
Evidence for pMa *t: pMiSo *¢Evidence for pMa *tY’: pMiSo *¢Table 33provides evidence for the correspondence of pMa *t’to pMiSo *t, in two root-initial cases. A tentative reconstruction of pMaMiso *t’is possible. This correspondence does not occur among potential loanwords. It can be predicted that there could be cases of pMa *t’: pMiSo *¢, possibly adjacent to pMiSo *a(a) or a back vowel.
Evidence for pMa *t’: pMiSo *tTables34and35provide evidence for the correspondences of pMa *čto pMiSo *sand *¢, and pMa *č’to pMiSo *s. One case of a similar correspondence, of pMa *čto pMiSo *¢, occurs in the secondary lexical data set with B6, which could be onomatopoeic: pMa *kaač‘horsefly’ : pMiSo *¢a¢i‘horsefly’. Loanword correspondence set #19 (Table 1) attests to six instances of theč:¢correspondence among likely loans, and loanword correspondence set #20 attests to one instance ofč:s. There are no loanword correspondences ofč’:s.
Evidence for pMa *č: pMiSo *s/*¢1.
See n. 37 inAppendix Afor justifcation.
Evidence for pMa *č’: pMiSo *sTables36and37provide evidence for the correspondence of pMa *¢(’) to pMiSo *¢and *s. Loanword correspondence set #15 (Table 1) attests to ten instances of the¢:¢correspondence among likely loans; loanword correspondence set #17 attests to one instance of¢:¢. There are no cases of the correspondence¢’ :sin the loanword data set.
Evidence for pMa *¢: pMiSo *¢Evidence for pMa *¢’: pMiSo *s/*¢4.1.3. Somewhat unusual consonantal correspondences in the primary lexical data setThis section reviews several unusual consonantal correspondences based on the primary lexical data set and the grammatical data set, some of them showing recurrence, others not. A few are deemed unusual because they would require invoking a series of successive changes, possibly in both descendants.
Table 38provides evidence for the correspondence of pMa *kto pMiSo *¢. All the examples shown consist of nouns in both proto-languages. The case of #7 requires the assumption of a intervocalic deletion of **hin pre-pMa, that is, that a pre-pMa form of the shape *kahin, for example, would have undergone assimilation of the vowels, to *kahan, followed by deletion of the intervocalic *h, resulting in *kaan. The same correspondence appears in #96 from the secondary lexical data set: pMa *kaač‘horsefly’ : pMiSo *¢a¢i‘horsefly’. Given the recurrence of this correspondence in three instances, a pMaMiso *kycould be entertained. Loanword correspondence set #6 (Table 1) attests to one case of thek:¢correspondence among likely loans.
Evidence for pMa *k: pMiSo *¢1.
See n. 35 inAppendix Afor comments on the MiSo forms.
Table 39provides evidence for the correspondence of pMa *k’to pMiSo *¢, paralleling the cases inTable 38. There is only one example of this correspondence in the primary lexical data set and an additional one in the secondary lexical data set. However, given its parallel to the *k: *¢correspondence, a pMaMiso *ky’could be entertained. There are no cases of this correspondence in the loanword data set, and thus it could be of utility for identifying cognates.
Evidence for pMa *k’: pMiSo *¢Tables40and41present the evidence for the correspondences of pMa *q(’) to pMiSo *¢and *s. Despite the pattern of recurrence, with three instances of *q: *¢/*s, and three of *q’: *¢/*s, it seems unusual, and at first glance any proposal for cognacy would require a justification involving a significant sequence of intervening sound changes, especially in MiSo, to produce the observed correspondences. I discuss this issue further below. There are no cases of these correspondences in the loanword data set, so they are clearly worth pursuing.
Evidence for pMa *q: pMiSo *¢/*sEvidence for pMa *q’: pMiSo *¢/*sThe correspondences in tables38–41exhibit a similar distribution, in a few cases clearly contrastive, to those of pMa *k(’) : pMiSo *kand pMa *q(’) : pMiSo *k(tables6–9). Thus, there is no evidence that they constitute allosets, and it is preferable to entertain distinct proto-sounds for all four correspondences. It was already suggested that the pMa *k(’) : pMiSo *¢/*scorrespondence be reconstructed as pMaMiso *ky(’). The pMa *q(’) : pMiSo *¢/*scorrespondences could be reconstructed as pMaMiso *kw(’) or less likely as pMaMiso *qw(’) or *qy(’). More data are needed to resolve this issue.
Table 42provides evidence for a correspondence of pMa *rto pMiSo *¢. There would seem to be a pattern of complementary distribution in the pMiSo data between the *r: *¢correspondence and the *r: *tcorrespondence discussed earlier (Table 10), with the *r: *¢characterized by the adjacency to *uand *aain pMiSo; but it is not yet clear whether the data available are sufficient to make this a claim. Interestingly, though, example A15, illustrating the *t: *¢correspondence, shows a similar context, with pMiSo *¢following *a(ʔ) (Table 31). This pattern stands when the contexts for the *t: *tcorrespondence (Table 12) are considered. This supports the suggestion that *r: *tand *r: *¢make up an alloset and that pre-pMiSo *t, from whatever original source (e.g., pMaMiso *t, *r), underwent a change of *t> pMiSo *¢when adjacent to *uand *a(a). Consequently, pMaMiso *rcan be proposed, with a change to *tin pre-pMiSo and subsequent conditioned change to *¢by pMiSo times. There are no cases of this correspondence in the loanword data set, and like the *r: *tcorrespondence, it could be useful to identify new potential cognates.
Evidence for pMa *r: pMiSo *¢Table 43provides examples of three correspondences that exhibit similarities: pMa *x: pMiSo *y, pMa *x: pMiSo *w, and pMa *h: pMiSo *y. Two occur finally, and the third medially, if it is assumed that the *xof pMa *k’axaaŋis comparable to *yin pMiso *¢ay.
27For the moment, the data are too few to proceed further with any confidence, but I suspect these correspondences are in complementary distribution with the *x: *hand *h: *hcorrespondences.
28Evidence for pMa *xand *hand pMiSo *yand *wThree examples, given inTable 44, attest to a correspondence between pMa *ʔand pMiSo *y. The additional consonantal correspondences evident in these cases have already been discussed above: pMa *q’: pMiSo *kand pMa *w: pMiSo *w. In pMa, the *y: *ycorrespondence occurs before and after *u, and after *a; the *ʔ: *ycorrespondence occurs before *aand *eh, and after *i. They share adjacency to *abut in different positions: after in the case of *y: *yand before in the case of *ʔ: *y. The *ʔ: *yand *ʔ: *ʔcorrespondences are in overlapping distribution in pMa. Thus the *y: *yand *ʔ: *ycorrespondences could be in complementary distribution and make up an alloset. In pMiSo, in contrast, the *y: *yand *ʔ: *ycorrespondences are in overlapping distribution; however, both the *y: *yand *ʔ: *ycorrespondences could be in complementary distribution with the *ʔ: *ʔcorrespondence, but it is not yet clear whether this is the case. Thus, tentatively, it can be proposed that pMaMiso *ychanged to pMa *ʔin some contexts (before *aand *eh, and after *i).
Evidence for pMa *ʔand PMISO *yTable 45lists the consonantal correspondences from4.1.2and4.1.3. The following correspondences do not occur among the loanword correspondences (Table 1): #25, #26, #28, #29, #35, #37, #40, #41, #42, #46. Several of these correspondences may be grouped into complementary sets, e.g., #30 and #31, #34 and #35, #38 and #39, and #40 and #41. All the etyma that contain these correspondences also contain correspondences that exhibit recurrence and are more straightforward (see4.1.1).
Consonantal Correspondences with Minimal or No Recurrence or Unusual Correspondences within the Primary Lexical Data Set4.1.4. Further comparisons of pMa *C’Table 26above seemed to indicate a strong relationship between cases of pMa *C’, specifically ejectives, and pMiSo *ʔin syllable coda position, either pre- or postconsonantally (i.e., *ʔC, *Cʔ). Sections4.1.2and4.1.3introduced more cases of pMa *C’ (ejectives) and of pMa *b’(implosive), included inTable 46. Of the 13 examples listed below, six correspond to cases of pMiSo *ʔin syllable coda position. Of the 23 examples of pMa *C’ in the primary lexical data set, 13 correspond to pMiSo *ʔC or *Cʔ.

Kaufman (2003:1362) reconstructs pMiSo *¢ok, while Wichmann (1995:295) reconstructs pMiSo *¢ookʔ.
This may seem like a random pattern. However, only three cases of pMiSo *ʔC or *Cʔdo notcorrespond to pMa *C’, out of 33 comparanda in the primary lexical data set that do not bear a pMa *C’, as already pointed out. If it really were random, one would expect to find more cases of pMiSo *ʔC or *Cʔ that do not correspond to pMa *C’. Again, another way to view this is that out of the 16 forms in the primary lexical data set exhibiting pMiSo roots of the forms *CV(V)ʔC or *CV(V)Cʔ, 13 correspond to roots with pMa *C’ (ejective). This suggests that the correspondence is not random after all. If it were, one would expect it to be distributed more evenly across all cases of pMa *C’, but it is not: of eight cases of pMa *q’, seven correspond to pMiSo *ʔC or *Cʔ in syllable coda.
It was also stated that pMa *b’, the bilabial implosive, patterns both similarly and differently. As already described, three cases of pMa *b’correspond to pMiSo *ʔ in final position. In root-initial position, the primary lexical data set attests to a case of pMa *b’: pMiSo *p; the secondary lexical data set bears an example, B2, of pMa *b’ax‘to nail’ corresponding to pMiSo *paahʔ‘to chisel’, suggesting a correspondence of pMa *b’to pMiSo *p…ʔ, similar to that suggested for A7, A10, A15, A30, A37, and A38. There are two instances of this same correspondence,b’:p…(ʔ), in the loanword data set, with possible loanwords F78 and F81 (Appendix F[available online only]). The secondary lexical data set provides additional examples of pMa *C’ corresponding to pMiSo *ʔC/*Cʔ (or *C…ʔ), including B1 and B7, in addition to the already mentioned B2.
The pattern is not restricted to a single grammatical class.
29In the primary lexical data set, it is attested in the correspondences involving pMa root intransitives (one time), pMa nouns (three times), and pMa root transitives (11 times); it is possible that two of the pMa root transitives may have been positional roots too. And there are additional cases where pMa *C’ (ejective or implosive) corresponds to *ʔC or *Cʔ (or *C … ʔ) in pMiSo, also distributed among several grammatical classes. The three instances of pMiSo *ʔC or *Cʔ (or *C … ʔ)not correspondingto pMa *C’ in the primary lexical data set include two transitive roots (A23, A43) and one noun root (A53); one additional case, although an ambiguous one due to an unmatched segment in pMiSo, is found in the secondary lexical data set, B10, and involves a pMa positional root.
I propose that pMaMiso had *C’ and that pre-pMiSo underwent a process of ejective fission, on the one hand, and implosive debuccalization in root-final position.
30As already stated, of the 16 forms in the primary lexical data set exhibiting pMiSo roots of the forms *CV(V)ʔC or *CV(V)Cʔ, 13 correspond to roots with pMa *C’ (ejective) and only three do not; and of the 23 examples of roots with pMa *C’ (ejective) in the primary lexical data set, 13 correspond to pMiSo *ʔC or *Cʔ. This means that ten correspond to pMiSo *C. A process of ejective fusion, whereby **ʔC or **Cʔ led to *C’, could not account for the cases of pMa *C’ that correspond to pMiSo *C; however, it is possible that a process of ejective fission, whereby **C’ led to pMiSo *ʔC or *Cʔ, could have led to *C through subsequent loss of the glottal stop. Regarding the root-final correspondence of pMa *b’to pMiSo *ʔ, there does not appear to be any obvious reason why an ancestral **ʔwould have led to pMa *b’and not any other glottalized consonant. In contrast, a change of **b’> *ʔ rootfinally, exhibiting debuccalization, seems very natural. The fact that no other glottalized consonant in pMa corresponds directly to a pMiSo *ʔ, only pMa *b’, suggests that such an ancestral language already distinguished between a set of ejectives and an implosive, at least syllable- or root-finally, and at least phonetically. Indeed, the syllable-initial correspondence of *b’: *pappears to fit the pattern of pMa *C’ (ejectives) : pMiSo *C (≠ ʔ) in general, so that perhaps pMaMiso had */p’/ with two realizations: *[p’] syllable-initially, *[b’] syllable-finally. Eventually, pre-pMiSo would have undergone a process of consonant-cluster reduction syllable- and root-initially (if such clusters were even allowed in the ancestral language); this led some of the glottal stops that split up through ejective fission to disappear when such ejectives were syllable- or root-initial, or to become relocated syllable- and root-finally, resulting in “dislocated” glottal stops, specifically those cases where pMa *C’1VC2corresponds to pMiSo *C1VʔC2or *C1VC2ʔ, e.g., A7, pMa *k’uš‘to bite, gnaw’ and pMiSo *kɨɨʔs‘to pull, bite into something tough’.
4.2. Vocalic correspondencesThe following correspondences are present in the primary lexical data set and the items from the grammatical data set with biconsonantal correspondences. I have yet to compare the vocalic correspondences present in the loanword data set to those present among the comparanda analyzed for this paper. My initial impression, however, is that the vocalic correspondences from the loanword data set largely exhibit identity, at least as far as vocalic quality is concerned, differing systematically only in situations where the Mije-Sokean form bears a reflex of pMiSo *ɨ. The cases labeled as either archaic loans or cognates inAppendix E(available online only) also abide by this general pattern. The findings presented below are substantially more tentative than those presented for the consonantal correspondences. A significant increase in the available comparanda will be required to make further progress with the vowel correspondences.
4.2.1. Identity correspondencesI begin with correspondences of identity.
Table 47shows identity correspondences involving pMa *V : pMiSo *V vowels. Parentheses are used to enclose pMiSo glottal stops that can be ascribed in part to correspondences with pMa *C’. Several of these correspondences show recurrence, with the *a: *acorrespondence exhibiting four instances, enough for now to suggest the reconstruction of pMaMiso *a. None of the remaining identity correspondences recurs more than twice.
Identity pMa *V : pMiSo *V CorrespondencesTable 48shows identity correspondences involving *VV : *VV vowels. These are each unique correspondences and thus preclude further analysis.
Identity pMa *VV : pMiSo *VV Correspondences4.2.2. Non-identity correspondencesTable 49shows correspondences of identical vocalic quality but exhibiting differences in vowel length and glottalization. Once again, parentheses are used to enclose pMiSo glottal stops that can be ascribed in part to correspondences with pMa *C’. As noted above, in some cases it is not possible to know the Mije-Sokean form faithfully: since pSo did not preserve vowel length contrasts, forms such as A36 and A42 may not be representative of pMiSo in that regard. Also, there are no cases of recurrence among these correspondences, except perhaps for the *uu: *ucorrespondence, with two examples; however, one of these may not be a perfect match, since it involves a monosyllabic lexeme in Mayan and a disyllabic lexeme in pSo.
Correspondences Differing in Length or GlottalizationTable 50shows non-identical correspondences combining differences in vocalic quality and vowel complexity (length, aspiration, glottalization). Most of these instances involve pMiSo *ɨ. Parentheses are used to enclose pMiSo glottal stops that can be ascribed in part to correspondences with pMa *C’.
Non-Identical CorrespondencesOnly a few of these cases allow for further testing; most do not recur, and some only recur twice or at most three times. For example, based on the cases of *e: *e(A49, C2) and those of *a: *a(A8, A19, A20), shown inTable 51, it would seem that the vowel of C7 underwent change in Mayan: pMaMiso *ewould have shifted to pMa *aafter *h. However, with only one example of the *a: *ecorrespondence, this can only be regarded as speculative. This is the status, then, for the majority of vocalic correspondences: no generalizations can be offered or supported.
Cases of pMa *a: pMiSo *eThe correspondence of pMa *ato pMiSo *ɨrecurs three times, as shown inTable 52. It is compared to that of *a: *a, which also recurs three times. The contexts for *a: *ɨand *a: *aare similar, with some overlaps in both pMa and pMiSo. This supports reconstructing distinct vowels. In the first case, the *a: *ɨcorrespondence, a pMaMiso *ɨcan be proposed; in the second case, pMaMiso *a.
31Cases of pMa *a: pMiSo *ɨ4.2.3. Disyllabic formsThe disyllabic forms inTable 53are important. One form from the secondary lexical data set, B11, has been included. Several of them point to intervocalic deletion of consonants, as well as vowel assimilation between syllables, and call for caution in the analysis of the rest of the data set, where similar processes may not be obvious yet. For example, A5, ‘snake’, could be accounted for as follows: pMaMiso *kyahin> pre-pMa *kahan> pMa *kaan(deletion of intervocalic *h). Similarly, A11, ‘skunk’, could be accounted for as follows: **pahar> pMiSo *paa¢.
Vocalic Correspondences in Disyllabic FormsFurther analysis of the possible scenarios for vowel assimilation between syllables and deletion of intervocalic consonants will likely be instrumental in attaining a clearer picture of the vocalic correspondences, and possibly of stress patterns, not addressed in this paper.
4.2.4. Grammatical class and vowel correspondencesGrammatical class can also be considered. Here it seems two striking patterns emerge with regard to vowel complexity. The first pattern pertains to nouns. For the nouns, the following are the unambiguous correspondences: *V : *V (four times), *V : *VV (three times), *V : *VVʔ (one time), *VV : *V (13 times), *VV : *Vʔ (two times), *VV : *VV (two times), *VV : *VVʔ (one time). Only eight clear examples of pMa *V are attested in the primary lexical data set. The frequency of pMa *VV (18 times) is probably not accidental, nor is its correspondence to only two cases of pMiSo *VV and one of pMiSo *VVʔ; the rest of pMa *VV in nouns correspond to either *V or *Vʔ. In the two cases of the pMa *VV : pMiSo *Vʔ correspondence, the pMiSo *ʔ can be associated with the following consonant (*ʔt, *ʔs), corresponding to pMa *t’and *q’, respectively. In the one case of the pMa *VV : pMiSo *VVʔ correspondence, pMiSo *ʔ can also be associated with a pMa *C’. Thus, for nouns, there are probably 15 cases of pMa *VV : pMiSo *V and three of pMa *VV : pMiSo *VV.
The second striking pattern pertains to transitive roots. The following correspondences are present32: *V : *V (seven times), *V : *Vʔ (five times), *V : *VVʔ (five times). Of the five cases of *V : *Vʔ, four are cases of pMa *C’ corresponding to pMiSo *ʔC. The same is true for four of the five cases of *V : *VVʔ. And last, three of the seven cases of pMa *V : pMiSo *V in transitive roots are cases of pMa *C’. Thus, overall, it would seem that the basic correspondence is between *V : *V (12 times) and *V : *VV (five times) in transitive roots; if the secondary lexical data set is also considered, it would be *V : *V (14 times), *V : *VV (seven times).
Other than these two patterns, there are insufficient data to make further generalizations about grammatical classes, except perhaps that the few adjectives show a great deal of variation.
4.2.5. A case of consonantal influenceAt least one instance of influence of a consonant on a vowel or several different vowels is apparent in the limited data utilized in this paper. Tables12and13provide four examples of the correspondence of pMa *ty(’) to pMiSo *t. All of these cases exhibit the pMiSo vowel *ɨ. It was suggested that this is not likely to be a coincidence. And it was also shown that this *ty(’) : *tcorrespondence does not occur among the loanword correspondences (Table 1). I suspect that at least some vowels of pre-pMiSo became **ɨfollowing **ty(’), after which **ty(’) merged with pMiSo *t.
5. Morphological correspondencesThe grammatical data set consists of 12 comparanda (Appendix C). At this point, only a few remarks can be offered. Most of the grammatical comparanda are short forms, with only one consonantal correspondence; and most of the consonantal correspondences recur in the loanword data set. However, a few do not, which marks them as interesting: the correspondence of pMa *w: pMiSo *yis attested in grammatical sets C4 and C11, and also in the primary lexical data set, but not in the loanword data set. Neither is the correspondence of pMa *b’: pMiSo *ʔ (C10) attested in the loanword data set. Six of the grammatical comparanda bear biconsonantal correspondences (i.e., /CVC/ shapes), which makes them stronger candidates for either cognacy or diffusion (as opposed to chance similarity): C1, C2, C4, C6, C7, C9.
Given the unmarked nature of the consonantal correspondences evident among these comparanda, and given that morphology can be borrowed, it is too premature to venture into the proposal of morphological reconstructions. I offer a few general remarks that point to the need for a broader structural comparison of the languages that is not permissible at this point.
First, based on the work of Kaufman (1989) and Kaufman and Justeson (2004), the following can be said: both pMa and pMiSo can be reconstructed with ergative-absolutive morphology in which ergative pronominal agreement markers coreference the subjects of transitive verbs as well as the possessors of nouns; and absolutive pronominal agreement markers coreference the subjects of intransitive verbs and predicative nouns and adjectives as well as the objects of transitive verbs. However, there is an important difference between them (Kaufman and Justeson2004:1081): in pMiSo the absolutive pronominal agreement marker was used on independent intransitive verbs, whereas dependent intransitive verbs marked agreement with an ergative marker, thus exhibiting a pattern of split ergativity. Nevertheless, given the more general similarity in morphosyntactic structure, it is worth noting that the pMa and pMiSo first-person and third-person ergative markers (#121, #126) bear a resemblance, and that both marked the third-person absolutive with ∅, although this is a common typological trait among ergative-absolutive languages. Kaufman and Justeson (2004:1081) also note that the pMiSo absolutive agreement markers form “the basis of independent non-third-person personal pronouns.” This is true also of pMa, where pMa *haʔ‘demonstrative (pronoun) base’ is followed by the absolutive person agreement marker in order to indicate person and thus produce independent pronouns (Kaufman1989). I propose in fact that pMa *haʔand pMiSo *he(ʔ) are related (C7). A more thorough review of these comparanda, taking into account fully reconstructed paradigms in the respective proto-languages, is necessary before a conclusion can be reached.
6. DiscussionA few remarks are offered next regarding the results and implications of this work.
6.1. Current state of projectThe present project remains incomplete. Additional testing is required, for which a larger database is needed. The 56 comparanda present in the primary lexical data set have allowed for the identification of recurring consonantal correspondences, including in some cases the recognition of conditioning factors, but many correspondences remain minimally attested, some with no recurrence; and given the fact that the vocalic systems of pMa and pMiSo allowed for 20 and 24 distinctions, respectively, once both quality and complexity (length, aspiration, glottalization) are taken into account, a data set of a mere 56 items is simply insufficient.
The paper has followed the strict criteria for the compilation of comparanda put forth by authors such as Campbell and Kaufman (1976), Campbell (1997), and Campbell and Poser (2008). For the comparanda compiled for this study, the most crucial criteria have been the use of forms of wide distribution within each language family, the use of semantically isomorphic forms, and the use of forms exhibiting biconsonantal correspondences. A special effort has been made to differentiate between likely loans and possible cognates through distinct types of sound correspondences. Some of the consonantal correspondences identified in the primary lexical data set do not occur among those identified in the loanword data set; these are particularly suggestive of the nature of the comparanda from the primary lexical data set as cognates and point to their value in the search for additional comparanda. By association, any additional correspondences present in the same etyma can be regarded to be correspondences that can characterize cognates.
Despite this, there is a major problem inherent in comparing Proto-Mayan and Proto-Mije-Sokean: the drastically different sizes of their consonantal inventories. This asymmetry makes it difficult to assess whether certain correspondences are significant: for example, there are four pMa consonants(*k, *k’, *q, *q’) that correspond to a single pMiSo consonant (*k); and in fact, the same pMa consonants also exhibit a correspondence with either pMiSo *¢or *s. To validate these comparisons, one has to be reminded that these correspondences (e.g. of pMa *k/*k’/*q/*q’to pMiSo *k) do not stand in isolation. In the nine instances of the correspondence between pMa *qand pMiSo *k, one finds, beside it, correspondences that also show recurrence within the primary lexical data set in five of those instances: *y: *y, *l: *n, *m: *m, *r: *t, and *t: *t. And in the three instances of the correspondence between pMa *kand pMiSo *¢, a correspondence not attested in the loanword data set, one finds, beside it, correspondences that also show recurrence within the primary lexical data set in two of those instances: *ʔ: *ʔand *t: *t. I have only considered etyma that contained at least one such anchor.
The paper points to the reconstruction of a consonantal system akin to that of Mayan for Proto-Mayan-Mijesokean, particularly in the presence of glottalized stops and affricates, with a series of ejectives and perhaps one (phonetic) implosive. Two distinct patterns have emerged: a correspondence of pMa *C’ ejectives (including initial *p’) to pMiSo *ʔC and *Cʔ clusters, and a correspondence of pMa *b’to pMiSo *ʔin syllable coda. It is suggested that ejective fission in pre-pMiSo accounts for the first correspondence and debuccalization in pre-pMiSo for the second. Either way, a distinct process is required to account for each of these two correspondences, suggesting the ancestral sounds differed, at least phonetically, in a fundamental way, i.e., that one set of sounds was ejective, the other implosive, for otherwise a more similar behavior would be expected. Regarding the pMa *b’- : pMiSo *p- and pMa *-b’: pMiSo *-ʔcorrespondences, perhaps pMaMiso exhibited */p’/, realized as *[p’] syllable-initially and *[b’] syllable-finally.
It is possible to offer a few tentative reconstructions. For example, pCMa *ʔaq’‘to give/place/put’ and pMiSo *yak‘to give’ can be reconstructed as pMaMiso *yaq’‘to give’. Similarly, pMaMiso *q’ɨb’‘hand, arm’ can be proposed. However, it is too premature to attempt to reconstruct most of the items in the primary lexical data set, which I propose to be all cases of cognates. A case like pMa *hil∼ *hihl‘to rest’ may be cognate with pSo *heh‘to rest’, but the only segment that can be reconstructed with any confidence is the initial consonant.
Also, regarding morphological comparanda, a few exhibit biconsonantal correspondences, including some that do not occur in the loanword data set. However, most of the morphological comparanda exhibit short forms, as well as unmarked consonants, which could increase the risk of chance similarities. More morphological comparanda must be sought, and fully reconstructed paradigms must become available in order to proceed further with morphological comparison and reconstruction.
Some etyma offer evidence for both loanwords and cognates; their relationship can be determined semantically, and the distinction between them can be assessed, occasionally at least, on the basis of sound correspondences or, at the very least, on the basis of their distribution within their respective language families. For example, A12, pMa *ʔaal‘child.of.mother’ and pMiSo *ʔun(a/e)(k) ‘child’ (pMi *ʔunak, pSo *ʔune) are proposed in this paper to be cognates, while the pan-Mayan term#ʔune(n) ‘boy, baby’ is considered to be a loanword (F50), as already argued by Campbell and Kaufman (1976:86). It is likely that Mayan speakers would have heard a Mije-Sokean /n/ as [n], rather than [l] (unless [l] was an allophonic variant of /n/ in Mije-Sokean in the past). This is supported by loanwords from Mije-Sokean into Mayan that do have a Mayan /n/ for a Mije-Sokean /n/ (e.g., F5, F8, F60, F65), in addition to F50. Two other cases, A50, for ‘wasp’s nest’, and A25, for ‘coyol’ and ‘palm tree’, have already been discussed. These three etyma provide evidence for both cognacy and later diffusion.
The continuation of this line of research would benefit from a systematic application of internal reconstruction to Proto-Mayan and Proto-Mije-Sokean, focusing on the potential identification of frozen derivational morphology but also on patterns for the derivation of sound-symbolic forms within each language family. With regard to the former, it has been suggested in this paper that Proto-Mije-Sokean final *ksclusters appear to be restricted to verbs and, therefore, that the *sof such clusters could represent a derivational suffix, e.g., a verbalizer. This has implications for comparative work: Mayan verb roots of the shape *CVC should be compared, in general, to Mije-Sokean verb roots of the shapes *CVC and *CVCswithout taking into account the derivational suffix *-s. It is even possible that some pMiSo verbs of the shape *CVCs< *CVC-scould have undergone deletion of the second consonant of the root, resulting in a *CVsshape that shows an unexpected correspondence with a similar Mayan form. In2.2above, it was suggested that this could have happened with pMa *ʔil‘to see’ and pMiSo *ʔis‘to see’.
The study of sound-symbolic forms in Proto-Mayan could yield evidence for the internal reconstruction of the analogical reshaping of roots due to sound-symbolic processes; the same could be done for Proto-Mije-Sokean. The result of such a study could be a means of identifying alternations in consonants or vowels in each language family that are the result of soundsymbolic processes, and this could facilitate the comparison of Mayan and Mije-Sokean forms that are similar but do not exhibit biconsonantal correspondences; a case in point could be D7, pMa *č’ax‘to wash’ and pSo *¢eʔ‘to wash’ (Appendix D[available online only]), where the pMa form could have undergone analogical influence from other forms that end in pMa *xand whose meanings relate to ‘liquid’, such as pMa *ty’ax‘dripping, splattered’ and pMa *t’ux‘to drip; drop’. If such analogical influence did in fact occur, one could then hypothesize a pre-pMa form *č’aʔ‘to wash’, given the regular correspondence of pMa *ʔ to pMiSo *ʔ found elsewhere.
6.2. Other details and related issuesIf Proto-Mayan and Proto-Mije- Sokean do in fact descend from a common ancestor, a substantial amount of time must have transpired to account for the vast differences in their consonantal inventories. Given the glottochronological estimates by Kaufman (1976;2007) for the beginning of the differentiation of Proto-Mayan around 2500–2200b.c.e.
and Proto-Mije-Sokean around 1200b.c.e.
, any hypothetical period of Proto-Mayan-Mijesokean speech would long predate the estimate for the differentiation of Proto-Mayan.
It is also worth considering, given the antiquity that would be required of any Proto-Mayan-Mijesokean language, that the vocabulary claimed to be cognate could be of great importance to understanding Mesoamerican culture history; such a language would have been spoken during the period of the origin and spread of agriculture in the region (see Kaufman and Justeson2009). Indeed, the proposed cognates include terminology of relevance to agriculture and food preparation, and a variety of plants and animals that could offer ecological clues about the homeland of any Proto-Mayan-Mijesokean speakers.
Looking farther afield, some might ask whether the present proposal contradicts the recent work on “Totozoquean” by Brown et al. (2011), which relates the Totonakan language family to the Mije-Sokean (Mixe-Zoquean) language family. In principle, the Proto-Mayan-Mijesokean hypothesis presented here would pose no threat to the Totozoquean hypothesis; in fact, if both were proved correct, then by implication a Proto-Mayan-Totonakan- Mijesokean language would have been discovered! However, it is much too early to begin comparing Mayan, Totonakan, and Mije-Sokean, i.e., to revisit the Macro-Mayan hypothesis.
33First, the present results in support of the Mayan-Mijesokean relationship are only partial and, second, the Totozoquean hypothesis by Brown et al. (2011) has yet to be thoroughly reviewed.
347. Conclusions and future researchThis paper has shown that the Proto-Mayan-Mijesokean hypothesis is plausible and must be investigated further. Regular consonantal correspondences do exist, and suggestions for possible reconstructions and sound changes have been presented. Also, several of the regular sound correspondences are distinct from the correspondences evident in the loanwords that have been put forth to date, including a few loanwords contributed here for the first time. Nevertheless, this study has outlined problems that must be addressed in more detail before a more definitive conclusion can be reached: for example, there are many consonantal and vocalic correspondences that do not exhibit recurrence, and the significant difference in the size of the consonantal inventories of Mayan and Mije-Sokean makes it difficult to assess the validity of certain comparisons. It is certainly possible that many of the proposed cognates isolated in this paper could instead be archaic loans, diffused at a very early stage, between pMa and pMiSo, for example, and which consequently exhibit different patterns of sound correspondences from later loanwords. The isolation of additional comparanda, following strict controls for the evaluation of remote relationships, will be necessary to more adequately analyze the vocalic correspondences and to distinguish between cognates and archaic loans. The existence of etyma that can be traced back both as cognates and as later loans could support the pMaMiso scenario. Future work would benefit from collaborative efforts, the use of electronic databases for both Mayan and Mije-Sokean comparative data, and the detailed contextualization and reconstruction of morphological paradigms, including the application of internal reconstruction to isolate and define frozen grammatical morphemes.
Appendix A Primary Lexical Data SetFor the Mayan reconstructions, I have assumed the work by Kaufman (2003) and for the Mije-Sokean reconstructions, that by Wichmann (1995). However, in a number of instances, I cite additional sources, such as Elson (1992), Kaufman and Justeson (2004), Kaufman (2007), and Kaufman and Justeson (2008). In such cases, or when further explanation is necessary regarding the gloss utilized in the lexical data set, I provide the necessary elaboration in footnotes.
i have concluded that most of the forms in this data set could be cognates, although some could be archaic loans, and a few could be simply accidentally similar. If no asterisk is shown with a cited form, it is reconstructible to either pMa or pMiSo. If the form is reconstructible only to a shallower stage, then such stage is mentioned and an asterisk is used.
Appendix B Secondary Lexical Data SetThese forms are less reliable for initial comparison for three reasons: most are onomatopoeic, some bear unmatched segments, and for some the criterion of semantic isomorphism is not met but a plausible semantic shift can be suggested.
however, given their consistency with sound correspondences proposed on the basis of the primary lexical dataset, i regard several of these as likely cognates too, especially b1, b2, b3, b7.
Appendix C Grammatical Data SetThe grammatical data set bears forms that are largely semantically isomorphic; a few, especially those with CVC shapes, have been used in the analysis of consonantal and vocalic correspondences.
i regard several of these to be likely cognates, some could be loans, and a few could be simply accidentally similar. The data are from Kaufman (1989) and Wichmann (1995), for the most part, with some cases from Kaufman and Justeson (2004). If no asterisk is shown with a cited form, it is reconstructible to either pMa or pMiSo. If the form is reconstructible only to a shallower stage, then the stage is mentioned and an asterisk is used.
Notes1.
I owe a debt of gratitude to Terrence Kaufman and John Justeson, who have read and commented on two previous versions of this manuscript in extensive detail. Thanks are also due to several scholars who offered detailed comments and suggestions: Cecil Brown, Brian Stross, Søren Wichmann, Lyle Campbell, Nicholas Hopkins, and David Beck. Two anonymous referees offered their insights and pointed to errors that required fixing. The present version of the paper has benefited enormously from all of these scholars, as well as Keren Rice. Any remaining errors are entirely my own.

In general, this paper utilizes the spelling system for the names of indigenous languages of Mesoamerica employed by the Project for the Documentation of the Languages of Meso-America (PDLMA), which is in turn based in large part on that used by the Proyecto Lingüístico “Francisco Marroquín” (PLFM) in Guatemala (Kaufman and Justeson2007:193, n. 1). Thus, Mije, Mijean, Soke, Sokean, and Mije-Sokean are used instead of Mixe, Mixean, Zoque, Zoquean, and Mixe-Zoquean, the traditional spellings. For some sounds, the Americanist and Mesoamericanist traditions for phonetic symbols are used, deviating from IPA as follows: <š> for /ʃ/, <č> for /ʧ/, <¢> for /ʦ/, <y> for /j/, <w> for /ʋ/, and <b’> for /ɓ/. Superscripted <y>, as in <ty> or <ty’>, corresponds to superscripted /j/, as in /tj/.

Appendix G(available online only) provides more details of the approaches by Fox (1978) and Brown and Witkowski (1979), as well as the critiques by Campbell and Kaufman (1980;1983).
5.
Brown et al. (2011) argue that Kaufman’s (2007) proposed loans into Totonakan are actually cognates; however, Brown et al. do not demonstrate this, i.e., they do not discuss the evidence for their conclusion, which would require considering distribution of the putative loans within each language family as well as regularity of correspondences within each language family.
6.
Below I explain that some instances of unmatched segments are in fact ignored if and only if there exist, in the remainder of the forms, at least two consonants that are comparable. More specifically, a systematic pattern regarding pMiSo final *Cs clusters is considered below, argued to be indicative of a case of a frozen morpheme analyzed here as pre-pMiSo *-sand, consequently, not a necessary part of a comparison with the Mayan forms.
7.
For some comparanda, it was not possible to determine the morphological composition in detail, and they were excluded from both the data sets; e.g., pMa *šikin‘ear’ and pMiSo *taa¢ɨk‘ear’ contain a sequence that is comparable, PMa *šik- and PMiSo *-¢ɨk, but until it is possible to account for their entire composition in the respective languages, these forms cannot be compared further.
8.
Interestingly, grammatical morphemes are regarded by some authors to be potentially stronger evidence, on their own, of a historical connection of shared descent. Also, grammatical morphemes are more prone to analogical reshaping and phonetic erosion than lexical morphemes.
9.
The forms in the secondary lexical data set are thoroughly consistent with those in the primary lexical data set in terms of their sound correspondences; thus, they should be considered in future research on this subject, but with caution.
10.
The reader may wonder why I have compiled these similar but problematic forms into a separate data set, rather than omitting their mention altogether. I prefer to mention them because some of these are forms that I plan to investigate at a future date or, if I fail to do so, forms that another researcher should look into eventually.
11.
It is also useful to take note of several contact areas within the Mayan region. Justeson et al. (1985) have defined two contact areas and periods: a Greater Lowland Mayan area, involving Ch’olan-Tzeltalan and Yucatecan (prior to, but also subsequent to, the split of Ch’olan-Tzeltalan); and a Lowland Mayan area, involving Ch’olan and Yucatecan (following the split of Ch’olan-Tzeltalan). Kaufman (1976:107;1989:part D, 144–46): the Huehuetenango Sphere (Greater Mamean and Greater Q’anjob’alan except Tojolob’al [ISO code: toj] and Mocho’ [ISO code: mhc]), and the Chiapas Sphere (consisting of Tojolob’al, Tzeltal [ISO code: tzh], Ch’ol [ISO code: ctu]). These contact areas have been taken into account when assessing the evidence from Mayan. Further discussion of their relevance will be provided in a paper I am currently preparing.
12.
Some scholars use a less restrictive approach to assigning etyma to the pMa stage (e.g., Brown and Wichmann2004), and it is likely that such an approach would have yielded more comparanda for comparison with pMiSo.
13.
This paper assumes PMa *ʔand PMiSo *ʔto be phonemes. Kaufman (2003:27) observes that “All [Greater K’iche’an] languages except [Q’eqchi’, ISO code: kek] lack initial glottal stop” but adds that “the [initial] glottal stop appears when an unpossessed noun is not initial in a compound, as 7aj=7iitz, yaj=7anaab’.” He continues by adding that “All other languages, including [Q’eqchi’], have initial glottal stop that does not elide, except after ERGative prefixes” (Kaufman2003:27–28). More explicitly, Kaufman (2003:24) states: “While not contrastive for Greater K’iche’an languages, [initial glottal stop] is contrastive for all other Mayan languages, including Q’eqchi7, and should be written.”14.
I have not dealt with Brown and Wichmann’s (2004) and Wichmann and Brown’s (2011) proposals. First, very few of the 57 Mayan etyma that I propose in this paper to be likely cognates with Mije-Sokean etyma would require revisions based on their proposed syllable nuclei. Second, this paper does not delve deeply into the vocalic correspondences. Third, there are a few issues with those authors’ approach that would need to be addressed comprehensively and systematically before their results could be considered for the present enterprise. For example, their definitional criteria for the Proto-Mayan status of etyma are much more inclusive than mine. Also, they have included etyma that are almost certainly loans from Mije-Sokean, e.g., their Proto-Mayan *kakaw‘cacao’, as well as a number of etyma that were likely diffused between Mayan languages subsequent to their differentiation. Diffusion accounts, in fact, for some of the evidence from individual languages that support those authors’ proposed syllabic nuclei, as well as for data that those authors cannot account for with their model. Thus, a comprehensive review of their data is required, something simply not permissible within the constraints of this paper.
15.
It is also interesting to note that Wichmann (1995:69) speculates on the possibility of the reconstruction of PMiSo *C’, including perhaps “/p’ t’ c’ k’ m’ n’ y’ w’/” (with <c’> represented by <ts’> in this paper), on the basis of one type of environment, the distribution of final *Cʔ clusters in a specific set of canonical forms of verb roots, his type [4], *CVCʔ.
16.
As already noted above, Brown and Wichmann’s (2004) and Wichmann and Brown’s (2011) proposals for Proto-Mayan syllabic nuclei would propose additional vocalic nuclei, namely, *V:h, *V:ʔ, *Vʔh, *V:ʔh, to those assumed in this paper.
17.
I was unable to find evidence to the contrary in Wichmann (1995), although I lack an electronic database based on Wichmann’s reconstructions, so it is possible that I may have missed an example or two of final *ksclusters in non-verbs.
18.
A pre-PMiSo suffix *-s‘verbalizer’ could be comparable to PMa *-isaor *-i-sa‘causative’, but this is only speculative at this point.
19.
It is possible that some cases of pMiSo *CV¢roots that originated as *CVt-shave been compared to pMa *CVC roots, but there is little that can be done about this; at the present, at least, there is no principled way of knowing which pMiSo *CV¢forms might descend from pre-pMiSo *CV¢and which from *CVt-s.
20.
Example F23 from the loanword data set could be a cognate instead: its Mayan distribution could in principle call for a Late Proto-Mayan (LpMa) reconstruction. The problem is that several of those Mayan subgroups (Yucatecan, Ch’olan, Tzeltalan) make up the Greater Lowland Mayan contact sphere. Nevertheless, given the phonetics of the Mayan and Mije-Sokean forms, it seems plausible, as Wichmann (1999:305) suggests, that a Mayan language could have been the donor language, not the recipient language. And if the Mayan form is indeed LpMa in antiquity, it would also be possible for the LpMa and pMi forms to be cognate. Loanword F34 is doubtful, in my opinion, either as a cognate or loan. Loanword F68 could potentially be a cognate; it is present in Yucatecan, Ch’olan, and Mocho’, which could make it a LpMa etymon, but the Yucatecan and Ch’olan distribution could also make it a Lowland Mayan etymon. Loanword F71 is reconstructible with *xon the basis of Q’eqchi’; given the contact between Q’eqchi’ and Yucatecan, it is possible that Q’eqchi’ speakers borrowed from Yucatecans. The case of loanword F75 could be one of diffusion from a Mayan language (Greater K’iche’an) into pOMi.
21.
As one of the referees of this paper pointed out, given that pMiSo had */n/ but not */l/, we cannot know for sure what kind of allophony */n/ might have exhibited. It is possible that it could have had *[l] as an allophone.
22.
There are four instances of an unusual correspondence of pMa *l: pMiSo *mroot-initially, inAppendix D(available online only), which presents lexical items showing similarities but which remain problematic for analysis for several reasons.
23.
See n. 44 inAppendix Bfor elaboration on the gloss provided here.
24.
This is based on my research experience with Isthmus Mixe (ISO code: mir) speakers, who consider the term for ‘dog’,ʔuk, to also be the sound that a dog makes.
25.
Nor is there a good case for a loanword exhibiting this correspondence either.
26.
Elsewhere, pMa *ra(a/ʔ)h‘pain’ and pMiSo *toy-a‘pain’ exhibit a correspondence of pMa *hand pMiSo *yroot-finally in Mayan, root-medially in MiSo, and in the latter, after a back vowel. It is possible that the *l: *yand *l: *hcorrespondences could fit into a broader pattern: perhaps an ancestral **lbecame *nintervocalically, and *hfinally, after which it further changed to *yfollowing back vowels. In the case of pMiSo *toy-a, at first it seems as though the context is intervocalic, but this is the result of a deverbal derivation from the intransitive root *toy‘to burn, hurt’; it seems that the meanings of ‘to burn’ (i.e., quemarse) and ‘to hurt’ (i.e. doler) are evenly split between Mijean and Sokean, respectively. Thus, the basic context is root-final.
27.
This assumption requires that pMa *k’axaaŋbe analyzed as bimorphemic, i.e., *k’ax.aaŋ, in which case *.aaŋwould be a derivational suffix. There is evidence for a pMa *.aaŋ‘nominalizer’ morpheme: pMa *b’ohr.aaŋ, with glosses such as ‘manojo (handful, bunch)’ and ‘rollo (roll)’, is likely derived from pMa *b’or‘enrollar (to roll up)’ (Kaufman2003:914), in part by the addition of *.aaŋ. However, it is not yet clear that this is the best analysis for pMa *k’axaaŋ. This means that this lexical set could be problematic, and hence it has been placed in the secondary lexical data set, as B9.
28.
These forms could be analyzed as follows. The *x: *yand *x: *wcorrespondences could be in complementary distribution with the *x: *hcorrespondence inTable 3, and the *h: *ycorrespondence could be in complementary distribution with the *h: *hcorrespondence inTable 17. A more general process could be entertained: one where **x> pMiSo *hroot-finally (and thus merging with **h> *h), followed by a change of pre-pMiSo **h> *yand **h> *win certain contexts.
29.
Nevertheless, it seems clear that most of the instances of the correspondence in question, at least as far as the primary lexical data set is concerned, occur with transitive roots.
30.
Ejective fission is not a terribly common process, or at least it has not been amply documented. Fallon (1998:423–27) describes only a few examples, but they bear similarities to the process proposed here.
31.
This also suggests that pMaMiso could have had six vowels, given the evidence from tables46and47, but this is only speculation, given that overall the vocalic correspondences are limited.
32.
All pMa cases show *V, as already expected.
33.
Wichmann (1999b) has also proposed a phylolinguistic relationship between Uto-Aztecan and Mije-Sokean. Again, if such relationship were correct, and if my present hypothesis were proved correct after further testing, then Mayan would also be related to Uto-Aztecan. However, to my knowledge, Wichmann’s (1999b) proposal has yet to be thoroughly reviewed and tested.
34.
A very preliminary review of the proposed cognates for the Totozoquean hypothesis reveals some problems: narrow distribution of etyma in at least one of the two language families; unmatched segments without morphological justification; possible loanwords; and semantic leeway. For example, Brown et al. (2011) compare proto-Totonakan *pu’š{ám} ‘twenty’ and Proto-Mije-Sokean *{7ii7}ps‘twenty’, with no justification for the excising of {ám} in the Proto-Totonakan form or {7ii7} in the Proto-Mije-Sokean form. Also, my initial count suggests 22 cases of extremely narrow distribution of etyma in at least one of the two language families.
35.
Kaufman (personal communication, 2012) reconstructs pMi *¢anʔay‘snake’.
36.
Justeson (personal communication, 2011) states that “the only thing relevant to comparison with Mayan is pMi *tuw” and “pMi is something like ‘to stretch something out straight’.”37.
In Kaufman (2003), the cognates for this term can refer to atapesco(camp bed, bed frame) and atlapechtli(see <http://avanthooft.net/vocablos/tl/tlapechtli.html>), which can refer to a variety of frames for different functions (table, altar, bed, tapanco).
38.
Elson (1992:584) and Kaufman (personal communication, 2012) both reconstruct this form as *paʔahkrather than *pahak, as Wichmann (1995:419) does.
39.
Kaufman (2007) reconstructs Proto-Soke *ʔow‘avocado’.
40.
Kaufman (2003:1186) suggests the pMa form is borrowed from pSo *ʔunu. I am assuming that a Mayan speaker would hear an intervocalic [n] as [n], and thus that a loan from pSo *ʔunuwould have come out as *ʔuun(V)(C), not *ʔuul.
41.
The Mayan root *meq’is reconstructed by Kaufman (2003:891) to LL+WMa, i.e., Lowland Mayan (Ch’olan, Yucatecan) and Western Mayan (Greater Tzeltalan, Greater Q’anjob’alan). This distribution could make it a Late Proto-Mayan (LpMa) term. The correspondence of Mayan *q’to pMiSo *ʔkpoints to either cognacy or to early diffusion from Mayan into Mije-Sokean.
42.
Wichmann reconstructs pMiSo *saaka‘white’ in Brown et al. (2010:363), “based on [Totontepec Mije, ISO code: mto]winša:hk‘whitened pupil of the eye due to some injury’ (wi:hn‘eye’), and [Copainalá Zoque, ISO code: zoc]pokasaka‘egg white’ (poka‘egg’).”43.
Kaufman (2007) reconstructs Proto-Sokean *jun-jʉyʉ(i.e., *hun-nɨyɨ) ‘agouti’.
44.
Wichmann (1995:254) reconstructs pMiSo *ʔuku‘cerete/agouti’, while pointing out that pMi can be reconstructed as *ʔuku‘perro /dog’ and, furthermore, that the “Midlands and Lowlands of Oaxaca” developed the meaning ‘coyote’ as a “late derivation.” He also provides only Sokean data for the meaning ‘agouti’. Thus, perhaps ‘agouti’ was not the pMiSo meaning. Another form, pSo *huhnɨyɨ, can be unambiguously glossed as ‘agouti’. Kaufman (2007) reconstructs pMiSo *ʔukuas ‘dog’ and pSo *jun-jʉyʉas ‘agouti’.
45.
My assumption is that the first three segments of the pMa and pMiSo forms are comparable; the final *kof the pMiSo form would be extraneous to the comparison.
46.
Based on Kaufman (1989;2003).
47.
Based on Kaufman and Justeson (2004).
48.
Kaufman (2001–2009:4) states the following regarding these markers: “Whether this similarity is due to diffusion or to genetic relationship cannot be determined at the moment. Mayan *taq is found throughout the family, and Mije-Sokean *tʉk is found in both Mijean and Sokean languages, though not universally in the family; so if it is a loan, Mayan is the source.”49.
Kaufman (1989) reconstructs pMa *-a-b’for root transitives, *-b’for derived transitives, and *-i-b’for intransitives.
50.
Kaufman (1989) reconstructs pMa *-ow∼ *-aw‘antipassivizer of root transitives’ and *-w‘antipassivizer of derived transitives’.
51.
Kaufman and Justeson (2004) reconstruct pSo *-ʔoy‘antipassivizer’.
