AdvertisementPrecision microbiome reconstitution restores bile acid mediated resistance toClostridium difficileNaturevolume517,pages205–208 (2015)Cite this article46kAccesses988Citations210AltmetricMetricsdetailsSubjectsThis article has beenupdatedAbstractThe gastrointestinal tracts of mammals are colonized by hundreds of microbial species that contribute to health, including colonization resistance against intestinal pathogens1. Many antibiotics destroy intestinal microbial communities and increase susceptibility to intestinal pathogens2. Among these,Clostridium difficile, a major cause of antibiotic-induced diarrhoea, greatly increases morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients3. Which intestinal bacteria provide resistance toC. difficileinfection and theirin vivoinhibitory mechanisms remain unclear. Here we correlate loss of specific bacterial taxa with development of infection, by treating mice with different antibiotics that result in distinct microbiota changes and lead to varied susceptibility toC. difficile. Mathematical modelling augmented by analyses of the microbiota of hospitalized patients identifies resistance-associated bacteria common to mice and humans. Using these platforms, we determine thatClostridium scindens, a bile acid 7α-dehydroxylating intestinal bacterium, is associated with resistance toC. difficileinfection and, upon administration, enhances resistance to infection in a secondary bile acid dependent fashion. Using a workflow involving mouse models, clinical studies, metagenomic analyses, and mathematical modelling, we identify a probiotic candidate that corrects a clinically relevant microbiome deficiency. These findings have implications for the rational design of targeted antimicrobials as well as microbiome-based diagnostics and therapeutics for individuals at risk ofC. difficileinfection.

MainInfection withC. difficileis a growing public health threat3. Susceptibility to infection is associated with antibiotic use3, and faecal microbiota transplant, which restores microbiota complexity, can resolve recurrent infections4. However, the microbiome-encoded genes and biosynthetic gene clusters5critical for infection resistance remain largely undefined, limiting mechanistic understanding and development of microbiota-based therapies. We sought to identify, interrogate, and validate sources of microbiome-mediatedC. difficileresistance. We first investigated the impact of antibiotics with diverse antimicrobial spectra on the intestinal microbiota andC. difficilesusceptibility (Extended Data Fig. 1a). Consistent with prior work from our group2, administration of clindamycin resulted in long-lasting susceptibility to infection (Fig. 1a). In contrast, ampicillin induced transient susceptibility (Fig. 1c), whereas enrofloxacin did not increase susceptibility toC. difficileinfection (Fig. 1e).
C. difficiletoxin expression correlated significantly withC. difficileabundance in the intestine (Extended Data Fig. 1b). The antibiotic regimens did not substantially alter bacterial density (Extended Data Fig. 1c), but 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene amplicon sequencing revealed that the three antibiotics had distinct impacts on intestinal microbiota composition (Fig. 1b, d, f).

PowerPoint slideWe exploited this variance in intestinal bacterial composition and infection susceptibility to relate features of microbiota structure toC. difficileinhibition. Infection susceptibility correlated with decreased microbiota alpha diversity (that is, diversity within individuals) (Fig. 2a), consistent with previous studies6. Using weighted UniFrac7distances to evaluate beta diversity (that is, diversity between individuals), we found that although clindamycin and ampicillin administration induced distinct changes in microbiota structure, recovery of resistance corresponded with return to a common coordinate space shared by antibiotic-naive animals (Fig. 2b). However, these diversity metrics generally did not resolve the susceptibility status of animals harbouring microbiota with low alpha diversity (Fig. 2a(red box)) or at early time points after antibiotic exposure (Fig. 2b), suggesting that recovery of more precise microbiota features (for example, individual species) contributed to infection resistance. We correlated resistance with individual bacterial species abundances, corresponding to operational taxonomic units (OTUs, ≥97% 16S sequence similarity) (Extended Data Fig. 1d), and identified 11 bacterial OTUs that correlated strongly with infection resistance (Fig. 2c). These OTUs represented a small fraction of the microbiota membership (6%) and comprised primarilyClostridiumcluster XIVa, including the OTU with the strongest resistance correlation, even among animals harbouring low alpha-diversity microbiota,C. scindens(Fig. 2c).

PowerPoint slideTo relate intestinal bacterial species toC. difficileresistance in humans, we extended our study to a cohort of patients undergoing allogeneic haematopoeietic stem-cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). The majority of these patients were diagnosed with a haematological malignancy and received chemotherapy and/or total body irradiation as well as antibiotics during transplantation (Extended Data Table 1), incurring reduced microbiota biodiversity associated with increased risk of bacterial blood stream infections8andC. difficileinfection9. Compared with controlled animal studies, temporal variation in antibiotic administration and sampling times among patients complicates analysis of relationships between microbiota composition and infection susceptibility. To address these challenges, we employed a recently developed systems biology approach10that integrates antibiotic delivery schedules and time-resolved microbiota data to model mathematically the microbiota dynamics and infer which bacteria inhibitC. difficile.
We included 24 allo-HSCT patients: 12 diagnosed withC. difficileinfection and 12 who wereC. difficilecarriers without clinical infection (Fig. 2dandExtended Data Fig. 2). To facilitate comparisons across data sets, we clustered murine and human microbiota together to define OTUs that together accounted for a majority of both the human and mouse microbiota structure (Extended Data Fig. 3a–c), and applied the modelling approach to the murine study in parallel. We compared the normalized interaction networks from the human (Extended Data Fig. 3d) and the murine models (Extended Data Fig. 3e) and identified bacteria displaying strong inhibition againstC. difficile. Despite some differences across host species networks, the human model identified twoC. difficile-inhibiting OTUs that were conserved in the murine model (Fig. 2e, f), the strongest of which wasC. scindens, corroborating our murine correlation-based analyses (Fig. 2c).
To evaluate causality between intestinal bacteria identified in our analyses and infection resistance, we adoptively transferred resistance-associated bacteria. We cultured a representative consortium of four intestinal bacterial isolates with species-level 16S similarity to OTUs associated withC. difficileinhibition in our mouse and human analyses (Extended Data Fig. 4) and, after antibiotic administration, animals (n= 10) were administered a suspension containing the four-bacteria consortium or vehicle (phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)) beforeC. difficileinfection. Additionally, sinceC. scindenshad the strongest resistance associations in mice and humans (Fig. 2c, e), we included this bacterium in the consortium and in a third arm alone. Adoptive transfer of the consortium orC. scindensalone amelioratedC. difficileinfection (Fig. 3a, bandExtended Data Fig. 5a) as well as associated weight loss (Fig. 3candExtended Data Fig. 5b) and mortality (Fig. 3d) significantly compared with control. Transfer of the other three isolates individually, however, did not significantly enhance infection resistance (Extended Data Fig. 5c). Engraftment of the transferred bacteria was confirmed (Extended Data Fig. 5d) by 16S sequence comparison with the input and the native intestinal bacteria from our initial analyses (Fig. 2), thus fulfilling Koch’s postulates (albeit for a microorganism and a beneficial health outcome). The abundance ofC. scindenscorrelated significantly with infection resistance (Fig. 3e), suggesting that improving bacterial engraftment efficiency may enhance the protective effects of the adoptive transfer. Importantly, bacteria transfer was precise and engraftment did not alter other aspects of microbiota structure compared with control, including density (Extended Data Fig. 5e) and biodiversity (Fig. 3f).

PowerPoint slideWe next interrogated the mechanism ofC. scindens-mediatedC. difficileinhibition. Some secondary bile acids can impairC. difficilegrowthin vitro11,12, but the source and contribution of such metabolites to infection resistancein vivoremain unclear. Noting thatC. scindensexpresses enzymes crucial for secondary bile acid synthesis13that are uncommon among intestinal bacteria14, we hypothesized that theC. difficile-protective effects ofC. scindensmay derive from this rare biosynthetic capacity. Analyses of antibiotic-exposed animals (Figs 1and2) revealed that recovery of secondary bile acids and the abundance of the gene family responsible for secondary bile acid biosynthesis (as predicted using PICRUSt15) correlated withC. difficileresistance (Fig. 4a, b). Targeted microbiome analysis of the gene family responsible for secondary bile acid biosynthesis indicated that abundance of the bile acid inducible (bai) operon genes correlated strongly with resistance toC. difficileinfection (Fig. 4c) but that bile salt hydrolase (BSH)-encoding gene abundance did not. These results are consistent with reports indicating that BSH-encoding genes are distributed broadly while an extremely small fraction of intestinal bacteria possess a complete secondary bile acid synthesis pathway14. PCR-based assay ofbaiCD, which encodes the 7α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase enzyme critical for secondary bile acid biosynthesis, revealed that animals that had recoveredC. difficileresistance after antibiotic exposure harboured abaiCD+microbiome, whereas susceptible animals did not (Extended Data Fig. 6a).

PowerPoint slideRecipients of either the consortium orC. scindensharbouredbaiCD+microbiomes with restored abundance of secondary bile acid biosynthesis genes (predicted by PICRUSt) (Extended Data Fig. 6b). Administration of either bacterial suspension also restored relative abundance of the secondary bile acids deoxycholate (DCA) (Fig. 4d) and lithocholate (LCA) (Extended Data Fig. 7a), both of which inhibitC. difficilein a dose-dependent fashion (Extended Data Fig. 8a, b), but abundances of primary bile acids were not significantly altered (Extended Data Fig. 7). Metagenomic inference indicated that consortia recipients harboured microbiomes with greater abundances of secondary bile acid biosynthesis genes thanC. scindensrecipients (Extended Data Fig. 6b), perhaps explaining their superior resistance toC. difficile. However, intestinal abundances of DCA and LCA were each comparable in the consortia andC. scindensrecipients pre-infection challenge (Fig. 4dandExtended Data Fig. 7a), suggesting additional mechanisms enhanced colonization resistance in consortia recipients. Indeed, of the four transferred bacteria, onlyC. scindenswasbaiCD+(Extended Data Fig. 6a). Engraftment ofC. scindensalso correlated strongly with DCA relative abundance andbaiCDin recipients, reaching levels observed in antibiotic-naive animals (Fig. 4e), which indicated that precise transfer and efficient engraftment of this bacterium could restore physiological levels of secondary bile acid synthesis in antibiotic-exposed animals.
We evaluated bile acid dependent microbiota-mediated inhibition ofC. difficileusing anex vivomodel. Pre-incubation of intestinal content from antibiotic-naive animals with cholestyramine, a bile acid sequestrant16, permittedC. difficilegrowth (Extended Data Fig. 8c, d) comparable to intestinal content from antibiotic-exposed animals. Consistent within vivofindings, introduction ofC. scindenssignificantly inhibitedC. difficilein the intestinal content from antibiotic-exposed animals. This effect was neutralized when intestinal content was pre-incubated with cholestyramine (Fig. 4f), indicating thatC. scindens-mediated inhibition ofC. difficileis dependent upon accessing and modifying endogenous bile salts and recapitulates a natural mechanism of microbiota-mediated infection resistance.
In summary, we show that a fraction of the intestinal microbiota as precise as a single bacterial species confers infection resistance by synthesizingC. difficile-inhibiting metabolites from host-derived bile salts. Our use of a human-derivedC. scindensisolate to augment murineC. difficileinhibition emphasizes the conservation of this finding across species and suggests therapeutic and diagnostic applications. The genusClostridiumis phylogenetically complex17,18, highlighting the value of integrating functional genomic and metabolomic interrogation with 16S rRNA profiling when evaluating probiotic candidates. Most bile-acid 7-dehydroxylating bacteria are cluster XIVa Clostridia closely related to one another14,19,20and resistance-associated OTUs we identified, suggesting thatbaior 16S gene signatures may serve as specific, functionally meaningful biomarkers for infection resistance. The replenishment of secondary bile acids and/or biosynthesis-competent bacteria (such asC. scindens) may contribute to the therapeutic efficacy of faecal microbiota transplant21. Attempts to manipulate intestinal bile acids directly should be performed with caution since some secondary bile acids have been linked to gastrointestinal cancers22. Other bacteria may augment resistance by enhancing 7-dehydroxylating Clostridia or through additional orthogonal mechanisms, such as competition for mucosal carbohydrates23, activation of host immune defences24,25, or production of antibacterial peptides26. Knowledge of such mechanisms and the ecological context of those microbes responsible will facilitate amplification of microbiota-mediated pathogen resistance in individuals at risk of infection.
MethodsMouse husbandryAll experiments were performed with C57BL/6J female mice, 6–8 weeks old, purchased from Jackson Laboratories and housed in sterile cages with irradiated food and acidified water. Mouse handling and weekly cage changes were performed by investigators wearing sterile gowns, masks, and gloves in a sterile biosafety hood. All animals were maintained in a specific-pathogen-free facility at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center Animal Resource Center. After co-housing for at least 2 weeks, animals (individuals or colonies, as indicated per experiment) were separately housed and randomly assigned to experimental groups. For experiments involvingC. difficileinfection, mice were administered 1,000C. difficileVPI 10463 spores in PBS by oral gavage. All animal experiments were performed at least twice unless otherwise noted. Experiments were performed in compliance with Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center institutional guidelines and approved by the institution’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
MurineC. difficilesusceptibility time-course experimentsMice from three separately housed colonies were kept in the same facility and administered clindamycin (administered by intraperitoneal injection, 200 µg daily), ampicillin (administered in drinking water, 0.1 g l−1), or enrofloxacin (administered in drinking water, 0.4 g l−1) for 3 days (days −2 to 0). At each time point after antibiotic cessation (days 1, 6, 10, 14, and 21), one mouse from each of the three colonies was randomly selected to be single-housed, infected withC. difficile, and analysed, yielding triplicate biological measurements per group, per time point. Intestinal content (faeces) was sampled before infection challenge for multiparallel 16S amplicon sequencing and microbiota structure analysis.
C. difficilesusceptibility was determined by selective culture and enumeration of c.f.u. from intestinal content (caecum and colon) 24 h after challenge.
Murinein vivoadoptive transfer experimentsSix colonies of mice (n= 30 total) were administered antibiotics as described previously27and subsequently individually housed and assigned randomly to one of three groups. Two days after antibiotics, groups of individually housed mice (n= 10 per group) received either 1,000,000 c.f.u. of a four-bacteria suspension (containing equal numbers ofC. scindens(ATCC35704),Barnesiella intestihominis(isolated from murine faeces in-house),Pseudoflavonifractor capillosus(ATCC29799), andBlautia hansenii(ATCC27752)), a suspension containing 1,000,000C. scindens, or vehicle (PBS) by gavage. All bacteria were grown under anaerobic conditions in reduced brain–heart infusion media supplemented with yeast extract and cysteine except forB. intestihominis, which was grown in liquid Wilkins–Chalgren media, and re-suspended in anaerobic PBS before administration to animals. Adoptive transfers of the suspensions were performed once daily for 2 consecutive days before challenge withC. difficileVPI 10463 (1,000 spores in PBS).
C. difficilebacteria and cytotoxin were quantified in faecal samples obtained from mice 24 h after infection challenge. Animals were monitored for 21 days after infection challenge and weight loss was recorded.
Murineex vivoadoptive transfer experimentsThree individually housed mice were administered 200 µg of clindamycin by intraperitoneal injection and killed 24 h later. Intestinal content was harvested from the ilea of killed animals, immediately transferred to an anaerobic chamber, and re-suspended in anaerobic PBS. Fractions containing 100 mg of intestinal content from each mouse were distributed and received eitherC. scindens(100,000 c.f.u.) or vehicle (anaerobic PBS). A third fraction was pre-treated with cholestyramine (1.5 mg) before receivingC. scindens. After transfer, the each suspension was inoculated with vegetativeC. difficile(200 c.f.u.), incubated at 37 °C for 60 h, andC. difficilebacteria were quantified by overnight culture on selective media.
QuantitativeC. difficileculture and toxin A and BThe quantities ofC. difficilec.f.u. and cytotoxin in the intestinal (caecal) contents of animals were determined as described previously2.
Enzymatic assay of secondary bile acid abundanceThe relative abundances of primary and secondary bile acids in the intestinal content of killed animals was quantified using an enzymatic assay as described previously28.
Sample collection and DNA extractionIntestinal microbiota content samples were obtained, snap-frozen, stored, and DNA extracted as described previously29. Briefly, a frozen aliquot (∼100 mg) of each sample was suspended, while frozen, in a solution containing 500 µl of extraction buffer (200 mM Tris, pH 8.0/200 mM NaCl/20 mM EDTA), 200 µl of 20% SDS, 500 µl of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24:24:1), and 500 µl of 0.1-mm diameter zirconia/silica beads (BioSpec Products). Microbial cells were lysed by mechanical disruption with a bead beater (BioSpec Products) for 2 min, after which two rounds of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol extraction were performed. DNA was precipitated with ethanol and re-suspended in 50 μl of TE buffer with 100 μg ml−1RNase. The isolated DNA was subjected to additional purification with QIAamp Mini Spin Columns (Qiagen). Specimen collection from patients and analysis of the biospecimen group was approved by the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center Institutional Review Board. All participants provided written consent for specimen collection and analysis.
Quantification 16S copy number density by rtPCRDNA extracted from intestinal content samples (faeces) was subjected to rtPCR of 16S rRNA using 0.2 µM concentrations of the broad-range bacterial 16S primers 517F (5′-GCCAGCAGCCGCGGTAA-3′) and 798R (5′-AGGGTATCTAATCCT-3′) and the DyNAmo SYBR green rtPCR kit (Finnzymes). Standard curves were generated by serial dilution of the PCR blunt vector (Invitrogen) containing one copy of the 16S rRNA gene derived from a member of the Porphyromonadaceae family. The cycling conditions were as follows: 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 52 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min.
Quantification ofbaiCDby PCRDNA extracted from intestinal content samples (faeces) was subjected to PCR-based detection of the 7α-HSDH-encodingbaiCDgene as described previously30.
16S rRNA gene amplification and multiparallel sequencingAmplicons of the V4-V5 16S rRNA region were amplified and sequenced using an Illumina MiSeq platform for samples in thein vivoandex vivoadoptive transfer experiments. For each sample, duplicate 50-μl PCR reactions were performed, each containing 50 ng of purified DNA, 0.2 mM dNTPs, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1.25 U Platinum Taq DNA polymerase, 2.5 μl of 10× PCR buffer, and 0.2 μM of each primer designed to amplify the V4-V5: 563F (5′-nnnnnnnn-NNNNNNNNNNNN-AYTGGGYDTAAAGNG-3′) and 926R (5′- nnnnnnnn-NNNNNNNNNNNN-CCGTCAATTYHTTTRAGT-3′). A unique 12-base Golay barcode (Ns) preceded the primers for sample identification31, and one to eight additional nucleotides were placed in front of the barcode to offset the sequencing of the primers. Cycling conditions were 94 °C for 3 min, followed by 27 cycles of 94 °C for 50 s, 51 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min. A condition of 72 °C for 5 min was used for the final elongation step. Replicate PCRs were pooled, and amplicons were purified using the Qiaquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen). PCR products were quantified and pooled at equimolar amounts before Illumina barcodes and adaptors were ligated on using the Illumina TruSeq Sample Preparation protocol. The completed library was sequenced on an Ilumina Miseq platform following the Illumina recommended procedures. Samples in the murine and humanC. difficilesusceptibility time-course experiments were sequenced using the 454 FLX Titanium platform as described previously32. Sequences from allo-HSCT patients were obtained from a previously published study8.
Sequence analysisSequences were analysed using the mothur33(version 1.33.3) pipeline. Potentially chimaeric sequences were removed using the UChime algorithm34. Sequences with a distance-based similarity of 97% or greater were grouped into OTUs using the average neighbour algorithm and classified using the BLAST (megablast) algorithm and the GenBank 16S rRNA reference database; OTU-based microbial diversity was estimated by calculating the Shannon diversity index. Sequence abundance profiles in each sample were used for downstream statistical and modelling analysis. A phylogenetic tree was inferred using Clearcut35, on the 16 s rRNA sequence alignment generated by mothur; unweighted UniFrac7was run using the resulting tree, and principal coordinate analysis was performed on the resulting matrix of distances between each pair of samples. PICRUSt (version 0.9.1)15in combination with QIIME (version 1.6.0)36was used to predict abundances of the gene family responsible for secondary bile acid biosynthesis (KEGG pathway ko00121) for a set of 83 samples. Maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees (Kimura model, bootstrap of 100 replicates) were constructed using the MEGA 6.06 package from representative sequences of intestinal bacteria as described37. Raw sequence data from metagenomic shotgun sequencing of six intestinal (ileal) microbiome samples were pre-processed to remove mouse-derived, duplicate, and low-quality reads as well as low-quality bases in accordance with Human Microbiome Project protocols38The remaining reads were mapped against a set of proteins associated with the secondary bile acid biosynthesis pathway using RAPSearch version 2.07 (ref.
39). For the subsequent analysis, only hits with anEvalue ≤ 0.1, a minimum alignment length of 30, and a minimum similarity of 50% were considered.
Quantification of secondary bile acid speciesSamples of murine intestinal content (faeces,∼30 mg) were homogenized using a handheld homogenizer (Omni International) in 80% aqueous methanol and corrected to a final concentration of 0.5 mg per 10 µl. Samples were then sonicated using a Diagenode sonicator at high power, 6 × 30 s cycles. Four hundred microlitres of this material were removed and 20 µl of internal standard added (25 µM d4-chenodeoxycholic acid in 55%/45% methanol/water (v/v)). A further 1 ml methanol was added to the extract and samples were vortexed at 1,400 r.p.m. for 1 h at 30 °C (Thermomixer, Eppendorf). Remaining solid material was removed by centrifugation (21,000gfor 10 min) and the supernatant transferred to a glass tube. A second extraction was performed using 1.5 ml methanol, and combined supernatants were dried under a nitrogen gas stream. Finally samples were re-suspended in 300 µl 55%/45% methanol/water (v/v), filtered through a 3 kDa molecular weight cut-off cartridge (Millipore), and transferred to a mass spectrometry vial containing a reduced volume glass insert. Bile acids were separated using an Agilent 1290 HPLC and Cogent C18 column (2.1 mm × 150 mm, 2.2 µm; MicroSolv Technology). Mobile phase A: water + 0.05% formic acid; mobile phase B: acetone + 0.05% formic acid; flow rate 0.35 ml min−1. Injection volume was 5 μl and the liquid chromatography gradient was from 25% B to 70% B in 25 min. Bile acids were detected using an Agilent 6550 Q-TOF mass spectrometer with JetStream source, operating in negative ionization mode and extended dynamic range. Acquisition was fromm/z: 50–1,100 at one spectrum per second; gas temperature: 275 °C; drying gas: 11 l min−1; nebulizer: 30 psig; sheath gas: 325 °C; sheath gas flow 10 l min−1;VCap4000 V; fragmentor 365 V and Oct 1 RF 750 V. Bile acids (Extended Data Table 2) were identified by their exact mass and confirmed by chromatographic alignment to authentic standards (purchased from Steraloids or Sigma Aldrich). Abundances of the M-H and M+formate ions were then extracted and summed using ProFinder software (Agilent Technologies) and normalized to the internal standard abundance using Mass Profiler Professional software (Agilent Technologies).
DCA and LCAC. difficileinhibition assaysGrowth ofC. difficilein brain–heart infusion liquid media supplemented with yeast extract and cysteine, with added DCA (0.1%, 0.01%, 0.001%, final concentration, in water vehicle) or LCA (0.01%, 0.001%, final concentration, in 100% ethanol vehicle), or vehicle alone was monitored by attenuance (D600 nm) using a spectrophotometer.
StatisticsStatistical analyses were performed using the R (v. 3.0.2) and GraphPad Prism (version 6.0c) software packages. The Mann–Whitney rank sum test (two-tailed) was used for comparisons of continuous variables between two groups with similar variances; the Kruskal–Wallis test with Dunn correction for multiple comparisons was used for comparisons of three groups or more (n≥ 5 samples per group) with similar variances. In all experiments involving group comparisons, at least six animals were used per group; for these non-parametric tests, it was calculated that a sample size of six per group would be sufficient to detect an effect size of 2 with 90% power (α= 0.05)40. Data were visualized using bar plots with centre values representing the mean and error bars representing standard error of the mean, and box plots representing the median and interquartile range of the upper and lower quartiles and error bars showing the range. Spearman rank correlation tests (two-tailed) were used to find significant correlations between two continuous variables. After statistical analyses with multiple comparisons, we used the Benjamini–Hochberg method to control the false discovery rate. The log-rank test was used to find significant differences in the survival distributions amongC. difficile-challenged groups of animals. When possible, investigators were blinded during group allocation and outcome assessment (16S and metagenomic shotgun sequence collection, extraction, quantification, and analysis; microbiota time-series inference modelling; quantification of bile species by enzymatic assay and high-performance liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry; enumeration ofC. difficilein animal experiments).
Inference modelling of mouse microbiota time-seriesTo determine the network of bacterial–bacterial interactions and extract native resident bacteria withC. difficileinhibitory properties, we applied the Lotka–Volterra dynamics-based framework of ref.
10to the mouse data set. This inference framework consists of a regularized least-square regression of the observed data points and the known antibiotic signal against the difference of the log-transformed total abundances in time:withi= 1 …N, whereNis the total number of considered OTUs. This results in coefficients characterizing growth, directed interactions, and susceptibilities of each OTU to the external perturbations. The method requires temporal profiles of total abundances of each of the 36 representative OTUs, which were obtained by scaling their normalized abundance from the pyrosequencing run (fraction ranging from 0 to 1) by the total amount of bacteria DNA recovered from each gram of stool or intestinal content. The temporal profile of theC. difficiletotal abundance was obtained from the c.f.u. counts recovered by plating the caecal content after mouse euthanasia. The last time differences,, were calculated for each mouse as the difference between the total abundance in the intestinal content (faeces) on the day afterC. difficileinoculation,, (also the day of mouse euthanasia) minus the total abundance in the content (faeces) beforeC. difficileinfection or. Similarly the differential profile forC. difficilewas evaluated from the log-difference in the scaled colony counts for the corresponding faecal and caecal samples. Antibiotic perturbations (ampicillin, clindamycin, or enrofloxacin) were modelled as a discrete signal when administered at day −2 (Fig. 1). The inference algorithm was run on a total of 240 samples and the global model was selected with a threefold cross-validation scheme on the 75 combined time courses to ensure robustness to the introduction of unseen data10. In particular, the number of data points outnumbers the number of unknowns; that is, the linear system to be solved is overdetermined, ensuring a sufficient number of constraints by the data for inferring the unknown coefficients.
Inference modelling of allo-HSCT patient microbiota time-seriesTo determine whether commensal–C. difficileinteractions observed in the mouse data were also conserved in humans, we applied the same inference-modelling framework to data from 24 allo-HSTC hospitalized patients. As above, for each of the 36 OTUs, we determined the log-differential in total abundance as the log-difference of the normalized abundance scaled by the corresponding total bacterial DNA per gram of stool at the next sampling event minus the total abundance at the current sampling time. Differential abundance inC. difficilewas determined from the rtPCR measurements of theC. difficile16S rRNA gene per gram of faeces. Similarly to the above, we ran the algorithm on a total of 112 samples and the global model was selected applying a threefold cross-validation scheme on the 24 combined time courses. This choice again yields an overdetermined linear system to be solved.

Editorial SummaryGut bacteria providing resistance toClostridium difficileAntibiotic treatment can kill many members of the normal commensal gut microbiota, leaving patients susceptible to intestinal infection. Among infections that can result from antibiotic-mediated commensal flora destruction,Clostridium difficilecolitis is one of the most common and difficult to treat. Eric Pamer and colleagues screened the mouse microbiota with a panel of antibiotics and looked for distinct microbiota changes associated with susceptibility toC. difficile. They identified resistance-associated microbiota constituents common to mice and humans, includingClostridium scindens, which they show confers resistance to infection by synthesizingC. difficile-inhibiting metabolites from host-derived bile salts. These findings could point the way towards novel approaches to the treatment and prevention ofC. difficilecolitis such as replenishment of secondary bile acids or biosynthesis-competent bacteria as adjuncts to faecal microbiota transplants.
