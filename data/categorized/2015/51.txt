Research on mindfulness meditation faces a number of important challenges in study design that limit the interpretation of existing studies.
A number of changes in brain structure have been related to mindfulness meditation.
Mindfulness practice enhances attention. The anterior cingulate cortex is the region associated with attention in which changes in activity and/or structure in response to mindfulness meditation are most consistently reported.
Mindfulness practice improves emotion regulation and reduces stress. Fronto-limbic networks involved in these processes show various patterns of engagement by mindfulness meditation.
Meditation practice has the potential to affect self-referential processing and improve present-moment awareness. The default mode networks — including the midline prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex, which support self-awareness — could be altered following mindfulness training.
Mindfulness meditation has potential for the treatment of clinical disorders and might facilitate the cultivation of a healthy mind and increased well-being.
Future research into mindfulness meditation should use randomized and actively controlled longitudinal studies with large sample sizes to validate previous findings.
The effects of mindfulness practice on neural structure and function need to be linked to behavioural performance, such as cognitive, affective and social functioning, in future research.
The complex mental state of mindfulness is likely to be supported by the large-scale brain networks; future work should take this into account rather than being restricted to activations in single brain areas.
AbstractResearch over the past two decades broadly supports the claim that mindfulness meditation — practiced widely for the reduction of stress and promotion of health — exerts beneficial effects on physical and mental health, and cognitive performance. Recent neuroimaging studies have begun to uncover the brain areas and networks that mediate these positive effects. However, the underlying neural mechanisms remain unclear, and it is apparent that more methodologically rigorous studies are required if we are to gain a full understanding of the neuronal and molecular bases of the changes in the brain that accompany mindfulness meditation.

MainMeditation can be defined as a form of mental training that aims to improve an individual's core psychological capacities, such as attentional and emotional self-regulation. Meditation encompasses a family of complex practices that include mindfulness meditation, mantra meditation, yoga, tai chi and chi gong1. Of these practices, mindfulness meditation — often described as non-judgemental attention to present-moment experiences (Box 1) — has received most attention in neuroscience research over the past two decades2,3,4,5,6,7,8.
Although meditation research is in its infancy, a number of studies have investigated changes in brain activation (at rest and during specific tasks) that are associated with the practice of, or that follow, training in mindfulness meditation. These studies have reported changes in multiple aspects of mental function in beginner and advanced meditators, healthy individuals and patient populations9,10,11,12,13,14.
In this Review, we consider the current state of research on mindfulness meditation. We discuss the methodological challenges that the field faces and point to several shortcomings in existing studies. Taking into account some important theoretical considerations, we then discuss behavioural and neuroscientific findings in light of what we think are the core components of meditation practice: attention control, emotion regulation and self-awareness (Box 1). Within this framework, we describe research that has revealed changes in behaviour, brain activity and brain structure following mindfulness meditation training. We discuss what has been learned so far from this research and suggest new research strategies for the field. We focus here on mindfulness meditation practices and have excluded studies on other types of meditation. However, it is important to note that other styles of meditation may operate via distinct neural mechanisms15,16.
Box 1: Mindfulness meditationDifferent styles and forms of meditation are found in almost all cultures and religions. Mindfulness meditation originally stems from Buddhist meditation traditions3. Since the 1990s, mindfulness meditation has been applied to multiple mental and physical health conditions, and has received much attention in psychological research2,4,5,6,7. In current clinical and research contexts, mindfulness meditation is typically described as non-judgemental attention to experiences in the present moment3,4,5,6,7,8. This definition encompasses the Buddhist concepts of mindfulness and equanimity158and describes practices that require both the regulation of attention (in order to maintain the focus on immediate experiences, such as thoughts, emotions, body posture and sensations) and the ability to approach one's experiences with openness and acceptance2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,53,158,159,160,161. Mindfulness meditation can be subdivided into methods involving focused attention and those involving open monitoring of present-moment experience9.
The mindfulness practices that have been the subject of neuroscientific research comprise a broad range of methods and techniques, including Buddhist meditation traditions, such as Vipassana meditation, Dzogchen and Zen, as well as mindfulness-based approaches such as integrative body–mind training (IBMT), mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) and clinical interventions based on MBSR4,5,6. Both MBSR and IBMT have adopted mindfulness practices from the Buddhist traditions and aim to develop moment-to-moment, non-judgemental awareness through various techniques8,9,10,11,53,73. IBMT has been categorized in the literature as open-monitoring mindfulness meditation9,10,161, whereas MBSR includes both focused attention and open-monitoring practices8.
It has been suggested that mindfulness meditation includes at least three components that interact closely to constitute a process of enhanced self-regulation: enhanced attention control, improved emotion regulation and altered self-awareness (diminished self-referential processing and enhanced body awareness)10(see the figure, part a). Mindfulness meditation can be roughly divided into three different stages of practice — early, middle (intermediate) and advanced — that involve different amounts of effort11(see the figure, partb).
Challenges in meditation researchFindings on the effects of meditation on the brain are often reported enthusiastically by the media and used by clinicians and educators to inform their work. However, most of the findings have not yet been replicated. Many researchers are enthusiastic meditators themselves. Although their insider perspective may be valuable for a deep understanding of meditation, these researchers must ensure that they take a critical view of study outcomes. In fact, for meditation studies there is a relatively strong bias towards the publication of positive or significant results, as was shown in a meta-analysis17.
The methodological quality of many meditation research studies is still relatively low. Few are actively controlledlongitudinal studies, and sample sizes are small. As is typical for a young research field, many experiments are not yet based on elaborated theories, and conclusions are often drawn from post-hoc interpretations. These conclusions therefore remain tentative, and studies must be carefully replicated. Meditation research also faces several specific methodological challenges.
Cross-sectional versus longitudinal studies.
Early meditation studies were mostlycross-sectional studies: that is, they compared data from a group of meditators with data from a control group at one point in time. These studies investigated practitioners with hundreds or thousands of hours of meditation experience (such as Buddhist monks) and compared them with control groups of non-meditators matched on various dimensions9,18. The rationale was that any effects of meditation would be most easily detectable in highly experienced practitioners.
A number of cross-sectional studies revealed differences in brain structure and function associated with meditation (see below). Although these differences may constitute training-induced effects, a cross-sectional study design precludes causal attribution: it is possible that there are pre-existing differences in the brains of meditators, which might be linked to their interest in meditation, personality or temperament2,19. Althoughcorrelational studieshave attempted to discover whether more meditation experience is related to larger changes in brain structure or function, such correlations still cannot prove that meditation practice has caused the changes because it is possible that individuals with these particular brain characteristics may be drawn to longer meditation practice.
More recent research has used longitudinal designs, which compare data from one or more groups at several time points and ideally include a (preferably active) control condition and random assignment to conditions11,12,13,14,20,21,22,23,24,25. In meditation research, longitudinal studies are still relatively rare. Among those studies, some have investigated the effects of mindfulness training over just a few days, whereas others have investigated programmes of 1 to 3 months. Some of these studies have revealed changes in behaviour, brain structure and function11,12,13,14,20,21,22,23,24,25. A lack of similar changes in the control group suggests that meditation has caused the observed changes, especially when other potentially confounding variables are controlled for properly20,21,22.
Novice meditators versus expert meditators.
Although most cross-sectional studies included long-term meditators9,17, longitudinal studies are often conducted in beginners or naive subjects. Thus, differences in the results of cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses might be attributed to the different brain regions used during learning of meditation versus those used during the continued practice of an acquired skill. It would be interesting to follow subjects over a long-term period of practice to determine whether changes induced by meditation training persist in the absence of continued practice. However, such long-term longitudinal studies would be compromised by feasibility constraints, and it is likely that future longitudinal studies will remain restricted to relatively short training periods2.
Control groups and interventions.
It is important to control for variables that may be confounded with meditation training, such as changes in lifestyle and diet that might accompany the meditation practice or the expectancy and intention that meditation beginners bring to their practice. Researchers must carefully determine which variables are integral aspects of the meditation training and which can be controlled for. Some earlier studies only controlled for the length of time that the individual has practised meditation and the effects of repeated testing, but more recent studies have developed and included active interventions in control groups — such as stress management education26, relaxation training14,23,27or health enhancement programmes20,21,22— that can control for variables such as social interaction with the group and teachers, amount of home exercise, physical exercise and psychoeducation. These studies are therefore better able to extract and delineate the meditation-specific effects. For example, one study investigating short-term meditation training used a 'sham meditation' condition in which participants thought they were meditating, but did not receive proper meditation instructions, which allowed the researchers to control for factors such as expectancy, body posture and attention from the teacher28. Mechanistic studies ideally need to use interventions that are as effective as mindfulness meditation in producing the beneficial effects on target variables but that allow for assessment of the unique mechanism underlying the mindfulness practice23,29.
Control conditions in functional imaging.
Although all functional neuroimaging studies must use appropriate comparison conditions, this challenge is particularly important when imaging meditative states (Box 2). The comparison condition should be one in which a state of mindfulness meditation is not present. Many studies use resting comparison conditions, but a problem with this is that experienced practitioners are likely to enter into a state of meditation when at rest. However, other active tasks introduce additional brain activity that renders the comparison difficult to interpret. Using imaging protocols that do not rely onblood-oxygen-level-dependent contrasts(BOLD contrasts), such asarterial spin labelling, might be a possible solution for this problem30.
Box 2: Imaging the meditative stateAbrain statecan be defined as a reliable pattern of activity and/or connectivity in multiple large-scale brain networks11,73. Meditation training involves obtaining a meditative state, and measurements of behaviour and/or brain activity can be made while participants are thought to be in such a state15,76,162,163. These studies can elucidate how the state influences the brain and behaviour2,10,14,73. To identify brain regions activated during the state of meditation (compared to a baseline state) across multiple studies in experienced healthy meditators, an activation likelihood estimate meta-analysis of 10 studies with 91 subjects published before January 2011 was performed108. This revealed three areas in which there were clusters of activity: the caudate, which is thought (together with the putamen) to have a role in attentional disengagement from irrelevant information, allowing a meditative state to be achieved and maintained; the entorhinal cortex (parahippocampus), which is thought to control the mental stream of thoughts and possibly stop mind wandering; and the medial prefrontal cortex, which is thought to support the enhanced self-awareness during meditation108(also see Ref.
162). It was suggested that these regions of activity might represent a core cortical network for the meditative state, independent of the meditation technique. It is important to note, however, that this meta-analysis included mostly papers from traditions other than mindfulness.
Changes in brain structureIn the past decade, 21 studies have investigated alterations in brain morphometry related to mindfulness meditation17. These studies varied in regard to the exact mindfulness meditation tradition under investigation31,32,33,34,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52, and multiple measurements have been used to investigate effects on both grey and white matter. Studies have captured cortical thickness32,51, grey-matter volume and/or density33,40,fractional anisotropyandaxial and radial diffusivity38,39. These studies have also used different research designs. Most have made cross-sectional comparisons between experienced meditators and controls32,33,34; however, a few recent studies have investigated longitudinal changes in novice practitioners38,39,40. Some further studies have investigated correlations between brain changes and other variables related to mindfulness practice, such as stress reduction40, emotion regulation39or increased well-being47. Most studies include small sample sizes of between 10 and 34 subjects per group31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42.
Because the studies vary in regard to study design, measurement and type of mindfulness meditation, it is not surprising that the locations of reported effects are diverse and cover multiple regions in the brain31,32,33,34,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52. Effects reported by individual studies have been found in multiple brain regions, including the cerebral cortex, subcortical grey and white matter, brain stem and cerebellum, suggesting that the effects of meditation might involve large-scale brain networks. This is not surprising because mindfulness practice involves multiple aspects of mental function that use multiple complex interactive networks in the brain.
Table 1summarizes the main findings of structural neuroimaging studies on mindfulness meditation (grey and white matter).
Anactivation likelihood estimation meta-analysis, which also included studies from traditions other than mindfulness meditation, was conducted to investigate which regions were consistently altered in meditators across studies17. The findings demonstrated a global medium effect size, and eight brain regions were found to be consistently altered in meditators: the frontopolar cortex, which the authors suggest might be related to enhanced meta-awareness following meditation practice; the sensory cortices and insula, areas that have been related to body awareness; the hippocampus, a region that has been related to memory processes; the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), mid-cingulate cortex and orbitofrontal cortex, areas known to be related to self and emotion regulation; and the superior longitudinal fasciculus and corpus callosum, areas involved in intra- and inter-hemispherical communication17.
Thus, some initial attempts have been undertaken to investigate the brain regions that are structurally altered by the practice of meditation. However, our knowledge of what these changes actually mean will remain trivial until we gain a better understanding of how such structural changes are related to the reported improvements in affective, cognitive and social function. Very few studies have begun to relate findings in the brain to self-reported variables and behavioural measures34,39,47,48,51. Future studies therefore need to replicate the reported findings and begin to unravel how changes in the neural structure relate to changes in well-being and behaviour.
Growing evidence also demonstrates changes in the functional properties of the brain following meditation. Below, we summarize such findings in the context of the framework of core mechanisms of mindfulness meditation (Box 1;Fig. 1).
Schematic view of some of the brain regions involved in attention control (the anterior cingulate cortex and the striatum), emotion regulation (multiple prefrontal regions, limbic regions and the striatum) and self-awareness (the insula, medial prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus).
PowerPoint slideMindfulness and attentionMany meditation traditions emphasize the necessity to cultivate attention regulation early in the practice9,53. A sufficient degree of attentional control is required to stay engaged in meditation, and meditators often report improved attention control as an effect of repeated practice10,14. Multiple studies have experimentally investigated such effects54.
Components of attention.
Attention is often subdivided into three different components: alerting (readiness in preparation for an impending stimulus, which includes tonic effects that result from spending time on a task (vigilance) and phasic effects that are due to brain changes induced by warning signals or targets); orienting (the selection of specific information from multiple sensory stimuli); and conflict monitoring (monitoring and resolution of conflict between computations in different neural areas, also referred to as executive attention)55,56. Other distinctions between types of attention refer to combinations of these three components. For example, sustained attention refers to the sense of vigilance during long continued tasks and may involve both tonic alerting and orienting, whereas selective attention may involve either orienting (when a stimulus is present) or executive function (when stored information is involved).
Performance in these three basic domains can be measured with the attention network test (ANT)57. This test uses as a target an arrow pointing left or right. The target is surrounded by flankers, and subtracting reaction times to congruent stimuli (that is, those on the side of the screen indicated by the arrow) from reaction times to incongruent stimuli produces a measure of the time to resolve conflict. The inclusion of cues that indicate when or where the target will occur allows the measurement of alerting and orienting. These measures are used to quantify efficiency in each of the three networks that support the individual components of attention. Alerting involves the brain's noradrenaline system, which originates in the locus coeruleus. Orienting involves frontal and parietal areas, including the frontal eye fields and inferior and superior parietal lobe. The executive network involved in conflict resolution involves the ACC, anterior insula and basal ganglia58,59.
Effects of mindfulness meditation on attention.
The ANT and other experimental paradigms have been used to investigate the effects of meditation on attentional performance60. Improved conflict monitoring was reported in several studies14,61,62,63,64. For example, a longitudinal study showed that only 5 days (20 min per day) of integrative body–mind training (IBMT) led to improved conflict monitoring14. In addition, cross-sectional studies of 3 months of mindfulness meditation showed a reduced attentional blink (a lapse in attention following a stimulus within a rapid stream of presented stimuli that has been related to executive function65,66) following training64(also see Ref.
67). Better performance in conflict monitoring has also been demonstrated in experienced meditators in cross-sectional studies68. However, although altered attention is a common finding in these well-designed meditation studies, some studies investigating mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) have not observed effects on conflict monitoring69,70.
Most of the studies on the effects of short-term (1 week) mindfulness meditation on alerting have not found significant effects, but studies investigating long-term meditators (ranging from months to years) did detect changes in alerting27,70,71,72. Enhanced orienting has been reported in some cross-sectional studies using longer periods of training. For example, 3 months of Shamatha mindfulness training improved tonic alertness (the ability to remain alert over time) and allowed for improved orienting towards a visual target in comparison to controls71. However, 8 weeks of MBSR did not improve measures of sustained attention in a continuous performance task that measured aspects of tonic alertness, but did show some improvement in orienting22. We do not know whether the differences in the findings of these studies are due to the type of training, type of control or other subtle factors.
A systematic review that compiled the findings of these studies (as well as the effects on other measures of cognition) concluded that early phases of mindfulness meditation might be associated with improvements in conflict monitoring and orienting, whereas later phases might be mainly associated with improved alerting60. It is currently still unclear how different meditation practices differentially affect the specific attentional components2,9,53. In addition, the length of practice needs to be defined more consistently in future research.
Neural mechanisms of enhanced attention control.
Several functional and structural MRI studies on mindfulness training have investigated neuroplasticity in brain regions supporting attention regulation. The brain region to which the effects of mindfulness training on attention is most consistently linked is the ACC11,23,38,39,73,74,75,76. The ACC enables executive attention and control77,78,79by detecting the presence of conflicts emerging from incompatible streams of information processing. The ACC and the fronto-insular cortex form part of a network that facilitates cognitive processing through long-range connections to other brain areas11,80. Cross-sectional studies have reported enhanced activation of regions of the ACC in experienced meditators compared to controls during focused attention meditation76or when mindfully anticipating delivery of a painful stimulus81. Greater activation of the ventral and/or rostral ACC during the resting state following 5 days of IBMT was also found in an actively controlled, randomized, longitudinal study23. Although ACC activation may be enhanced in earlier stages of mindfulness meditation, it might decrease with higher levels of expertise, as demonstrated in a cross-sectional study18. Structural MRI data suggest that mindfulness meditation might be associated with greater cortical thickness51and might lead to enhanced white-matter integrity in the ACC38,39.
Other attention-related brain regions in which functional changes have been observed following mindfulness meditation include the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC), where responses were enhanced during executive processing82, as revealed by a randomized longitudinal study, and parietal attention regions, which showed greater activation following an MBSR course in people with social anxiety, as demonstrated by an uncontrolled longitudinal study83. Furthermore, a diminished age-related decline of grey-matter volume in the putamen as well as diminished age-related decline in sustained attention performance were found in a cross-sectional study of Zen meditation practitioners34.
Although there is evidence that brain regions relevant for the regulation of attention show functional and structural changes following mindfulness meditation practice, it has not yet been determined whether these changes are actually related to the improved attentional performance. Longitudinal studies that use measures of attentional performance along with functional MRI (fMRI) are needed. If supported by more rigorous future research, the evidence of improved attention regulation and strengthened brain activity in the regions underlying attentional control following mindfulness meditation might be promising for the treatment of psychiatric disorders in which there are deficiencies in these functions74,84,85.
Mindfulness and emotion regulationEnhanced emotion regulation has been suggested to underlie many of the beneficial effects of mindfulness meditation. Emotion regulation refers to strategies that can influence which emotions arise and when, how long they occur, and how these emotions are experienced and expressed. A range of implicit and explicit emotion regulation processes has been proposed86, and mindfulness-based emotion regulation may involve a mix of these processes, including attentional deployment (attending to mental processes, including emotions), cognitive change (altering typical patterns of appraisal regarding one's emotions) and response modulation (decreasing tonic levels of suppression).
Effects of mindfulness meditation on emotion regulation.
Improvements in emotion regulation associated with mindfulness meditation have been investigated through various approaches, including experimental studies, self-reporting studies, measurement of peripheral physiology and neuroimaging10. These studies have reported various positive effects of mindfulness meditation on emotional processing, such as a reduction in emotional interference by unpleasant stimuli87, decreased physiological reactivity and facilitated return to emotional baseline after response to a stressor film88, and decreased self-reported difficulties in emotion regulation89. Consequently, lowered intensity and frequency of negative affect90,91and improved positive mood states14,91,92are reported to be associated with mindfulness meditation.
Neural mechanisms of improved emotion regulation.
Neuroimaging studies that have probed the enhanced emotion regulation associated with mindfulness meditation in an attempt to identify the underlying brain activation patterns typically present study participants with emotional pictures82,93,94,95,96,97, words and/or statements29,98and instruct them to encounter these with a state of mindfulness or a simple baseline state.
The hypothesis that drives many of these studies is that mindful emotion regulation works by strengthening prefrontal cognitive control mechanisms and thus downregulates activity in regions relevant to affect processing, such as the amygdala. Present-moment awareness and non-judgemental acceptance through mindfulness meditation8,10are thought to be crucial in promoting cognitive control because they increase sensitivity to affective cues that help to signal the need for control99. Studies have therefore investigated whether mindfulness training exerts its effects through enhanced top-down control or facilitated bottom-up processing100. The findings (outlined below) suggest that the level of expertise is important, with beginners showing a different pattern from expert meditators. However, although several studies have pointed to the involvement of fronto-limbic regions, very few studies have begun to relate changes in these regions to changes in measures of behaviour or well-being10.
A frequently reported finding is that mindfulness practice leads to (or is associated with) a diminished activation of the amygdala in response to emotional stimuli during mindful states83,94,95as well as in a resting state93, suggesting a decrease in emotional arousal. However, although such results have been reported for meditation beginners, they have less consistently been detected in experienced meditators95(but see Ref.
18).
Prefrontal activations are often enhanced as an effect of mindfulness meditation in novice meditators (but see Ref.
29): for example, greater dorsolateral PFC responses were found during executive processing within an emotional Stroop task in healthy individuals after 6 weeks of mindfulness training82. Enhanced dorsomedial and dorsolateral PFC activation was also detected when participants expected to see negative images while engaging in a mindful state94. Moreover, after an MBSR course, an enhanced activation in the ventrolateral PFC in people suffering from anxiety was found when they labelled the affect of emotional images97. By contrast, experienced meditators have been found to show diminished activation in medial PFC regions95. This finding could be interpreted as indicating reduced control (disengagement of elaboration and appraisal) and greater acceptance of affective states.
Neuroimaging studies of ameliorated pain processing through mindfulness meditation have also pointed to expertise-related differences in the extent of cognitive control over sensory experience. Meditation beginners showed increased activity in areas involved in the cognitive regulation of nociceptive processing (the ACC and anterior insula) and areas involved in reframing the evaluation of stimuli (the orbitofrontal cortex), along with reduced activation in the primary somatosensory cortex in a 4-day longitudinal study with no control group30, whereas meditation experts were characterized by decreased activation in dorsolateral and ventrolateral PFC regions and enhancements in primary pain processing regions (the insula, somatosensory cortex and thalamus) compared with controls in two cross-sectional studies35,81.
These findings are in line with the assumption that the process of mindfulness meditation is characterized as an active cognitive regulation in meditation beginners, who need to overcome habitual ways of internally reacting to one's emotions and might therefore show greater prefrontal activation. Expert meditators might not use this prefrontal control. Rather, they might have automated an accepting stance towards their experience and thus no longer engage in top-down control efforts but instead show enhanced bottom-up processing100.
In the early stages of meditation training, achieving the meditation state seems to involve the use of attentional control and mental effort; thus, areas of the lateral prefrontal and parietal cortex are more active than before training11,16,100,101. This may reflect the higher level of effort often found when participants struggle to obtain the meditation state in the early stages11,73,98,102. However, in the advanced stages, prefrontal–parietal activity is often reduced or eliminated, but ACC, striatum and insula activity remains9,10,53,73,76,101,102,103. Whether effort has a key role in PFC and ACC activation during or following meditation needs further investigation.
Analysis of functional connectivity between regions of the fronto-limbic network could help to further elucidate the regulatory function of executive control regions. Only a few studies have included such analyses. One cross-sectional study on pain processing in meditators demonstrated decreased connectivity of executive and pain-related brain regions35, and one study of mindfulness-naive smokers demonstrated reduced connectivity between craving-related brain regions during a mindfulness condition compared to passive viewing of smoking-related images during cigarette craving96, suggesting a functional decoupling of involved regions. Another longitudinal, randomized study reported that people suffering from anxiety showed a change from a negative correlation between the activity of frontal regions and that of the amygdala before intervention (that is, negative connectivity) to a positive correlation between the activity of these regions (positive connectivity) after a mindfulness intervention97. Because such a negative correlation will occur when prefrontal regions downregulate limbic activation104,105, it was speculated that the positive coupling between the activity of the two regions after mindfulness intervention might indicate that meditation involves monitoring of arousal rather than a downregulation or suppression of emotional responses, and that it might be a unique signature of mindful emotion regulation. Importantly, this study also investigated the correlation between neural and self-reported findings and demonstrated that the changes in PFC–amygdala connectivity were correlated with anxiety symptom improvement. Further studies are needed to elucidate the complex interplay between regions of the fronto-limbic network in mindfulness meditation.
Although the proposed similarities between mindfulness and the reappraisal strategy of emotion regulation have been much debated, there is some evidence that mindfulness also shares similarities with extinction processes (Box 3).
Brain regions involved in motivation and reward processing also show functional alterations that are related to mindfulness training, such as stronger activity of the putamen and caudate during a resting state following mindfulness training23and lower activation in the caudate nucleus during reward anticipation in experienced meditators106. These studies might indicate altered self-regulation in the motivational realm, with possibly reduced susceptibility to incentives and enhanced reward-related activity during rest.
Brain regions involved in the regulation of emotions have also shown structural changes following mindfulness meditation31,32,38,39,40,41,48,51. Although these findings provide some initial evidence that these brain regions are related to mindfulness practice, the question of whether they are involved in mediating the beneficial effects of mindfulness meditation remains largely unanswered.
Box 3: Mindfulness meditation as exposure therapyExposure therapy aims for patients to extinguish a fear response and instead to acquire a sense of safety in the presence of a formerly feared stimulus by exposing them to that stimulus and preventing the usual response164. Mindfulness meditation resembles an exposure situation because practitioners 'turn towards their emotional experience', bring acceptance to bodily and affective responses, and refrain from engaging in internal reactivity towards it. Research on fear conditioning has helped to identify a network of brain regions that are crucial for the extinction of conditioned fear responses and the retention of extinction165. This network includes the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), which is important for a successful recall of the extinction; the hippocampus166, which is related to signalling the extinguished context (contextual safety); and the amygdala, which has a crucial role during the acquisition and expression of conditioned fear167and is thought to be downregulated by the vmPFC and the hippocampus105,168. Activation in the vmPFC (subgenual anterior cingulate cortex) is primarily linked to the expression of fear learning during a delayed test of extinction and is critical for the retention of extinction169.
There is emerging evidence from MRI studies that the aforementioned brain regions show structural and functional changes following mindfulness meditation training (see main text). This overlap of involved brain regions, as well as the conceptual similarity between mindfulness and an exposure situation, suggest that mindfulness training might enhance the ability to extinguish conditioned fear by structurally and functionally affecting the brain network that supports safety signalling. The capacity for successful extinction memories reliably differentiates healthy from pathological conditions170,171, and is crucial in order to overcome maladaptive states. It helps individuals to learn to have no fear response to neutral stimuli when there is no adaptive function for a fear response. Instead, individuals can experience a sense of safety and can flexibly elicit other emotions and behaviours.
Mindfulness and self-awarenessAccording to Buddhist philosophy, the identification with a static concept of 'self' causes psychological distress. Dis-identification from such a static self-concept results in the freedom to experience a more genuine way of being. Through enhanced meta-awareness (making awareness itself an object of attention), mindfulness meditation is thought to facilitate a detachment from identification with the self as a static entity3,10,107and a tendency to identify with the phenomenon of 'experiencing' itself is said to emerge15,108,109,110,111,112. Currently, empirical research into this area is only just emerging111,113, and the few interpretations of connections between neuroimaging findings and self-reported data — which we will summarize briefly below — are suggestive at best.
Self-referential processing.
Altered self-representation has been investigated with questionnaire studies. Early studies reported mindfulness training to be associated with a more positive self-representation, higher self-esteem, higher acceptance of oneself114and styles of self-concept that are typically associated with less-severe pathological symptoms115. Meditators have also been shown to score higher than non-meditators on a scale that measures non-attachment116: a construct that is based on insight into the constructed and impermanent nature of mental representations. Although such concepts are not easy to capture in experimental and neuroscientific studies, findings from a few recent studies seem to suggest that brain structures supporting self-referential processing might be affected by mindfulness meditation98,117,118.
Although there is much debate about its exact function, a widespread view holds that the default mode network (DMN)119,120is involved in self-referential processing. This network includes midline structures of the brain, such as areas of the medial PFC, posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), anterior precuneus and inferior parietal lobule121,122. These structures show high activity during rest, mind wandering and conditions of stimulus-independent thought121and have been suggested to support diverse mechanisms by which an individual can 'project' themselves into another perspective123. fMRI studies have investigated activity in the DMN in association with mindfulness practice. Regions of the DMN (the medial PFC and PCC) showed relatively little activity in meditators compared to controls across different types of meditation, which has been interpreted as indicating diminished self-referential processing117. Functional connectivity analysis revealed stronger coupling in experienced meditators between the PCC, dorsal ACC and dorsolateral PFC, both at baseline and during meditation, which was interpreted as indicating increased cognitive control over the function of the DMN117. Increased functional connectivity was also found between DMN regions and the ventromedial PFC in participants with more compared to less meditation experience118. It has been speculated that this increased connectivity with ventromedial PFC regions supports greater access of the default circuitry to information about internal states because this region is highly interconnected with limbic regions118.
Awareness of present-moment experiences.
Evaluative self-referential processing is assumed to decrease as an effect of mindfulness meditation, whereas awareness of present-moment experiences is thought to be enhanced. Mindfulness practitioners often report that the practice of attending to present-moment body sensations results in an enhanced awareness of bodily states and greater perceptual clarity of subtle interoception. Empirical findings to support this claim are mixed. Although studies that assessed performance on a heartbeat detection task — a standard measure of interoceptive awareness — found no evidence that meditators had superior performance to non-meditators124,125, other studies found that meditators showed greater coherence between objective physiological data and their subjective experience in regard to an emotional experience126and the sensitivity of body regions127.
Multiple studies have shown the insula to be implicated in mindfulness meditation: it shows stronger activation during compassion meditation128and following mindfulness training23,52,98, and has greater cortical thickness in experienced meditators32. Given its known role in awareness129, it is conceivable that enhanced insula activity in meditators might represent the amplified awareness of present-moment experience.
Similarly, a study reported an uncoupling of the right insula and medial PFC and increased connectivity of the right insula with dorsolateral PFC regions in individuals after mindfulness training98. The authors interpret their findings as a shift in self-referential processing towards a more self-detached and objective analysis of interoceptive and exteroceptive sensory events, rather than their affective or subjective self-referential value. Furthermore, a preliminary analysis from a study of a state of 'non-dual awareness' (a state of awareness in which perceived dualities, such as the distinction between subject and object, are absent) showed a decreased functional connectivity of the central precuneus with the dorsolateral PFC. The author speculates that this finding might be indicative of a state in which awareness is itself the subject of awareness111.
Together, the findings from these studies have been taken to suggest that mindfulness meditation might alter the self-referential mode so that a previous narrative, evaluative form of self-referential processing is replaced by greater awareness98,111. We suggest that this shift in self-awareness is one of the major active mechanisms of the beneficial effects of mindfulness meditation. However, because these interpretations are built on a still-fragmentary understanding of the function of the involved brain regions, future research will need to test and elaborate these assumptions.
Across the functional and structural MRI studies that have been published to date, especially those based on the longitudinal, randomized, controlled studies with active control groups and meta-analyses, the ACC, PFC, PCC, insula, striatum (caudate and putamen) and amygdala seem to show consistent changes associated with mindfulness meditation9,10,11,13,17,23,34,73,108,130(Fig. 1;Table 2). We consider these areas to be the core regions involved in self-regulation of attention, emotion and awareness following mindfulness training. However, we acknowledge that many other brain areas are also involved in mindfulness practice and warrant further investigation using rigorous randomized and controlled designs.
Future questionsMechanisms of mindfulness-induced changes.
A number of studies seem to suggest that mindfulness meditation induces changes in brain structure and function, raising the question of which underlying mechanisms support these processes. It is possible that engaging the brain in mindfulness affects brain structure by inducing dendritic branching, synaptogenesis, myelinogenesis or even adult neurogenesis. Alternatively, it is possible that mindfulness positively affects autonomic regulation and immune activity, which may result in neuronal preservation, restoration and/or inhibition of apoptosis14,23,131. It is well known that mindfulness-based techniques are highly effective in stress reduction, and it is possible that such stress reduction may mediate changes in brain function14,48,132,133,134,135,136,137(Box 4). A combination of all of these mechanisms may even occur.
It is also important to realize that the direction of the observed effects of mindfulness meditation has not been consistent across all studies. Although larger values in meditators compared to controls are predominantly reported, a cross-sectional study also revealed smaller fractional anisotropy and cortical thickness values in meditators in some brain regions, including the medial PFC, postcentral and inferior parietal cortices, PCC and medial occipital cortex138. Along these lines, mindfulness-induced increases are predominantly observed in longitudinal studies. However, it was also reported, for example, that as a consequence of meditation, larger decreases in perceived stress were associated with larger decreases in grey-matter density in the amygdala48. Thus, the underlying mechanisms seem to be more complex than currently assumed, and further research is necessary.
Although neuroimaging has advanced our understanding of the individual brain regions involved in mindfulness meditation, most evidence supports the idea that the brain processes information through the dynamic interactions of distributed areas operating in large-scale networks139,140. Because the complex mental state of mindfulness is probably supported by alterations in large-scale brain networks, future work should consider the inclusion of complex network analyses, rather than restricting analyses to comparisons of the strength of activations in single brain areas. Recent studies have explored functional network architecture during the resting state using these new tools141,142.
Decoding mental states.
Mindfulness meditation approaches can be divided into those involving focused attention and those involving open monitoring. Even within the same meditation style, practitioners can be at different stages of mindfulness practice2. Investigating the distinction between these different stages in terms of brain function will require new advanced tools and methods. For instance, simultaneous multi-level recording — using fMRI and electrophysiology — could provide information on how the brain and body interact to support the meditation practice143. Electroencephalography feedback has been used to aid training and study meditation by providing the practitioners with information on the brain waves they are producing. Similarly, real-time fMRI has been used to provide subjects with feedback of the brain activity they are producing and allows the experimenter to examine pain, cognitive control, emotion regulation and learning of meditation. This dynamic recording and feedback technique may help to train the subjects effectively and allow their mental states at different stages of mindfulness training to be decoded from their brain activity144,145,146, possibly by applying techniques such asmultivariate pattern analysis147.
Interpretations of study outcomes remain tentative until they are clearly linked to subjective reports or behavioural findings. Future studies should therefore increasingly draw connections between behavioural outcomes and neuroimaging data using the advanced multi-level analyses mentioned above.
Investigating individual differences.
People respond to mindfulness meditation differently. These differences may derive from temperamental, personality or genetic differences. Studies in other fields have suggested that genetic polymorphisms may interact with experience to influence the success of training148. Because mindfulness meditation affects the activation and connectivity of the ACC, PFC and other brain regions involved in cognitive control and emotion regulation, it might be helpful to examine these polymorphisms to determine their possible influence on the success of meditation practice2,59,149. Moreover, individual differences in personality, lifestyle, life events and trainer–trainee dynamics are likely to have substantial influence on training effects, although little is known about these influences. Mood and personality have been used to predict individual variation in the improvement of creative performance following mindfulness meditation150. Capturing temperament and personality differences may serve to predict success in mindfulness training150,151because different temperament and personality traits are reported to be associated with different electroencephalography patterns and heart-rate variability in Zen meditators152.
Clinical application.
Self-regulation deficits are associated with diverse behavioural problems and mental disorders, such as increased risk of school failure, attention deficit disorder, anxiety, depression and drug abuse78,153. Convergent findings indicate that mindfulness meditation could ameliorate negative outcomes resulting from deficits in self-regulation and could consequently help patient populations suffering from diseases and behavioural abnormalities. Several clinical trials have explored the effects of mindfulness meditation on disorders such as depression154, generalized anxiety26, addictions155, attention deficit disorders156and others42, and have begun to establish the efficiency of mindfulness practice for these conditions. Only a few recent studies, however, have investigated the neuroplastic changes underlying these beneficial effects of mindfulness in clinical populations29,41,42,74,97,142,157. Although these studies are promising, future work needs to replicate and expand the emerging findings to optimally tailor interventions for clinical application.
Box 4: Mindfulness meditation and stressStress reduction might be a potential mediator of the effects of mindfulness practice on neural function. Mindfulness meditation has been shown to reduce stress14,132,133,134,135,136,137; this is most consistently documented in self-reported data132,133. A review of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) studies showed a non-specific effect on stress reduction, which is similar to that of standard relaxation training134. However, findings in studies that have examined biomarkers of stress, such as cortisol levels, are less consistent: changes in cortisol levels have been found in association with mindfulness training in some studies14,136but not in others132,135.
The brain is a target for stress and stress-related hormones. It undergoes functional and structural remodelling in response to stress in a manner that is adaptive under normal circumstances but can lead to damage when stress is excessive172. Evidence suggests that vulnerability to stress-induced brain plasticity is prominent in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), hippocampus, amygdala and other areas associated with fear-related memories and self-regulatory behaviours172,173. The interactions between these brain regions determine whether life experiences lead to successful adaptation or maladaptation and impaired mental and physical health173. A study has shown that chronic stress induces less flexibility in attention shifting in the rodent and human adult174. This was paralleled by a reduction in apical dendritic arborization in rodent medial PFC (specifically, in the anterior cingulate cortex) and fewer feedforward PFC connections in humans under stress, effects that recovered when the stressor was removed174. This suggests that the effects of chronic psychosocial stress on PFC function and connectivity are plastic and can change quickly as a function of mental state174. Studies have also shown that moderate to severe stress seems to increase the volume of the amygdala but reduce the volume of the PFC and hippocampus175. Mindfulness training, however, has been shown to enhance grey-matter density in the hippocampus40. Furthermore, after mindfulness training, reductions in perceived stress correlate with reductions in amygdala grey-matter density48. These findings suggest that mindfulness meditation might be a potential intervention and prevention strategy176. Thus, it is possible that mindfulness meditation reduces stress by improving self-regulation, which enhances neuroplasticity and leads to health benefits. It should be noted that mindfulness meditation might also directly modulate stress processing via a 'bottom-up' pathway, through which it alters the sympathetic–adrenal–medullary and hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axes by increasing activity in the parasympathetic nervous system; thus, mindfulness meditation could prevent sympathetic nervous system fight-or-flight stress responses177,178. Indeed, some research has suggested that mindfulness leads to increased activity of the parasympathetic nervous system23,179.
Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has been linked to numerous aspects of plasticity in the brain. Stress-induced remodelling of the PFC, hippocampus and amygdala coincides with changes in the levels of BDNF, supporting its role as a trophic factor modulating neuronal survival and regulating synaptic plasticity131. However, glucocorticoids and other molecules have been shown to act in conjunction with BDNF to facilitate both morphological and molecular changes. Because some forms of mindfulness meditation training have been found to reduce stress-induced cortisol secretion, this could potentially have neuroprotective effects by increasing levels of BDNF, and future research should explore this possible causal relationship136,149,180.
ConclusionsInterest in the psychological and neuroscientific investigation of mindfulness meditation has increased markedly over the past two decades. As is relatively common in a new field of research, studies suffer from low methodological quality and present with speculative post-hoc interpretations. Knowledge of the mechanisms that underlie the effects of meditation is therefore still in its infancy. However, there is emerging evidence that mindfulness meditation might cause neuroplastic changes in the structure and function of brain regions involved in regulation of attention, emotion and self-awareness. Further research needs to use longitudinal, randomized and actively controlled research designs and larger sample sizes to advance the understanding of the mechanisms of mindfulness meditation in regard to the interactions of complex brain networks, and needs to connect neuroscientific findings with behavioural data. If supported by rigorous research studies, the practice of mindfulness meditation might be promising for the treatment of clinical disorders and might facilitate the cultivation of a healthy mind and increased well-being.

PowerPoint slidesPowerPoint slide for Fig. 1PowerPoint slide for Table 1PowerPoint slide for Table 2GlossaryStudy designs that compare data from one or more groups at several time points and that ideally include a (preferably active) control condition and random assignment to conditions.
Study designs that compare data from an experimental group with those from a control group at one point in time.
Studies that assess the co-variation between two variables: for example, co-variation of functional or structural properties of the brain and a behavioural variable, such as reported stress.
(BOLD contrasts). Signals that can be extracted with functional MRI and that reflect the change in the amount of deoxyhaemoglobin that is induced by changes in the activity of neurons and their synapses in a region of the brain. The signals thus reflect the activity in a local brain region.
(ASL). An MRI technique that is capable of measuring cerebral blood flowin vivo. It provides cerebral perfusion maps without requiring the administration of a contrast agent or the use of ionizing radiation because it uses magnetically labelled endogenous blood water as a freely diffusible tracer.
The reliable patterns of brain activity that involve the activation and/or connectivity of multiple large-scale brain networks.
A parameter in diffusion tensor imaging, which images brain structures by measuring the diffusion properties of water molecules. It provides information about the microstructural integrity of white matter.
Derived from the eigenvalues of the diffusion tensor, their underlying biophysical properties are associated with axonal density and myelination, respectively.
A technique for coordinate-based meta-analysis of neuroimaging data. It determines the convergence of foci reported from different experiments, weighted by the number of participants in each study.
A method of analysing functional MRI data that is capable of detecting and characterizing information represented in patterns of activity distributed within and across multiple regions of the brain. Unlike univariate approaches, which only identify magnitudes of activity in localized parts of the brain, this approach can monitor multiple areas at once.
