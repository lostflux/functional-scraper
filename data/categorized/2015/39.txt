AdvertisementMeasuring entanglement entropy in a quantum many-body systemNaturevolume528,pages77–83 (2015)Cite this article25kAccesses589Citations46AltmetricMetricsdetailsSubjectsAbstractEntanglement is one of the most intriguing features of quantum mechanics. It describes non-local correlations between quantum objects, and is at the heart of quantum information sciences. Entanglement is now being studied in diverse fields ranging from condensed matter to quantum gravity. However, measuring entanglement remains a challenge. This is especially so in systems of interacting delocalized particles, for which a direct experimental measurement of spatial entanglement has been elusive. Here, we measure entanglement in such a system of itinerant particles using quantum interference of many-body twins. Making use of our single-site-resolved control of ultracold bosonic atoms in optical lattices, we prepare two identical copies of a many-body state and interfere them. This enables us to directly measure quantum purity, Rényi entanglement entropy, and mutual information. These experiments pave the way for using entanglement to characterize quantum phases and dynamics of strongly correlated many-body systems.

MainEntangled quantum objects1are correlated in ways that reject the principle of local realism. In few-level quantum systems, entangled states have been investigated extensively as a means of studying the foundations of quantum mechanics2and as a resource for quantum information applications3. Recently, it was realized that the concept of entanglement has broad impact in many areas of quantum many-body physics, ranging from condensed matter4to high-energy field theory5and quantum gravity6. In this general context, entanglement is most often quantified by the entropy of entanglement1that arises in a subsystem when the information about the remaining system is ignored. This entanglement entropy exhibits qualitatively different behaviour from that of classical entropy and has been used in theoretical physics to probe various properties of many-body systems. In condensed matter physics, for example, the scaling behaviour7of entanglement entropy allows phases to be distinguished that cannot be characterized by symmetry properties, such as topological states of matter8,9,10and spin liquids11,12. Entanglement entropy can be used to probe quantum criticality13and non-equilibrium dynamics14,15, and to determine whether efficient numerical techniques for computing many-body physics exist16.
Despite the growing importance of entanglement in theoretical physics, current condensed matter experiments do not have a direct probe with which to detect and measure entanglement. Synthetic quantum systems such as cold atoms17,18, photonic networks19, and some microscopic solid state devices20have unique advantages: in such systems control and detection of single particles are possible, they provide experimental access to relevant dynamical timescales, and they are isolated from the environment. In these systems, specific entangled states of few qubits, such as the highly entangled Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger (GHZ) state21have been experimentally created and detected using witness operators22. However, entanglement witnesses are state specific. For arbitrary states, an exhaustive method of reconstructing the entire quantum state by tomography23can be used to measure entanglement. This has been accomplished in small systems of photonic qubits24and trapped ion spins25, but there is no known way to perform tomography for systems involving itinerant delocalized particles. With multiple copies of a system, however, one can use quantum many-body interference to quantify entanglement even in itinerant systems15,26,27.
In this work, we take advantage of the precise control and readout afforded by our quantum gas microscope28to prepare and interfere two identical copies of a four-site Bose–Hubbard system. This many-body quantum interference enables us to measure quantities that are not directly accessible in a single system (without tomography), for example, quadratic functions of the density matrix15,26,27,29,30,31,32. Such nonlinear functions can reveal entanglement1. In our system, we directly measure the quantum purity, Rényi entanglement entropy, and mutual information to probe the entanglement in site occupation numbers.
Bipartite entanglementTo detect entanglement in our system, we use a fundamental property of entanglement between two subsystems (bipartite entanglement): ignoring information about one subsystem results in the other becoming a classical mixture of pure quantum states. This classical mixture in a density matrixρcan be quantified by measuring the quantum purity, defined as Tr(ρ2). For a pure quantum state the density matrix is a projector and Tr(ρ2) = 1, whereas for a mixed state Tr(ρ2) < 1. In the case of a product state, the subsystems A and B of a many-body system AB described by a separable wavefunction |ψAB〉 (Fig. 1) are individually pure as well, that is,. Here the reduced density matrix of A isρA= TrB(ρAB), whereρAB= |ψAB〉〈ψAB| is the density matrix of the full system. TrBindicates tracing over or ignoring all information about the subsystem B. For an entangled state, the subsystems become less pure compared to the full system as the correlations between A and B are ignored in the reduced density matrix,Even if the many-body state is mixed (), it is still possible to measure entanglement between the subsystems1. It is sufficient33to prove this entanglement by showing that the subsystems are less pure than the full system, that is:These inequalities provide a powerful tool with which to detect entanglement in the presence of experimental imperfections. Furthermore, quantitative bounds on the entanglement present in a mixed many-body state can be obtained from these state purities34.
A generic pure quantum many-body state has quantum correlations (shown as arrows) between different parts. If the system is divided into two subsystems A and B, the subsystems will be bipartite entangled with each other when there are quantum correlations between them (right column). Only when there is no bipartite entanglement present, the partitioned system |ψAB〉 can be described as a product of subsystem states |ψA〉 and |ψB〉 (left column). A path for measuring the bipartite entanglement emerges from the concept of partial measurements: ignoring all information about subsystem B (indicated as ‘Trace’) will put subsystem A into a statistical mixture, to a degree given by the amount of bipartite entanglement present. Finding ways of measuring the many-body quantum state purity of the system and comparing that of its subsystems would then enable measurements of entanglement. For an entangled state, the subsystems will have less purity than the full system.
PowerPoint slideEquation (1) can be framed in terms of entropic quantities1,33. A particularly useful and well studied quantity is thenth-order Rényi entropy:From equation (2), we see that the second-order (n= 2) Rényi entropy and purity are related by.
S2(A) provides a lower bound15for the von Neumann entanglement entropySVN(A) =S1(A) = −Tr(ρAlogρA), which has been extensively studied theoretically. The Rényi entropies are rapidly gaining importance in theoretical condensed matter physics because they can be used to extract information about the “entanglement spectrum”35, thus providing more complete knowledge about the quantum state than just the von Neuman entropy. In terms of the second-order Rényi entropy, the conditions sufficient to demonstrate entanglement1,33becomeS2(A) >S2(AB), andS2(B) >S2(AB), that is, the subsystems have more entropy than the full system. These entropic inequalities are more powerful in detecting certain entangled states than other inequalities such as the Clauser–Horne–Shimony–Holt (CHSH) inequality30,33.
Measurement of quantum purityThe quantum purity and hence the second-order Rényi entropy can be directly measured by interfering two identical and independent copies of the quantum state on a 50%–50% beam splitter15,26,27,30. For two identical copies of a bosonic Fock state, the output ports always have even particle numbers, as illustrated inFig. 2a. This is due to the destructive interference of all odd outcomes. If the system is composed of multiple modes, such as internal spin states or various lattice sites the expectation value of the total number parityis equal to unity in the output portsi= 1, 2. Here the parity for modekisfor even or odd numbers of particles, respectively.
a, When twoN-particle bosonic systems that are in identical pure quantum states are interfered on a 50%–50% beam splitter, they always produce output states with an even number of particles in each copy. This is due to the destructive interference of odd outcomes and represents a generalized HOM interference, in which two identical photons always appear in pairs after interfering on a beam splitter.
b, If the input statesρ1andρ2are not perfectly identical or not perfectly pure, the interference contrast is reduced. In this case the expectation value of the parity of particle number 〈Pi〉 in either output (i= 1, 2) measures the quantum state overlap between the two input states. For two identical input statesρ1=ρ2, the average parity 〈Pi〉 therefore directly measures the quantum purity of the states. We assume only that the input states have no relative macroscopic phase relationship.
PowerPoint slideThe well known Hong–Ou–Mandel (HOM) interference of two identical single photons36is a special case of this scenario. Here a pair of indistinguishable photons incident upon different input ports of a 50%–50% beam splitter interfere such that both photons always exit from the same output port. In general, the average parity measured in the many-body bosonic interference on a beam splitter probes the quantum state overlap (Supplementary Information) between the two copies, 〈Pi〉 = Tr(ρ1ρ2), whereρ1andρ2are the density matrices of the two copies respectively and 〈...〉 denotes averaging over repeated experimental realizations, as shown inFig. 2b. Hence, for two identical systems, that is, forρ1=ρ2=ρ, the average parity for both output ports (i= 1, 2) equals the quantum purity of the many-body state15,26,27:Equation (3) represents the most important theoretical foundation behind this work—it connects a quantity depending on quantum coherences in the system to a simple observable in the number of particles. It holds even without fixed particle number, as long as there is no definite phase relationship between the copies (Supplementary Information). From equations (1) and (3), detecting entanglement in an experiment is thus reduced to simply measuring the average particle number parity in the output ports of the multi-mode beam splitter.
We probe entanglement formation in a system of interacting87Rb atoms on a one-dimensional optical lattice with a lattice constant of 680 nm. The dynamics of atoms in the lattice is described by the Bose–Hubbard Hamiltonian:whereandare the bosonic creation, annihilation, and the number operators at sitei, respectively. The atoms tunnel between neighbouring lattice sites (indicated by 〈i,j〉) with a rateJand experience an onsite repulsive interaction energyU. Planck’s constanthis set to 1 and hence bothJandUare expressed in hertz. The dimensionless parameterU/Jis controlled by the depth of the optical lattice. Additionally, we can superimpose an arbitrary optical potential with the resolution of a single lattice site by using a spatial light modulator as an amplitude hologram through a high-resolution microscope (Supplementary Information). This microscope also allows us to image the number parity of each lattice site independently28.
To initialize two independent and identical copies of a state with fixed particle numberN, we start with a low-entropy two-dimensional Mott insulator with unity filling in the atomic limit28and deterministically retain a plaquette of 2 ×Natoms while removing all others (Supplementary Information). This is illustrated inFig. 3a. The plaquette of 2 ×Natoms contains two copies (along theydirection) of anN-atom one-dimensional system (along thexdirection), withN= 4 in this figure. The desired quantum state is prepared by manipulating the depth of the optical lattice alongx, varying the parameterU/Jx, whereJxis the tunnelling rate alongx. A box potential created by the spatial light modulator is superimposed onto this optical lattice to constrain the dynamics to the sites within each copy. During the state preparation, a deep lattice barrier separates the two copies and makes them independent of each other.
a, A high-resolution microscope is used to directly image the number parity of ultracold bosonic atoms on each lattice site (in the raw images, green represents odd and black represents even). Two adjacent one-dimensional lattices are created by combining an optical lattice and potentials created by a spatial light modulator. We initialize two identical many-body states by filling the potentials from a low-entropy two-dimensional Mott insulator. The tunnelling ratesJxandJycan be tuned independently by changing the depth of the potential.
b, The atomic beam splitter operation is realized in a tunnel-coupled double-well potential. An atom, initially localized in one of the wells, delocalizes with equal probability into both the wells by this beam splitter. Here, we show the atomic analogue of the HOM interference of two states. The joint probability P(1, 1) measures the probability of coincidence detection of the atoms in separate wells as a function of normalized tunnel timeJyt, with the single particle tunnellingJy= 193(4) Hz. At the beam splitter duration (Jyt= 1/8) bosonic interference leads to a nearly vanishing P(1, 1), corresponding to an even parity in the output states. This can be interpreted as a measurement of the purity of the initial Fock state, here measured to be 0.90(4). The data shown here are averaged over two independent double wells. The blue curve is a maximum-likelihood fit to the data, and the error bars reflect 1σstatistical error.
c, When two copies of a product state, such as the Mott insulator in the atomic limit, are interfered on the beam splitter, the output states contain even particle numbers globally (full system) as well as locally (subsystem), indicating pure states in both.
d, On the other hand, for two copies of an entangled state, such as a superfluid state, the output states contain even particle numbers globally (pure state) but a mixture of odd and even outcomes locally (mixed state). This directly demonstrates entanglement.
PowerPoint slideThe beam splitter operation required for the many-body interference is realized in a double-well potential alongy. The dynamics of atoms in the double well is likewise described by the Bose–Hubbard Hamiltonian, equation (4). A single atom, initially localized in one well, coherently oscillates between the wells with a Rabi frequency ofJ=Jy(oscillation frequency in the amplitude). At discrete times during this evolution,, withn= 1, 2,..., the atom is delocalized equally over the two wells with a fixed phase relationship. Each of these times realizes a beam splitter operation, for which the same two wells serve as the input ports at timet= 0 and output ports at time. Two indistinguishable atoms with negligible interaction strength (U/Jy« 1) in this double well will interfere as they tunnel. The dynamics of two atoms in the double well is demonstrated inFig. 3bin terms of the joint probability P(1, 1) of finding them in separate wells versus the normalized timeJyt. The joint probability P(1, 1) oscillates at a frequency of 772(16) Hz = 4Jy, with a contrast of 95(3)%. At the beam splitter times,, P(1, 1) ≈ 0. The first beam splitter time,is used for all the following experiments, with P(1, 1) = 0.05(2). This is a signature of bosonic interference of two indistinguishable particles37,38, akin to the photonic HOM interference36. This high interference contrast indicates the near-perfect suppression of classical noise and fluctuations and includes an expected 0.6% reduction due to finite interaction strength (U/Jy≈ 0.3). The results from this interference can be interpreted as a measurement of the quantum purity of the initial Fock state as measured from the average parity (equation (3)), 〈Pi〉 = 1 − 2 × P(1, 1) = 0.90(4), wherei= 1, 2 are the two copies.
Entanglement in the ground stateThe Bose–Hubbard model provides an interesting system in which to investigate entanglement. In optical lattice systems, a lower bound of the spatial entanglement has been previously estimated from time-of-flight measurements39and entanglement dynamics in spin degrees of freedom has been investigated with partial state reconstruction40. Here, we directly measure entanglement in real space occupational particle number in a site-resolved way. In the strongly interacting atomic limit ofU/Jx» 1, the ground state is a Mott insulator corresponding to a Fock state of one atom at each lattice site. The quantum state has no spatial entanglement with respect to any partitioning in this phase—it is in a product state of the Fock states. As the interaction strength is reduced adiabatically, atoms begin to tunnel across the lattice sites, and ultimately the Mott insulator melts into a superfluid with a fixed atom number. The delocalization of atoms creates entanglement between spatial subsystems. This entanglement originates41,42from correlated fluctuations in the number of particles between the subsystems due to the super-selection rule that the total particle number in the full system is fixed, as well as coherence between various configurations without any such fluctuation.
To probe the emergence of entanglement, we first prepare the ground state of equation (4) in both copies by adiabatically lowering the optical lattice potential alongx. Then we freeze the tunnelling alongxwithout destroying the coherence in the many-body state and apply the beam splitter alongy. Finally, we rapidly turn on a very deep two-dimensional lattice to suppress all tunnelling and detect the atom number parity (even = 1, odd = −1) at each site. We construct the parity of a spatial region by multiplying the parities of all the sites within that region. The average parity over repeated realizations measures the quantum purity, both globally and locally, according to equation (3), enabling us to determine the second-order Rényi entropy globally and for all possible subsystems.
In the atomic Mott insulator limit (Fig. 3c), the state is separable. Hence, the interference signal between two copies should show even parity in all subsystems, indicating a pure state with zero entanglement entropy. Towards the superfluid regime (Fig. 3d), the build-up of entanglement between various lattice sites leads to mixed states in subsystems, corresponding to a finite entanglement entropy. Hence, the measurement outcomes do not have a pre-determined parity. Remarkably, the outcomes should still retain even global parity, indicating a pure global state. Higher entropy in the subsystems than the global system cannot be explained classically and demonstrates bipartite entanglement.
Experimentally, we find exactly this behaviour for our two 4-site Bose–Hubbard systems (Fig. 4). We observe the emergence of spatial entanglement as the initial atomic Mott insulator melts into a superfluid. The measured quantum purity of the full system is about 0.6 across the Mott insulator to superfluid crossover, corresponding to a Rényi entropy ofS2(AB) ≈ 0.5. The measured purity deep in the superfluid phase is slightly reduced, probably owing to the reduced beam splitter fidelity in the presence of increased single-site occupation number, and any residual heating. The nearly constant global purity indicates a high level of coherence throughout the crossover. For lower interaction strengthU/Jx(superfluid regime), we observe that the subsystem Rényi entropy is higher than the full system:S2(A) >S2(AB). This demonstrates the presence of spatial entanglement in the superfluid state. In the Mott insulator regime (U/Jx» 1),S2(A) is lower thanS2(AB) and proportional to the subsystem size, consistent with a product state.
We study the transition from Mott insulator to superfluid with four atoms on four lattice sites in the ground state of the Bose–Hubbard model, equation (4).
a. As the interaction strengthU/Jxis adiabatically reduced, the purity of the subsystemA(green and blue, inset), Tr(ρA2), becomes less than that of the full system (red). This demonstrates entanglement in the superfluid phase, generated by coherent tunnelling of bosons across lattice sites. In terms of the second-order Rényi entanglement entropy,, the full system has less entropy than its subsystems in this state. In the Mott insulator phase (U/Jx» 1) the full system has more Rényi entropy (and less purity) than the subsystems, owing to the lack of sufficient entanglement and a contribution of classical entropy. The circles are data points and the solid lines are theoretical, calculated from exact diagonalization. The only free parameter is an added offset, assumed to be proportional to the system size and consistent with the average measured entropy (about 0.5) in the full system. The vertical error bars in this figure and inFigs 5and6indicate 1σin combined statistical and systematic errors (Supplementary Information).
b, Second-order Rényi entropy of all possible bi-partitioning of the system. For smallU/Jx, all subsystems (data points connected by green and blue lines) have more entropy than the full system (red circles), indicating full multipartite entanglement43between the four lattice sites. The residual entropy in the Mott insulating regime is from classical entropy in the experiment, and extensive in the subsystem size. The right-hand panel inbshows the values of all Renyi entropies of the particular case ofU/Jx≈ 1, to demonstrate spatial multipartite entanglement in this superfluid.
PowerPoint slideIn these measurements, we post-select outcomes of the experiment for which the total number of atoms detected in both copies is even. This constitutes about 60% of all the data, and excludes realizations with preparation errors, atom loss during the sequence, or detection errors (Supplementary Information). The measured purity is consistent with an imperfect beam splitter operation alone, suggesting much higher purity for the many-body state. The measured entropy is thus a sum of an extensive classical entropy due to the imperfections of the beam splitter and any entanglement entropy.
Our site-resolved measurement simultaneously provides information about all possible spatial partitionings of the system. Comparing the purity of all subsystems with that of the full system enables us to determine whether a quantum state has genuine spatial multipartite entanglement, in which every site is entangled with each other. Experimentally, we find that this is indeed the case for smallU/Jx(Fig. 4b). In the superfluid phase, all possible subsystems have more entropy than the full system, demonstrating full spatial multipartite entanglement between all four sites27,43. In the Mott phase (U/Jx» 1), the measured entropy is dominated by extensive classical entropy, showing a lack of entanglement.
By measuring the second-order Rényi entropy we can calculate other useful quantities, such as the associated mutual informationIAB=S2(A) +S2(B) −S2(AB). Mutual information exhibits interesting scaling properties with respect to the subsystem size, which can be key to studying area laws in interacting quantum systems44. In some cases, such as in ‘data hiding states’45, mutual information is more informative than the more conventional two-point correlators, which might take arbitrarily small values in presence of strong correlations. Mutual information is also immune to extensive classical entropy, and hence has practical utility in the experimental study of larger systems. In our experiments (Fig. 5a), we find that for the Mott insulator state (U/Jx» 1), the entropy of the full system is the sum of the entropies for the subsystems. The mutual information isIAB≈ 0 for this state, consistent with a product state in the presence of extensive classical entropy. AtU/Jx≈ 10, correlations between the subsystems begin to grow as the system adiabatically melts into a superfluid, resulting in non-zero mutual information,IAB> 0.
Any contribution from the extensive classical entropy in our measured Rènyi entropy can be factored out by constructing the mutual informationIAB=S2(A) +S2(B) −S2(AB).
a, We plot the summed entropyS2(A) +S2(B) (in blue, green and light blue corresponding to the partitions shown) and the entropy of the full systemS2(AB) (in red) separately. Mutual information is the difference between the two, as shown by the arrow for a partitioning scheme. In the Mott insulator phase (U/Jx» 1) the sites are not correlated, andIAB≈ 0. Correlations start to build up for smallerU/Jx, resulting in a non-zero mutual information. The theory curves are from exact diagonalization, with added offsets consistent with the extensive entropy in the Mott insulator phase (about 0.5 for the full system).
b, Classical and entanglement entropies follow qualitatively different scaling laws in a many-body system. The top panel inbshows that in the Mott insulator phase classical entropy dominates andS2(A) andS2(B) follow a volume law: entropy increases with the size of the subsystem. The mutual informationIAB≈ 0. The bottom panel inbshows the non-monotonic behaviour ofS2(A) andS2(B) in the superfluid regime, due to the dominance of entanglement over classical entropy, which makes the curves asymmetric.
IABrestores the symmetry by removing the classical uncorrelated noise. The solid lines are linear (top) and quadratic (bottom) fits included as a guide to the eye. The top panel incshows that more correlations are affected (red arrow) with increasing boundary area, leading to a growth of mutual information between subsystems. The data points are for various partitioning schemes shown inFig. 4b. The bottom panel incplotsIABas a function of the distancedbetween the subsystems to show the onset and spread of correlations in space, as the Mott insulator adiabatically melts into a superfluid. In these plots some overlapping data points are offset from each other horizontally for clarity.
PowerPoint slideIt is instructive to investigate the scaling of Rényi entropy and mutual information with subsystem size7,44, since in larger systems they can characterize quantum phases, for example by measuring the central charge of the underlying quantum field theory5.
Figure 5bshows these quantities versus the subsystem size for various partitioning schemes with a single boundary. For the atomic Mott insulator the Rényi entropy increases linearly with the subsystem size and the mutual information is zero, consistent with both a product state and classical entropy being uncorrelated between various sites. In the superfluid state the measured Rényi entropy curves are asymmetric and first increase with the system size, then fall again as the subsystem size approaches that of the full system. This represents the combination of entanglement entropy and the linear classical entropy. The non-monotonicity is a signature of the entanglement entropy, as the entropy for a pure state must vanish when the subsystem size is zero or the full system. The asymmetry due to classical entropy is absent in the mutual information.
The mutual information between two subsystems comes from the correlations across their separating boundary. For a 4-site system, the boundary size ranges from one to three for various partitioning schemes. Among those schemes with a single boundary, maximum mutual information in the superfluid is obtained when the boundary divides the system symmetrically (Fig. 5a). Increasing the boundary size increases the mutual information, as more correlations are interrupted by the partitioning (Fig. 5c).
Mutual information also elucidates the onset of correlations between various sites as the few-body system crosses over from a Mott insulator to a superfluid phase. In the Mott insulator phase (U/Jx» 1) the mutual information between all sites vanish (Fig. 5c, bottom). As the particles start to tunnel, only the nearest-neighbour correlations start to build up (U/Jx≈ 12) and the long-range correlations remain negligible. Further into the superfluid phase, the correlations extend beyond the nearest neighbour and become long range for smallerU/Jx. These results suggest disparate spatial behaviour of the mutual information in the ground state of an uncorrelated (Mott insulator) and a strongly correlated phase (superfluid). For larger systems this can be exploited to identify quantum phases and the onset of quantum phase transitions.
Non-equilibrium entanglement dynamicsAway from the ground state, the non-equilibrium dynamics of a quantum many-body system is often theoretically intractable. This is due to the growth of entanglement beyond the access of numerical techniques, such as the time-dependent density matrix renormalization group theory46,47. Experimental investigation of entanglement may shed valuable light onto non-equilibrium quantum dynamics. Towards this goal, we study a simple system: two particles oscillating in a double well37,48. The non-equilibrium dynamics are described by the Bose–Hubbard model. The quantum state of the system oscillates between unentangled (particles localized in separate wells) states and entangled states in the Hilbert space spanned by |1, 1〉, |2, 0〉 and |0, 2〉. Here, |m,n〉 denotes a state withmandnatoms in the two subsystems (wells), respectively. Starting from the product state |1, 1〉 the system evolves through the maximally entangled states |2, 0〉 + |0, 2〉 ± |1, 1〉 and the symmetric, HOM-like state |2, 0〉 + |0, 2〉. In the maximally entangled states the subsystems are completely mixed, with a probability of 1/3 of having zero, one or two particles. The system then returns to the initial product state |1, 1〉 before re-entangling. In our experiment, we start with a Mott insulating state (U/Jx» 1), and suddenly quench the interaction parameter to a low value,U/Jx≈ 0.3. The non-equilibrium dynamics is demonstrated (Fig. 6) by the oscillation in the second-order Rényi entropy of the subsystem, while the full system assumes a constant value originating from classical entropy. This experiment also demonstrates entanglement in HOM-like interference of two massive particles.
Entanglement dynamics of two atoms in two sites after a sudden quench of the Hamiltonian from a large value ofU/JxtoU/Jx≈ 0.3, withJx≈ 210 Hz. Here, ‘evolution time’ refers to the duration that the atoms spend in the shallow double well, after the initial sudden quench. The system oscillates between Mott insulator (I) and quenched superfluid regimes (II, III). The growth of bipartite entanglement in the superfluid regime is seen by comparing the measured Rényi entropy of the single site subsystem (blue data points) to that of the two site full system (red data points). The solid lines are the theoretical curves, with vertical offsets to include the classical entropy introduced by experimental imperfections.
PowerPoint slideSummary and outlookIn this work, we perform a direct measurement of quantum purity, the second-order Rényi entanglement entropy, and mutual information in a Bose–Hubbard system. Our measurement scheme does not rely on full density matrix reconstruction or the use of specialized witness operators to detect entanglement. Instead, by preparing and interfering two identical copies of a many-body quantum state, we probe entanglement with the measurement of only a single operator. Our experiments represent an important demonstration of the usefulness of the many-body interference for the measurement of entanglement. It is straightforward to extend the scheme to fermionic systems49and systems with internal degrees of freedom27, and to two dimensions. By generalizing the interference toncopies of the quantum state29, arbitrary observables written as annth-order polynomial function of the density matrix—for example, Rényi entropies of ordern> 2—can be measured.
With modest technical upgrades to suppress classical fluctuations and residual interactions, it should be possible to further improve the beam splitter fidelity, enabling us to work with much larger systems. Mutual information may be ideal for exploring larger systems as it is insensitive to any residual extensive classical entropy. For high entropy of a subsystem, corresponding to low state purity, the number of measurements required to reach a desired precision is high. However, in contrast to tomographic methods, this scheme would not require additional operations for larger systems. Moreover, the single-site resolution of the microscope allows us to simultaneously obtain information about all possible subsystems, to probe multipartite entanglement.
For non-equilibrium systems, entanglement entropy can grow in time (indefinitely in infinite systems). This leads to interesting many-body physics, such as thermalization in closed quantum systems50. The long duration of growth of entanglement entropy is considered to be a key signature of many-body localized states14arising in the presence of disorder. The ability to measure the quantum purity for these systems would allow experimental distinction of quantum fluctuations and classical statistical fluctuations.
More generally, by starting with two different quantum states in the two copies this scheme can be applied to measure the quantum state overlap between them. This would provide valuable information about the underlying quantum state. For example, the many-body ground state is very sensitive to perturbations near a quantum critical point. Hence, the overlap between two ground states with slightly different parameters (such asU/Jin the Bose–Hubbard Hamiltonian) could be used as a sensitive probe of quantum criticality51. Similarly the overlap of two copies undergoing non-equilibrium evolution under different perturbations can be used to probe temporal correlation functions in non-equilibrium quantum dynamics.

Editorial SummaryGetting to grips with entanglementAlthough entanglement — in which physically separate particles can behave and can be completely specified as one — is arguably the most important measure of the quantumness of a system. However, it is difficult to measure entanglement directly. Most schemes suggested so far measure it in artificial quantum systems, like ultracold quantum gases, which require reconstruction of the quantum states via tomography and are restricted to localized systems. Here the authors find a way to directly access entanglement in a delocalized, itinerant system. After preparing two identical copies of a many-body quantum state composed of rubidium atoms, the authors let these copies interfere. With a special quantum gas microscope, properties directly connected to entanglement entropy, a characteristic measure of the entanglement of the system, can be observed. This new way of measuring entanglement entropy might allow for other properties connected to entanglement and entanglement entropy to become accessible.
