21 April 2011Cladding on the south faceSuccessive layers of cladding are applied to the exterior of the Winding Facility in April 2011. These include an inner layer of sheeting containing small holes to absorb work area noise; two layers of glass wool insulation; and finally two layers of metal sheeting sealed with tape against dust. The final colours will be grey and burnished red.
21 April 2011Seen from the skyThe poloidal field coil system consists of six horizontal coils placed outside the toroidal magnet structure. Due to their size, the actual winding of five of the six poloidal field coils will take place here, in this dedicated, 257-metre long facility on the ITER site in Cadarache. (The smallest of the coils will be manufactured offsite and delivered finished.) Photo: F4E17 April 2011The Winding Facility in AprilSeen from above: the Poloidal Field Coils Winding Facility.
