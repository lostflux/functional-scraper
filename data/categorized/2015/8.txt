Photo: F4E 14 January 2011 Download And now, on to the roof The metal trusses for the roof of the Poloidal Field Coils Winding Facility weigh eight tons each. Due to their weight, the metal parts are first assembled on the building's reinforced concrete slab, then lifted by crane to a height of 19 metres.

The wide openings visible on the west face of the building are the exit doors for the completed coils; each door is 30 metres wide.

These columns will support the structure of the building and bear the weight of two travelling bridge cranes that will have a lifting capacity, respectfully, of 25 and 100 tonnes.

The French consortium Spie Batignolles, Omega Concept and Setec was chosen by the European Domestic Agency F4E to design and build the facility.

Later 2012, the winding and assembly activities for ITER's five largest poloidal field coils will begin in this 257-metre, on-site facility. Image credit: ITER Organization Download The largest components The poloidal field coils completely encircle the ITER vacuum vessel and toroidal field magnet system. These giant components areâ€”for five of them, at leastâ€”too large to travel after manufacture.
