02 February 2015Extension completedThe 35-metre extension to the Headquarters building is completed in September 2014. Following its official handover to the ITER Organization (on 30 September) work can now begin to carry out the necessary arrangements for move-in (furnishings, IT connections).
17 September 2014ContinuityAs contruction progress has now reached level 5, the ITER Headquarters extension now stands in perfect continuity with the main building.
02 June 2014Headquarters extension risesWorkers progress in April on the fourth storey of the ITER Headquarters extension. When completed this summer, an extra 350 desks will be available to staff or contractors.

Incorporating steel fibres, this self-compacting concrete has exceptional durability and extremely high compression resistance: between 130 and 250 MPa (Mega Pascal) in normal conditions. The high resistance is accompanied by a very high density and almost zero permeability of water, oxygen or chloride ion diffusion.
