The First Order was ruled by aSupreme Leaderfrom theirmobileheadquartersinstead of a traditionalplanetarycapital. The First Order had a fanatical devotion to the totalitarian notions of order and a violent disdain for the New Republic anddemocracy. As the newly established Republicconsolidatedits influence and theGalactic Empirewas reduced to several successor states,formerImperial officers,nobles, technologists, andwarlordshowever escaped to theUnknown Regionsas part of a secretContingencydevised byGalactic EmperorSheev Palpatine, claiming the status as a successor of the Old Empire. There, they plotted a return to power and sought to reclaim the lost Imperial legacy.
The first set of leaders of the First Order wereGrand AdmiralRae SloaneandGeneralBrendol Hux. Though Sloane was seen as a potential candidate to lead the First Order, she was supplanted by Supreme LeaderSnokeand a new generation of young zealousofficers. Much of the First Order was unaware of the Contingency itself nor their ultimate purpose in it. The Order was further unaware of Snoke's trueorigins, though some came to realize that he was subservient to someunseen force. A number of planets affiliated with theCentrists, a bloc of theNew Republic Senate, left the New Republic after aseries of tumultous eventsin order to join the First Order, providing it with a foothold in the widergalaxy. This marked the First Order's public formation as apoliticalcoalition of worlds advocating centralized authority, though the Order had originally been formed in the Unknown Regions, precipitating the return of themilitaristicdictatorshipthat had existed under the Old Empire. Due to this hostility,SenatorLeia Organafounded theResistanceand split from the Republic to monitor the activities of the Order due to the Senate being unwilling to take external threats seriously.
Consequently, aCold Warbegan with the New Republic in which there was no direct, large-scale fighting, but there was instead occasional minor skirmishes and incidents. The First Order had also begun to annexstar systemsin theOuter Rim Territorieswith ease. Under Snoke, the First Order launched a militarization program and developed atechnologically superior militarywithResurgent-class Star Destroyersand anew generation of stormtroopers. The First Order subverted the Republic by illegally building military installations, shipyards, weapons research facilities, and amysterious project. Despite increasing First Order aggression, the New Republic refused to take forcefulmilitaryaction against the Order, for they believed that the First Order posed no real, credible threat to the galaxy at large.
Five yearslater, the First Orderconductedapreemptive strikeon the New Republic, using Starkiller Base to destroy the capital-world ofHosnian Primebefore commencing anmassive invasionof the galaxy. Though itssuperweaponwasdestroyedby the Resistance, itsarmiesandfleetsvastly outnumbered the Resistance. Snoke wasassassinatedby his apprentice,Kylo Ren, who seized control as Supreme Leader and conquered vast regions and installed a reign of galactic terror. Ren also prioritized the destruction of the Resistance, hunting its remnants across the galaxy. Despite their conquest of the major star systems, butmilitaryrule was met with defiance and rebellion. Ayear later, amysterious transmissionbroadcasting a voice of Palpatine—the long-deadEmperorDarthSidious. Determined to uncover the truth to prevent any threats to his rule, Ren diverted resources away from ongoing rebellions across the galaxy. Ren found afindthe source atExegoland discovered arevivedDarthSidious and hiscult, that sought the recreation of theSith Empire. Sidious told Ren he had been overseeing the First Order behind a veil of secrecy, and that Snoke had been anartificialgenetic construct to rule the First Order as a proxy and offered hisfleetto the First Order if Ren killed theJediPadawanRey.
However, Renrenouncedthedark side of the Force, returning to thelight sideas Ben Solo. Command of the First Order was assumed byAllegiant GeneralEnric Prydein the absence of a Supreme Leader. Pryde swore his allegiance to the Emperor, and was given command of the Sith fleet. However, the Emperor's plans were undone during theBattle of Exegol; reinforced by aCitizens' Fleet, theResistance navydestroyed the Final Order, preventing the Sithwarshipsfrom leaving Exegol. In the aftermath of Exegol, anuprising against the First Ordererupted on many worlds across the galaxy, causing the First Order's hold over the galaxy to crumble.
ContentsHistory[]Rise and fall of Empire[]The Emperor's death triggered the Contingency, a plan to destroy the Empire and rebuild it in the Unknown Regions.
For roughly amillennium, theGalactic Republicmaintained peace and stability withinthe galaxy, aided by the efforts of the monasticJedi Orderand theJudicial Forces. With the believed extinction of theSith—ancient enemies of theJediand the Republic—the rulingDark LordDarth Sidioussecretly plotted to overthrow the Republic with the formation of his ownSith Empire.
[22][23]Sidious, along with hisSith apprenticeDarth Tyranus, orchestrated theSeparatist Crisisby fomenting political chaos across thegalaxy. Through his apprentice, Sidious secretly commanded a rival galactic government known as theConfederacy of Independent Systemsthroughout the destructive three-yearperiodthat was theClone Wars, while he remained theSupreme Chancellorof the Republic as Sheev[24]Palpatine long beyond the expiration of his term. Gradually amassing far more emergency powers than would be ordinarily allowed through theGalactic Senate, along with radically amending theGalactic Constitution, Sidious eventually oversaw thedestructionof the Jedi Order and thedefeatof the Separatists through his new apprentice,Darth Vader. Sidious, as Chancellor Palpatine, then issued theproclamation of the New Order,[24]officially transforming the thousand-year-olddemocracyinto theGalactic Empireand installing himself as the firstGalactic Emperorwith the support of the Senate.
[25]With thepurgeof the Jedi and a massive military to enforce his will, Sidious remained largely unchallenged asEmperorthroughout the initial nineteen years of hisreign, embarking on a gradual conquest of the galaxy. Eventually, theAlliance to Restore the Republicwas formed to oppose his aggressive expansion and genocidal actions,[26]resulting in the outbreak of theGalactic Civil War[27]that spanned five years ofgalactic history.
[source?]Four years after thedestructionof thefirst Death StarbyLuke Skywalker,[27]the Empire suffered a decisive defeat at theBattle of Endor, where the more powerfulDeath Star IIwas destroyed, and along with it, the Emperor and his apprentice,DarthVader.
[28]The Emperor posthumously decreed the destruction of the Galactic Empire as a failed state.
Unknown to anyone but a select few, however, the Emperor had long been sending Imperialscoutsand other constructive efforts to theUnknown Regionsofspace. Over the course of decades, the Unknown Regions had been seeded with shipyards, laboratories, and storehouses that would serve to prepare for the Empire's rebirth as part of Sidious'Contingencyin the rare event of hisdeath.
[29]His plan was to ensure the Galactic Empire's destruction as he believed that an Empire should not outlive its Emperor.
[30]However, he also planned the creation of a new Empire beyond the borders of known space; resources and select personnel were discreetly funneled to the Unknown Regions, where the Empire could begin anew.
[29]Sidious entrusted the task of executing the Contingency to his protégé,Gallius Rax.
[30]Following another year of bloody conflict, the fractured Empire made its last stand over the sandy wastes ofJakku, which had become a rallying point for retreating Imperials, against theNew Republic, resulting in many casualties on both sides of the conflict[10]as part of theBattle of Jakku.
[31]On Jakku, a secret Imperial research base,[10]theJakku Observatory, housed ancientcomputerswhich plotted out computerized routes through the Unknown Regions. These computers used information derived fromGrand AdmiralThrawn,[30]who hailed from theChiss Ascendancy,[32]and the survey teams andprobe droidsthat the Emperor had previously sent to explore these routes.
[30]Jakku came to serve as a jumping-off point for Imperialwarshipsheading into the Unknown Regions,[33]and the retreating Imperials destroyed the research base before the New Republic could reach it.
[10]Defeated at the Battle of Jakku, the Empire sued for peace with the New Republic.
As part of the Contingency, Rax's secret objective in the Battle of Jakku was to destroy the planet to cripple both the remnants of the Empire and the New Republic; however, he was prevented from carrying out this phase by GrandAdmiralRae Sloane, who killed Rax. In his dying words, Rax urged Sloane to take his place in the Contingency withCommandantBrendol Hux, his sonArmitage Hux, and theirchild soldiersaboard thestarshipImperialisand rendezvous with the Emperor's flagship, theSuper Star DestroyerEclipse, which had been dispatched in advance to the Unknown Regions. Their journey took several months and consisted of many shorthyperspacejumps, during which time Sloane discovered that theImperialishad been transmitting coordinates to other Imperialfleets. Upon regrouping with theEclipse, Sloane ordered theSentinelpiloting theImperialisto bring the ship in and rejoin with the others. There, she intended to board and saw an opportunity to rebuild the Empire; one that was stronger and purer, and not given to the backstabbing and incest of the Galactic Empire.
[30]Defeated at Jakku and facing severe internal unrest, the Empire was forced to sign theGalactic Concordance, severely limiting its ability to wage war and ushering in its transformation into a mere rump state.
[10]ImperialGrand VizierMas Ameddaand New RepublicChancellorMon Mothmasigned the Galactic Concordance, which called for the dissolution of the Galactic Empire. Chancellor Mothma then issued another declaration designating all survivingImperial officersas war criminals,[30]while the Empire began to break into remnants. Aremnantof Imperial vessels was confined to predetermined boundaries by the New Republic in theCoreandInner Rim[31]while aprovisional governmentled by Amedda was established onCoruscant, the formercapitalof the Old Republic[22]and throneworld of the Empire, where it was overseen by Republic observers.
[30]After the signing of the Galactic Concordance, the New Republic arrived in systems still under Imperial control to announce the signing of the historic peace treaty. However, by the time the Republic reached these systems, Imperial fleets had already retreated to the Unknown Regions. The battle's end at Jakku was marked by the sudden departure of the surviving Imperial warships into the Unknown Regions following the announcement of the treaty, where they had seemingly disappeared.
[10]Early foundations[]Remnants of the Old Empire endured through the New Republic Era, gradually reuniting as the First Order.
Following the Battle of Jakku,[30]former Imperialofficers,nobles,technologists,[34]andwarlords[10]fled the Empire into the galaxy's Unknown Regions in an effort to escape the prying eyes of the New Republic[30]as part of anexodus.
[10]There, they plotted a return to power, beginning to build fleets andarmiesin secret to reclaim the Imperial legacy.
[34]The Old Empire gradually withered away into aremnantof political hardliners locked in a cold war with the New Republic before breaking away into the Unknown Regions, where they reformed into[10]what became[34]the mysterious First Order,[10]a military junta[3]influenced by the principles of the fallen Empire.
[35]Sloane and Hux became part of a first set of leaders of the First Order.
[7]The First Order was formed from thepolitical, military, and spiritual[11]elements of theNew Order,[9]and as such, its origins dated back to the Galactic Empire.
[11]TheCentrists' secession from the New Republic marked the First Order's public formation[9]as a political coalition of worlds advocating centralized authority, while the remnants of theImperial Militaryformed the basis of theFirst Order military. TheSith Eternalwas the First Order's secretive spiritual branch;[11]as aSith cult, they preserved the Sithreligionand revered thedark side of the Forcefrom their base of operations on theplanetExegol. Additionally, the Sith Eternalcultistswere dedicated to the restoration of the Empire, secretly working to ensure the First Order's conquest of the galaxy.
[9]The rise of Snoke[]The First Order fell under the control of Supreme Leader Snoke, a strandcast created by Darth Sidious.
Just as many of the Emperor's servants carried the Old Empire's greatest military secrets to the Unknown Regions, so too did the creature known asSnoke, who rose to become[29]theSupreme Leaderof the First Order.
[4]Had it not been for the ancienthyperspace trailsblazed through the Unknown Regions by Snoke'sAttendants, most of the former Imperial officers would have likely perished crossing into the uncharted realm.
[14]Snoke was a mysterious humanoid, with very scant details as to regarding his origins,[11]strong with the dark side of the Force.
[14]Despite his abilities not being explicitly Sith in origin, Snoke's powerful abilities as a force user and knowledge made him the undisputed heir as the leader to the forces gathered under the Contingency.
[9]Snoke was, in fact, one of the manyartificialstrandcastscreatedby the Emperor and his cult following, the Sith Eternal, prior to his demise, and discarded as a potential vessel for the Sith Lord's dark essence.
[21]Instead, Snoke was made to serve as a proxy ruler for his creator and influenced by the zombified Sith Lord from afar[11]to gather the forces that would go to make the armies of the First Order and spread his influence across the galaxy through less direct means.
[21]The First Order did not know of Snoke's origins, though some came to peer behind the veil of secrecy and realized that he was subservient to some unseen force.
[9]Snoke himself was possibly unaware of the factual nature surrounding his existence.
[11]Darth Sidious secretly guided the development of the First Order through his manipulation of Snoke.
The Emperor's resurrection, the existence of his followers, the Sith Eternal, and their hidden base of operations, Exegol, were all secrets unknown to even the highest echelons of the First Order. Much of the First Order was even unaware of the Contingency itself nor their ultimate purpose in it, for as the First Order served as its military wing, the Sith Eternal lay at its spiritual heart. The true leadership of the First Order operated from behind a veil of secrecy, driven by the tenets of the dark side ofthe Forceand the ancient ways of the Sith.
[9]From afar, the phantom Emperor, working from the shadows,[5]forged the remnants of the Empire into the First Order as he plotted his return to power.
[36]Snoke's choices when governing the faction only added to his mysterious nature. The dark side adept made no designs toward the old title Emperor, relied on mysticism and focusing on spiritual matters while allowing the generals wield the First Order military in his name, and was unwilling to meet in person with his subordinates, instead relying on large casting presence holograms to communicate with and to administer orders to the underlings who served him.
[9]Gallius Rax, Rae Sloane,Ormes Apolin, and Brendol Hux were originally seen as potential leaders of the Empire's remnants by the admirals andgeneralswho had survived the implosion of the Empire and the New Republic's wrath, but they were sidelined, co-opted, or destroyed by Snoke. Brendol's son, General Armitage Hux, was spared in the long term by Snoke in order to use him as a political tool in his rise to power.
[29]The First Order was joined by the grandson of Darth Vader, Kylo Ren, who pledged himself to the teachings of Supreme Leader Snoke.
As the son of a founding member of the First Order, Armitage was raised in the organization's military wing[9]whichCaptainPhasmajoined after leaving her homeworld ofParnassoswith Brendol.
[7]Following theDestruction of the Jedi Temple, formerPadawanBen Solojoined the First Order under the persona of Kylo Ren. He became themasterof theKnights of Renas well as the apprentice of Supreme Leader Snoke. Hailing from the powerful bloodline of theSkywalker family, Ren had in his master's estimation the potential to become as strong as his grandfather Darth Vader.
[12]Unlike Armitage and Phasma, Ren did not possess an official rank in the First Order military. Nonetheless, as Snoke's apprentice he wielded the authority to command his master's forces.
[10]Kylo Ren, General Armitage Hux, and Captain Phasma were members of a new generation of First Order leaders.
Ren, Armitage, and Phasma represented a new generation of leaders that supplanted the old guard in the First Order's command structure.
[9]As part of this turnover, Armitage and Phasma conspired to assassinate Brendol; Armitage had been abused by his father from his youth, while Phasma sought to erase her past. Armitage left the actual murder up to Phasma with his only instruction being to make it untraceable. Phasma carried out the killing of Brendol using the toxin from the bite of aParnassos beetle. Armitage then gave a brief address to CaptainCardinaland theStormtrooper Corpsinforming them of Brendol's passing and ascended to his leadership role in the military, taking over from his late father.
[7]At some point, a cargo ship was ambushed containing military gear which the ship's crew claimed was meant for the First Order. Among the possessions seized was a set ofstormtrooper armorwhich was later presented toTerex, a formerImperial stormtrooperand, at the time, a crime lord of theRanc gang. Terex immediately became curious about the modern design and confirmed that it was not of Imperial design. After Terex asked of its origin, he continued to think about the implications of this new information. Sometime later, he subsequently joined the ranks of theFirst Order Security Bureau.
[37]Meanwhile, the First Order had to contend with several threats that lurked within the Unknown Regions: hermetic kingdoms which were confronted by the Order. On Supreme Leader Snoke's instruction, the new military undertook a major offensive against several of these kingdoms to seize their worlds and resources to fuel their rise.
[29]Phasma herself led from the front as the First Order charted through the wilderness of the Unknown Regions.
[10]Cold War[]The First Order emerges[]The Amaxine warriors were a paramilitary group with secret ties to the First Order.
The First Order sought to restore to weaken the New Republic and to generate funding to build up thenew navy. The First Order had used a militia group called theAmaxine warriorsas proxies to fund theNiktocrime lordRinnrivin Di'scartelto achieve this. Seven years prior to the "Napkin Bombing" at theNew Republic senatorial complexonHosnian Prime, the First Order used the Amaxines to inject billions ofcreditsas start-up capital into Rinnrivin's cartel, turning the hitherto minor cartel into a major crime syndicate. Establishing a mutual relationship with the Amaxines, Rinnrivin embarked on lucrative smuggling and gambling operations with the proceeds being channeled through shadowy corporations and Centrist sources back to the First Order, which used the money to rebuild its fleet. In addition, the Order also recruited several Centrist senators likeLadyCarise Sindianas clandestine agents who worked to subvert the Republic from within. Many Centrists, an informal faction who were the rivals to thePopulistsin theNew Republic Senate, and who favored a greater central government and military, admired the Old Empire's leaders and practices. Another proxy of the First Order wasArliz Hadrassian, a formerTIE fighter pilotwho had become the leader of the Amaxine warriors. While Hadrassian saw the Amaxines as the vanguard of the First Order, Lady Carise regarded her as too volatile to manage. Hadrassian in return was impatient with the Centrists for refusing to secede from the Republic.
[38]Failing to elect a First Senator, the New Republic lost the Centrist bloc to the First Order.
The First Order's operations were almost exposed when Rinnrivin Di's criminal activities began to exact a devastating toll on the planetRyloth's off-world trade. In response, the New Republic senatorsLeia OrganaandRansolm Casterfoembarked on an investigation which uncovered Rinnrivin's links to the Amaxine warriors. However, the two senators failed to discover the Order's linkages to the Amaxines and Rinnrivin's cartel. In an attempt to sow chaos, Arliz Hadrassian bombed the New Republic's senatorial complex. This set in motion a chain of events that led to the death of Rinnrivin and the destruction of most of the Amaxine warriors' forces on the planetSibensko. Hadrassian killed herself afterassassinatingthe Republic senatorTai-Lin Garr. While most Republic senators and the media believed that the demise of Rinnrivin's cartel and the Amaxines eliminated all threats to the Republic, Senator Organa disagreed with the New Republic's complacency. However, she was sidelined from the political process following a political scandal that led to the public revelation that her father was Darth Vader, which discredited Organa and forced her to resign from the Senate.
[38]The First Order claimed legitimacy as a successor state of the former Galactic Empire.
After the assassination of Tai-Lin Garr, Lady Carise and her Centrist counterparts began preparing a motion to secede from the New Republic in order to join and support the First Order.
[38]The Centrists formally withdrew from the New Republic and joined the First Order[9]in29 ABY,[18]marking the official formation of the First Order as a regime and beginning theCold Warbetween the First Order and the New Republic.
[9]While some in the Galactic Senate applauded the notion, others realized that without New Republic supervision, the former Imperials would return to the draconian ways of their predecessors.
[16]Supreme Leader Snoke initiated a vast rearmament program, which would go on to produce a technologically superior military over the one that once existed under the Galactic Empire, and began subverting the Republic, as the First Order was keenly aware that it lacked the superior numbers and support of the former Imperial state.
[29]Preparations for war[]The forces of the First Order emerged from the Unknown Regions, revealing the results of its rearmament program in defiance of the Galactic Concordance.
The Centrist worlds that seceded from the New Republic provided the First Order with a foothold in the known galaxy,[16]by which time its military forces emerged from the Unknown Regions, precipitating the return offascismand militarism.
[9]In defiance of the Galactic Concordance, First Order forces frequently crossed theTrans-Hydian Borderlands, launching several incursions into both Republic space and othersectors.
[40][35][41]The term "cold war" was used because there was no direct, large-scale fighting, but instead occasional minor skirmishes. Despite mounting First Order aggression, the New Republic refused to take forceful military action against the Order, seeking to avoid provoking another devastating galactic war at all costs.
[40]During this time, theResistance, an offshoot of theNew Republic Defense Force, was founded by General Leia Organa, who realized that the Senate could not protect the New Republic, alongside her few remaining allies, likeGial Ackbar,C-3PO,Joph Seastriker, andTemmin Wexley. The Resistance acted as a check on the military designs of the First Order.
[38]General Organa released theGrace Reportto the New Republic Senate, which publicly claimed that the Order was building hidden shipyards, armories, research-and-development labs, and academies, detailing the fact that facilities were working day and night on the massive military buildup.
[35]Meanwhile, the First Order began to expand and took overstar systemswith ease.
[42]The New Republic did not consider the First Order a threat to the galaxy, despite its military buildup.
The New Republic Senate believed that the First Order posed no real, credible threat to the galaxy at large and the hard-won galactic peace. Echoing these sentiments, ChancellorLanever Villechamargued there was no need for concern as long as the Order adhered to the dictates of the Galactic Concordance. Despite this, the First Order blatantly defied the accords by ushering in the mass mobilization of superiorstormtrooperforces, along with violating Republic bans on the sale of weapons to the First Order. Testing the resolve of the New Republic, small skirmishes occasionally erupted between the First Order and Republic, all while the Starkiller operation sought a suitable planet for implementation.
[10]The Resistance was formed as a result of the New Republic's unwillingness to risk open war with the First Order.
With the First Order's growing threat and rapid mobilization for war, prominent members of the Republic voiced concern over the Imperial successor state, with the most vocal being former Senator Leia Organa. Scoffed at by the Senate at large for being an alarmist and warmonger, Organa used her influence as a prominent member of the former Rebel Alliance to recruit many former military officers who had been left forgotten by theMilitary Disarmament Actpassed by the Galactic Senate. Funded by like-minded senators who shared Organa's fears about the First Order, the Resistance came to serve as the opposing force to the Order's growing power, sparking a new phase of the continued Cold War.
[10]Meanwhile, the Republic Senate had become mired in corruption and bureaucracy,[40]amplified by the political gridlock caused by the divide between the Populists and the Centrists.
[38]Some senators likeErudo Ro-Kiintorcolluded with the First Order for promises of wealth and power, with large sums of credits being discreetly transferred to him through theCorporate Sector Authority. As a result, the Resistance was forced to work on its own until it could obtain irrefutable evidence of First Order violations of the peace that could be presented toNew Republic Command. DuringOperation: Sabre Strike,Resistance pilotPoe Dameronand General Organa discovered that Senator Erudo had been colluding with the First Order and that he had valuable information aboutLor San Tekka, whom Organa believed could lead them to her brother, Luke Skywalker, who had gone into self-exile.
[40]The First Order deployed stormtroopers to theColossus, ostensibly to protect the station from piracy.
The First Order began anoccupation of theColossusrefueling station on the planetCastilonas part of their preparations for their planned war against the rest of the galaxy. The First Order occupied theColossusunder the guise ofpeacekeepersin wake of severalpirateraids on the platform, which the Order itself had secretly manufactured as a pretext of intervention so that theColossuscould be used as a staging ground.
[43]The First Order had prior interest on the station; it hadplaceda largebountyof twenty thousand credits onKelandEila, which the Order claimed were members of a high-ranking First Order family from outside its military hierarchy. In actuality, Kel and Eila were orphaned survivors of the First Order's aggressiveactionsagainst the people onTehar.
[13]The First Order's presence was welcomed by some civilians on theColossus, but others opposed the Order's measures, leading to a riot among thealienpopulation.
[43]In response, the First Order targeted residents who opposed or defied their control and placed them under arrest to be sent offworld under the pretext of an interest in security.
[44]The search for the last Jedi[]Captain Phasma ordered Agent Terex to track the Resistance pilot Poe Dameron.
In response to the Resistance's Operation: Sabre Strike, Captain Phasma dispatched Agent Terex to recover the information that Poe Dameron obtained from Senator Erudo. Terex's First Order strike force pursued Dameron and hisBlack Squadronto the planetOvanis.
[20]With the help of the unwilling spy,Oddy Muva,[45]Terex planted a tracker on Dameron'sT-70 X-wing starfighter.
[46]Askirmishtook place on the skies over Ovanis and theCave of the Crèche, which was complicated by the presence of theCrèchecult and the hatching of twowinged creatures. Ultimately, Terex and his landing force were defeated. TheCrèche eldergave the information onLor San Tekkato Dameron. To avoid war between the First Order and the New Republic, Terex and his surviving men were allowed to leave on theirMaxima-A class heavy cruiser.
[47]The First Order and the Resistance sought to find Lor San Tekka, who possessed the key to finding Jedi Master Luke Skywalker.
Terex later obtained intelligence that Black Squadron weretravelingtoMegaloxprisonon the high-gravity world ofMegalox Beta. Dameron traveled to the prison world to question theHuttcrime lordGrakkus Jahibakti Tingiabout his knowledge of San Tekka's whereabouts. Terex bribedWardenLutainto abandoning Black Squadron to the prison population. Though Grakkus had made a deal with Terex to disclose the information, Grakkus changed his mind and decided to sell the information to whoever got him out first.
[48]Incensed at Grakkus' double-cross, Terex hired the crime lordsIsin,Kan Be, andTorento use their gangs to stormGrakkus' fortressand kill Black Squadron. He planned to interrogate Grakkus and then kill him.
[49]Grakkus' plan was, however, foiled by Black Squadron'sastromech droidsincludingBB-8, who deactivated Megalox's gravity shield. While Black Squadron and Grakkus escaped, Terex and his mercenaries were pinned down by the high gravity. Terex managed to escape aboard theCarrion Spikeand attacked theMegalox space station, seeking to punish Luta for letting Black Squadron escape. His ship blasted several shuttles but was forced to retreat when Black Squadron turned around and inflicted considerable damage on theCarrion Spike. Captain Phasma summoned Terex back to First Order space to report for debriefing, but Terex instead chose to pursue his nemesis Dameron.
[50]Dameron was helped by Suralinda Javos, a journalist investigating the First Order's clandestine activities.
Later, theGalaxy Beaconjournalistand former New Republic Starfleet memberSuralinda Javosdiscovered that the First Order was building military installations, shipyards, weapons research facilities, and "something bigger" in violation of the Galactic Concordance. She met with Dameron on the Inner Rim gas giant ofPheryon, hoping to sell the information to the Resistance in order to boost her journalistic career. However, the First Order Security Bureau AgentWeeland his stormtroopers captured Javos and Dameron. During interrogation, Javos managed to kill Weel and free Dameron. After escaping, Javos decided to join the Resistance.
[51]Instead of returning to First Order space, Terex traveled to the crime haven ofKaddak.
[52]There, he retook control of the Ranc gang,[53]which he had helped create after the Battle of Jakku.
[37]Against Captain Phasma's orders, Terex decided to use his Ranc gang to destroy Poe and the Resistance. His plan involved giving false intelligence on the First Order to the Resistancedroid spyN1-ZXand tracking Dameron back to the Resistance base. Terex wanted to destroy the Resistance once and for all to aid the First Order's conquest of the galaxy.
[45]Terex's plans were upended when Dameron realized the deception and led Terex's Ranc gang fleet to aremote desert planet.
[45]In addition, Oddy decided to break Terex's leverage on him by rescuing his wifeSowa Chuanand several slaves from Terex's flagship,Carrion Spike. While Terex led a landing party in pursuit of Dameron and the droids, Black SquadronassailedTerex's ship and armada of "Uglies."[54]Oddy and most of the slaves managed to escape inescape podswhile Black Squadron provided firing cover. Terex's landing party was also wiped out by N1-ZX, who had been reprogrammed withMister Bones's droid personality template. Terex also fought with Dameron and BB-8 but was disarmed following a struggle.
[55]The battle came to an end when First Order forces underCommanderMalarusarrived and wiped out Terex's Ranc gang fleet and flagshipCarrion Spike.
[55]Dameron delivered Terex to Commander Malarus, who arrested the rogue agent for risking open war between the First Order and the Resistance.
Malarus had been dispatched by the First Order to arrest Terex, whose rogue mission violated Supreme Leader Snoke's directive to avoid open conflict with the New Republic and New Republic-aligned forces such as the Resistance. Malarus also led a landing party who met with Dameron and took the captive Terex into custody.
[55]Malarus and Terex then went toAbednedoto capture Oddy Muva.
[56]While onboard a transport, she had Terex interrogate Muva for information on the Resistance.
[57]Malarus however lost Muva with the aid of Dameron and Wexley, Malarus was then forced to watched as Muva made a suicide run on theEnshadoand followed by her escape into hyperspace.
[58]Malarus then went toCato Neimoidiawhere she fought with Dameron. She was confronted by an official ofHouse Reya, who arrested her and said they would give her a trial.
[59]Threatened by the return of the Jedi Order, the Supreme Leader prioritized the hunt for Luke Skywalker.
Seeking to locate a fragment of amapthat led toJedi MasterLuke Skywalker[4]—who had gone into self-imposed exile following the failed resurrection of the Jedi Order, for which he blamed himself[12]—Supreme Leader Snoke believed that if Skywalker were to ever return, the new Jedi would rise, which would threaten the First Order's rise to power.
[4]As a result, the Supreme Leader deployed the Starkiller commanding triumvirate[10]—General Hux, Captain Phasma, and Kylo Ren—to Jakku, where Dameron and BB-8 had recovered thestar mapfragment from Lor San Tekka, an old ally of General Organa. Seeking to capture the droid, the First Orderassaulted[4]theChurch of the Forcesettlement ofTuanul[10]where San Tekka resided, but BB-8 was able to escape with the piece of the map.
[4]At Ren's command, First Order troops massacred a village on Jakku.
The villagers of Tuanul fought back but were defeated; the survivors were then herded into a large group while San Tekka was brought to Ren himself, who demanded he turn over information on the map to the First Order. San Tekka claimed that Ren could not deny the truth that was his own family, causing Ren to slay the old man with hislightsaber. Dameron then fired on Ren in retaliation, but the dark warriorcaughtthe blast while his stormtroopers captured the pilot and brought him to[4]theirflagship, theResurgent-class Star DestroyerFinalizer.
[10]Captain Phasma and her stormtroopers—except forFN-2187—executed the remaining villagers on Ren's orders.
[4]FN-2187 and Dameron escaped theFinalizeraboard a stolenTIE/sf space superiority fighter[60]though not before Ren tortured Dameron and discovered the map fragment to be in aBB-unitdroid back on Jakku. During their escape, Dameron dubbed the renegade stormtrooper Finn. The pair crash landed in theGoazon Badlandson Jakku, where Finn presumed Dameron deceased. Finn eventually found BB-8 alongside ascavengernamedRey, but the First Order also found them, leading them to mark Rey as well and pursue the three across Jakku. However, Rey, Finn, and BB-8 were able to escape Jakku aboard theMillennium Falcon. They eventually stumbled on Rebellion war heroes andsmugglersHan SoloandChewbaccain space, and the five of them traveled toTakodana, where they sought the help ofMaz Kanatain order to deliver BB-8 and the map fragment to General Organa at theResistance base.
[4]On the First Order's secret Starkiller Base, General Hux informed Supreme Leader Snoke that theirsuperweaponwas ready and proposed using it on the New Republic in order to draw out the Resistance. Supreme Leader Snoke authorized the operation and dismissed Hux before he conferred with Kylo Ren, with whom he discussed an apparent awakening in the Force. The Supreme Leader then informed his dark apprentice that the droid had fallen into the hands of his father, Han Solo, before cutting his holographic transmission to Starkiller Base.
[4]First Order/Resistance War[]Starkiller unleashed[]The New Republic was destroyed by Starkiller Base as a demonstration of the First Order's power.
On the very eve of the planned war, General Hux delivered a speech to the legions of stormtroopers under his command who assembled to witness the destructive firepower of the weapon. Hux declared that the day would mark the end of the New Republic and denounced the Republic for lying to the galaxy, claiming that the Republic secretly supported the Resistance.
[4]After proclaiming that the remaining systems would bow to the First Order, General Hux commanded that the weapon be fired, and massive beams of energy were fired across the galaxy fromIlum[9]towards the Hosnian system. When the beams arrived, the astronomical bodies of the system weredestroyed, including the galactic capital of Hosnian Prime, and with it, the New Republic Senate and aportionof itsDefense Fleet.
[4]A division of First Order stormtroopers invaded Takodana to acquire the map to Luke Skywalker.
As the First Order rose to power through theStarkiller crisis, it continued the hunt for the map to Skywalker, seeking to prevent the rise of the new Jedi. Its forces swiftly laidsiegetoMaz Kanata's castleon Takodana and leveled it. Rey fled into the forests surrounding the castle, but Ren deployed stormtroopers to the woods before heading into the woods himself, hunting Rey down and eventually finding and capturing her. He probed her mind with the Force and realized that she had seen the map. Ren then decided that he would not need the droid, believing that he could instead interrogate her to find out what she had seen. Ren was notified of a Resistance surprise attack by a stormtrooper officer, who requested more troops, but Ren instead ordered the First Orderdivisionto pull out, claiming that they had what they came for. First Order troops then boarded their ships and withdrew, taking the unconscious Rey along with them.
[4]The Battle of Starkiller Base ended in the superweapon's destruction.
Aided by the deserter FN-2187 "Finn," Solo and Chewbacca infiltrated Starkiller Base to rescue Rey and disable the planetary shields, allowing a Resistancestriketo destroy the planet-converted superweapon. With the First Order minutes away from destroying the Resistance base onD'Qar, the team achieved their objectives, although Solo died in the process while trying to reconcile with Ren, hissonwith Organa. Escaping the planet with seconds to spare, the First Order's sun-harvesting superweapon was destroyed by theResistance Starfighter Corps, forming a new star where the planet once was. Supreme Leader Snoke ordered General Hux to leave the planet and come to him with Kylo Ren in order to complete his training.
[4]As Starkiller blew up, the damagedRetributionthat was under the command ofGideon Haskpulled out ofhyperspace, itshyperdrivedestroyedby Resistance agentsIden Versio,Zay Versio, andShriv Suurgav, who were on a mission to learn more about the First Order'sProject Resurrection.
[15]Chasing the Resistance[]The First Order fleet had in large numbers regrouped for the new galactic war after the fall of Starkiller. Phasma returned fromchasing downand dispatching the true culprit onLuprorawho she blamed for being behind the one who had turned off the shields at Starkiller Base. She namedLieutenantSol Rivasas the perpetrator to General Hux.
[61]The survivingStarkiller aerial defense forcepilots, such asPoldin LeHuse, were re-integrated into the fleet. They expressed a desire for vengeance and to prove themselves after failing to save the superweapon.
[14]In spite of Starkiller Base's destruction, the First Order stood poised to conquer the galaxy.
Despite the loss of Starkiller Base, the First Order still possessed a secure and intact chain of command and massive military strength in the form of hundreds of battle-cruisers and millions of troops, emerging from the shadows to seize control of the galaxy by force. Following the loss of the Galactic Senate and the Hosnian system, the New Republic lost its leadership and its entire home fleet, which, due to the Military Disarmament Act, had been the majority of the Republic military.
[14]Because of this imbalance, the New Republic was virtually helpless as First Order fleets spread across the galaxy.
[14]These events quickly led to the collapse of the New Republic's authority over the galaxy as individual planets and governments began looking to their own interests. Surviving senators dissolved the Republic's remainingtask forcesin an effort to protect their ownhomeworlds[29]while other worlds capitulated to the First Order in order to avoid direct military confrontation.
[14]As a result, the galaxy, as a whole, became divided.
[62]TheColossuswas home to a Resistance cell that the First Order hunted in the Outer Rim.
The few Republic military forces that remained were completely outclassed and destroyed by the First Order, which had spent thirty years training and preparing for the war, while the New Republic military stagnated in peace. This convinced many Republic member worlds to surrender to the First Order without a fight, rather than risk defeat and devastation. This was also a result of Republic political infighting and corruption, as Centrist senators and worlds enacted a long-planned mass secession from the New Republic to the First Order. At the same time, manyOuter Rimworlds that had been left defenseless and forgotten by the New Republic quickly became incited by the Order's promise of protection from the pirates and criminal cartels that preyed on them.
[source?]The core Resistance group found itself greatly outmatched by the First Order,[12]though the First Order also had to contend with otherResistance cells.
[63]The First Order failed to prevent thelossof intelligence on the specifications of theMandator IV-class Siege Dreadnought,[15]and further lost its grip over theColossus, whichescapedCastilon into space.
[64]However, with the loss of the New Republic and its unofficial support of their forces, the Resistance only possessed a few military ships and a few hundred soldiers. This led General Leia Organa to order the complete [evacuation of the Resistance base on D'Qar while a First Order fleet led by General Hux was on its way to destroy the Resistance once and for all.
[12]General Hux received direct instructions from the Supreme Leader to annihilate the entire Resistance.
Setting their sights on the Resistance base, Hux's forces arrived inbattleand destroyed the base, but the Resistance was able to escape before the First Order could finish them off. Despite escaping, the Resistance's speedy evacuation had cost them the vast majority of their remaining fleet and left them as fugitives wandering in space. Meanwhile, Supreme Leader Snoke summoned his apprentice, Kylo Ren, to his throne room on theSupremacy, the First Order flagship, and mocked him for his failure at Starkiller Base and his ambitions to emulate Darth Vader.
[12]The mobilesupertanker fuel depot, theColossus, shortly arrived in the aftermath of the D'Qar evacuation andtriedto retrieve coaxium from the wreckage of theFulminatrix. PhasmataskedPyreand AgentTiernywith recovering the station or destroying it if recovery proved impossible due to its strategic importance and sought to prevent them from gaining the fuel, however this effort failed and the Resistance was able to successfully recovers coaxium and flee. Pyre and Tierny vowed to hunt for theColossus.
[65]Soon afterwards,NiktoengineerNenavakasa Nalorwas sentsabotagethe platform. Posing as a stranded spacer, but was discovered as a First Order spy. Though Nena escaped, they were able to managed to undo her sabotage and escape First Order forces.
[66]The Resistance was pursued through hyperspace by a fleet of First Order warships, including Snoke's flagship, theSupremacy.
Usinghyperspace tracking, a newly developed technology descended and finally perfected from the Empire'sTarkin Initiative, the First Order tracked the Resistance to theOetchi system,[67]catching them completely off guard and destroying one of their cruisers instantly. Kylo Ren, leading a TIE squadron in his personal fighter, attacked the Resistance'scommand shipRaddusand blew up its hangar bay, taking out all of the Resistance's remaining fighters before he set his sights on the ship'sbridge, where his mother, General Leia Organa, was. Though Ren was ultimately unable to bring himself to fire, his wingmen had no such qualms and fired on the bridge, exposing it to the vacuum of space and killing the majority of the Resistance's leadership, including Admiral Gial Ackbar. Organa was able to use the Force to pull herself back aboard, but she was left incapacitated. The Resistance's chain of command fell ontoVice AdmiralAmilyn Holdo, who oversaw their outrunning of the First Order, but theirfuelsupplies were dangerously low, and one by one their other ships were running dry and being destroyed by theSupremacy'sturbolasers.
[12]Once theRadduswas almost out of fuel, the Resistance began to fragment as desertions dramatically increased as members saw the struggle against the First Order as a lost cause. Later, a full-blown mutiny occurred as two sides formed among the crew: those who wanted to escape and hide from the enemy, and those who wanted to fight. This mutiny, led by Poe Dameron, was put down by the recovered General Organa, and the Resistance attempted to slip down to the former Rebel world of Crait.
[12]However, due to the capture of the Resistance infiltration team on theSupremacy, the First Order learned of the plan when the team code breakerDJbetrayed the Resistance for his freedom and payment. This led theSupremacyto fire on the unarmed and unarmored[12]U-55 orbital loadlifters,[14]destroying roughly half of them.
[12]Ren killed Snoke and usurped his position as Supreme Leader of the First Order.
Meanwhile, Kylo Ren brought Rey to Snoke's throne room onboard theSupremacy, but Snoke's short reign over the galaxy ended as Ren killed his master along with his guards, while in a desperate sacrificial gamble to save the Resistance, Vice Admiral Holdo aimed theRaddusat theSupremacyand entered lightspeed. As a result, the ship collided with the First Order flagship and cleaved it and severalResurgent-class Star Destroyers in half, saving the Resistance remnant and causing heavy damage to the First Order fleet.
[12]Ren seized the title of Supreme Leader after the demise of Snoke. Driven by his rejection of the past, Ren endeavored to build a new galactic order by destroying the combined legacy of the Jedi, the Sith, the Rebellion, and all that came before.
[12]The First Order's forces quickly recovered, and, under the orders of the newly proclaimed Supreme Leader, sent an invading force ofAll Terrain Armored TransportandAll Terrain MegaCaliber Sixwalkersdown to theabandoned rebel baseon Crait where the Resistance was taking shelter.
[12]Ren personally led the siege of the Resistance's forces[14]at theBattle of Crait.
[12]Luke Skywalker's sacrifice ensured the survival of the Resistance and the Jedi Order.
During the battle, theMillennium Falcon,pilotedby Chewbacca and Rey, arrived and attacked the First Order's TIE fighters, drawing them away from the battlefield. Even so, the battle led to the continued deaths of many of the remaining Resistance soldiers and personnel and the further depletion of its equipment. In addition, the Resistance's allies in the Outer Rim were called on for reinforcements, but did not arrive. However, Luke Skywalker unexpectedly appeared and confronted the First Order alone on the battlefield. Ren ordered all of the walkers to open fire on Skywalker in an attempt to destroy him. However, Skywalker miraculously emerged unscathed, and Ren went down to the surface to personally face his old Jedi Master. During their duel, Ren realized he was actually fighting aForce projectionof Skywalker, who was still onAhch-To. Skywalker's projection vanished, leaving Ren furious as the distraction bought time for the remaining few dozen Resistance personnel to flee aboard theMillennium Falconwith Rey's help.
[12]Conquering the galaxy[]The First Order conquered much of the galaxy, becoming an empire in all but name under Supreme Leader Kylo Ren.
In the immediate aftermath of the Battle of Crait, the newly-christened Supreme Leader Kylo Ren set forth to establish his dominion over the galaxy. The First Order had taken possession of the Outer Rim world ofBraccaand even the Core World ofCorelliawith little resistance as the galaxy having been left largely defenseless following the Starkiller incident. Anemergency election on Akivaresulted in the victory of a pro-First Order merchant while the First Order arrived onRyloth, giving theRyloth shipping guildfive days to tithe before the shipping lanes would beblockaded. The Resistance had fled to Ryloth, setting up in aRyloth Defense Authority base, until a resident ofLessubetrayed them to the First Order. Despite aFirst Order attackon the base, the Resistance escaped the planet.
[69]Sometime later, General Hux was informed of a sighting of Resistance operative Finn, but he dismissed it and told the lieutenant who had given him the information that the First Order wouldn't listen to every little word somebody said about the Resistance. Right then, Supreme Leader Ren came up to the bridge of theFinalizerand chastised Hux in front of the lieutenant, informing him that the First Order would in fact do anything to destroy the Resistance. To set an example, the First Order launched an assault that resulted in thedestructionof the neutral world ofTah'Nuhnafor assisting the Resistance after their escape from Crait.
[70]Meanwhile,Mika Grey, a traveler searching forSith artifactsto keep them out of the First Order's hands, was being tracked by AgentRaithand a squad ofFirst Order Raiders, stormtroopers commissioned by their commander, Supreme Leader Ren, with hunting down ancient Sith artifacts.
[71]The Raiders were searching for a Sithrelicfrom aburied templeonAshas Ree, where theyencounteredtheColossusResistance cell, who were also looking to acquire the relic. However, the First Order Raiders failed to acquire it and perished when the Sith relic unleashed an explosive wave of energy that incinerated Raith and his troops.
[72]Ren forbade the galaxy from having any contact with the Resistance on pain of death.
The First Order then went to neutral world ofFondorwhere a Resistance party had been spotted. A thorough, brutal interrogation of a Fondorofficialrevealed that while the Resistance group went through the system, the official wouldn't lend any assistance. However, Supreme Leader Ren declared that even mere contact with the enemy wastreason, and it gave him the excuse that he needed to put theFondor Shipyardsunder complete First Order control. Ren then personally beheaded the official for this perceived treason with a swipe of his lightsaber—stating that the Empire had been too lenient.
[73]The First Order then prepared to make an example ofMon Calaafter a fleet of at least twelveResurgent-class warships arrived over Mon Cala acting on intelligence that the Resistance was there. There, a fleet of Mon Cala warships led byAftab Ackbarmanaged to escape the planet's surface from the far side and jump to hyperspace, making the First Order aware that theMon CalamariandQuarrenshad chosen not to remain neutral and instead had given their support to the Resistance.
[74]By then, the First Order had already had established a presence on Corellia.
[75]The First Order's invasion of the galaxy proceeded virtually unopposed following the annihilation of the New Republic.
As the war progressed, the First Order launched a manhunt for the surviving members of the Resistance, deploying forces to various locations across the galaxy. Ren personally oversaw the search for Resistance fugitives at theBlack Spire OutpostonBatuu, having traveled to the remote installation via aTIE/es assault shuttleafter receiving word that Rey had apparently been sighted on Batuu. Upon his arrival atDocking Bay 9, Ren was greeted by a First Order officer whom he deemed incompetent, and consequently strangled the officer by way of the Force.
[76]Sometime later, First Order forces gained control of abactaproduction plant onTevel, but it was retaken by the Resistance and theTevellans.
[77]Sometime later, the First Orderlight cruiser, theLadara Vex, wasdispatchedtoMinfarin order to obtain a weapon that could control theZixonknown as theEcho Horn, but it was destroyed by Resistance member sympathizers.
[78]A dark alliance[]In35 ABY,[6]the Sith Eternal cult revealed itself to the galaxy bybroadcastinga message that declared revenge using the voice of Emperor Palpatine, the widely known and public identity of the Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Sidious, who was still believed to be dead. After this event, Supreme Leader Kylo Ren, who was determined to destroy any potential threats to his rule over the galaxy,foundaSith wayfinderonMustafarownedby his grandfather, Darth Vader, which had been imbued by means of the Force with coordinates.
[5]Ren discovered secrets hidden on Exegol, from the Emperor's rebirth and the creation of Snoke, to the construction of the Final Order.
Ren used thewayfinderto travel alone to its destination, where he discovered the hidden world of the Sith, Exegol, in the Unknown Regions. At theSith Citadel, Sidious revealed himself to Supreme Leader Ren and divulged that he had created the former Supreme Leader Snoke. The Sith Lord thought of the First Order as "just the beginning" and revealed to Ren the so-calledFinal Order,[5]a massive fleet of planet-destroyingXyston-class Star Destroyers,[9]created alongside anarmyofSith troopersby the Sith Eternal cult.
[9]After a generation the work of the Emperor's followers was effectively complete;[79]theSith Eternal militarywas on the verge of launching a full-scale invasion of the galaxy, its objective to restore Sith rule in the form of a new Sith Empire.
[9]The Emperor advised Ren that he could use the Sith fleet to succeed where his grandfather Vader failed, ruling the galaxy as the new Emperor. He offered Ren the fleet on the condition of killing the Jedi apprentice Rey. The Dark Lord then warned Ren that Rey was, in fact, his granddaughter, and thus aPalpatineherself.
[5]Ren endeavored to succeed Sidious as the new Emperor ruling all the galaxy.
At a meeting of theSupreme Councilon theResurgent-class Star DestroyerSteadfast,[9]Ren informed theFirst Order officersthat a spy in their ranks had supplied information to the Resistance. Though he was unaware of the mole's identity, Ren was confident that the fleet on Exegol would make him invincible, transforming the First Order into a true Empire. GeneralDomaric Quinnexpressed distrust over the Sith Eternal, denouncing them as a cult of conjurers and soothsayers.
Allegiant GeneralEnric Prydecountered that the Sith Star Destroyers would increase their resources ten thousandfold, correcting what he believed was the "error" of Starkiller Base. RenchokedGeneral Quinn to death after he openly questioned the Supreme Leader as to what the Emperor was asking for in return. He then ordered the council to crush any worlds that defied them, and announced that he and his Knights of Ren were going hunting for "the scavenger," Rey.
[5]The First Order found Rey, alongside Finn, Dameron, and Chewbacca, onPasaanaand alerted the local garrison.
First Order jet trooperspursued them into the desert plains of Pasaana as the First Order arrived to Pasaana; the group escaped, though Chewbacca was captured by the Knights of Ren and brought on board Ren's Star Destroyer while Rey and Ren confronted each other in the desert. Later, the Knights of Ren tracked the group toKijimi, a worldoccupiedby the First Order.
[5]Ren was determined to take the Emperor's throne with Rey, a Jedi apprentice, by his side.
Ren arrived at Kijimi on his Star Destroyer and locked down the city. Finn and Poe Dameron were captured and, alongside Chewbacca, sentenced to execution, but Hux freed them, revealing himself to be the spy. The group liberated theMillennium Falconand escaped, though not before Ren revealed to Rey that she was the granddaughter of Sidious and that they formed aForce dyad. Pryde deduced Hux to be the spy and executed him on sight with a blaster rifle. Ren meanwhile conferred with Sidious over the Force; the Sith Lord threatened to turn his fleet against Ren if he betrayed their agreement, but Ren told Sidious he knew where Rey was going.
[5]Battle of Exegol[]After Ren renounced the dark side, Sidious gave command of the Final Order fleet to Allegiant General Enric Pryde.
Ren confronted Rey alone among theDeath Star ruinsonKef Bir, anoceanmoon ofEndor. The two fought in alightsaber duel; Ren bested Rey, but was distracted when his mother Organa reached out to him through the Force, allowing Rey to stab him with his own lightsaber before sensing Organa's presence. Rey healed her archenemy with the Force before leaving with his ship. Motivated by a memory of his late father, Han Solo, Ren renounced the dark side and reclaimed his identity as Ben Solo. Though Organa's sacrifice interferred with Sidious' plan, the Emperor was not deterred and instead refocused his efforts toward his granddaughter, Rey.
[5]Pryde was contacted by Sidious while on board theSteadfast.
[5]The Imperial veteran,[9]having served the Emperor during the Galactic Civil War, pledged his allegiance to Sidious[5]who in turn granted the Pryde control over the Sith fleet. This action officially allied the Sith Eternal and the First Order.
[80]With Pryde's support, Sidious decided that the time had come to deploy the Final Order throughout the galaxy. He summoned Pryde to Exegol and sent him a ship from the fleet,[5]theDerriphan,[9]to destroy Kijimi as a show of force against the Resistance. Following thedestruction of Kijimi, Pryde oversaw the Sith fleet, which was in the process of departure when the Resistance arrived prior to theCitizens' Fleet, resulting in theBattle of Exegol.
[5]With the destruction of theSteadfast, the Sith fleet could not reinforce the First Order.
During the battle, General Pryde had the source of a navigation signal that the Sith fleet needed to deploy off world switched from anavigation toweron Exegol to a beacon on his command ship. However, a Resistancelanding teammade landing on Pryde's command ship. Former stormtroopers ofCompany 77covered Resistance troopers from theirorbaksas they fought against Sith troopers that landed to defend the ship. The landing team successfully knocked out the navigation tower and retreated, but the First Order officers were able to reset it. At the same time Darth Sidious, after healing himself, attacked the Resistance and galactic forces, but he was stopped by Rey, when she deflected Sidious's lightning back towards him, causing the Emperor to disintegrate and be destroyed at last, preventing the rebirth of the Sith.
Meanwhile former stormtroopers Finn and Jannah stayed behind on the hull of the ship and turned the ship's ownturbolasersagainst it, killing Pryde and destroying theSteadfast, and with it, the navigation signal, preventing the remaining Sith Star Destroyers from launching off of Exegol and reinforcing the First Order. Finn and Jannah narrowly escaped aboard theMillennium Falconwith the help of GeneralLando Calrissianand Chewbacca as theSteadfastexploded and plunged to Exegol's surface.
[5]Uprisings[]The Battle of Exegol was followed by a galaxy-wide uprising against the First Order.
In the aftermath of the Battle of Exegol, the First Order's forces came under attack by the populations that they had subjugated. Inspired by the victory of the Resistance and their rallied citizens' fleet, peoplerose upall over the galaxy against the First Order, including onBespin, Endor, Jakku,[5]Coruscant,Naboo,Corellia,Lothal, andThyferra.
[81]The First Order fell across the galaxy, and was ultimately defeated in the war.
[11]Organization[]Government[]The Supreme Leader wielded absolute power and authority over the First Order.
The Supreme Leader was a self-appointed position with absolute power over the First Order[11]who delegated power to a number of high-rankingofficersandadvisors, effectively removing any distinction between military and state. This formed an upper cadre of high-rankingofficials, theFirst Order High Command, who had the authority to govern the First Order in the Supreme Leader's name.
[4]As Supreme Leader, Snoke was content to focus on spiritual matters, ceding control of military matters to generals and the shaping of the First Order's public image topropagandamasterminds. However, any and all alterations to the strategy required the Supreme Leader's approval, with personal interests regarded as secondary to orders from the Leader, while a "commanding triumvirate" of the First Order existed consisting of Kylo Ren, General Armitage Hux, and Captain Phasma, the leaders ofStarkiller Base.
[4]Unbeknownst to even the highest echelons of the First Order, however, Snoke was in fact an artificial creation engineered by a hidden Sith cult, the Sith Eternal, under the directive of their master, Darth Sidious who returned from the dead, the Emperor of the Old Empire. Several addition clones of Snoke were stored on their hidden redoubt world, Exegol.
[5]Snoke served Darth Sidious and the Sith Eternal as a means to groom Ben Solo as Kylo Ren. Snoke kept his homeworld and origins concealed from the First Order so as to avoid revealing himself to be an artificial creation; nonetheless, some came to realize that Snoke was subservient to an unseen force and master.
[9]Due to the Supreme Leader's status in the First Order, an officer who had direct access to his person effectively wielded greater authority than theirmilitary rankwould indicate.
[14]They oversaw the colonization of the Unknown Regions and destruction of the last Jedi. Much like Darth Vader in the former Empire, Kylo Ren existed outside the formal command structure of the First Order and frequently came into conflict with military officials owing to his agenda consistently trumping military objectives. Kylo's placement in the hierarchy not only maintained fear within the Order's upper ranks but also intentionally resembled that of Darth Vader's during the reign of the Old Empire.
[4]It was the prerogative of the Supreme Leader to summon his subordinates at his pleasure, as well as to administer punishment to those who failed him.
[12]Supreme Leader would call conference to discuss goals for the First Order.
The Supreme Council was established under Supreme Leader Kylo Ren as anadvisoryboard to replace the former triumvirate. It was formed by high-ranking members of High Command who served asaidesto Ren and had direct access to the highest levels of authority in the First Order, including the Supreme Leader. The council's purpose was to chart and implement the ongoing galactic conquest and plan the future of governing the galaxy. It was composed of Allegiant General Enric Pryde, AdmiralFrantis Griss, and GeneralsAmret Engell, Armitage Hux,Bellava Parnadee, andDomaric Quinn, allowing Ren to focus on spiritual matters as his predecessor had.
[9]Ren anticipated the council would be filled with infighting, to which he considered it good for his reign, as he preferred that they direct their energies against each other, thereby diminishing their chances of uniting against him.
[9]The First Order lacked a traditional planetary capital, preferring mobile headquarters such as theSupremacyor theSteadfast.
Starkiller Base, a superweapon constructed within the planetIlum,[9]hosted the largest military deployment in the First Order. However, it was not considered the official capital of the First Order because of Supreme Leader Snoke's policy of keeping the Order's headquarters mobile.
[10]Although various officers and allies of the First Order argued for a planet to act as their capital, Snoke rejected this idea and refused to designate capital command to a world either under direct First Order control or within the Unknown Regions, instead opting to command his underlings from his mobile command post, theMega-class Star DreadnoughtSupremacy, making it the First Order's capital.
[82]Military[]TheResurgent-class Star Destroyer was a successor to theImperial-class Star Destroyer.
With its rapidly expanding military in clear violation of the Galactic Concordance and Republic laws, the massive militarization effort of the First Order continued throughout its tenure in the Unknown Regions. There, military bases and shipyards were constructed to churn out some of the technologically superior weapons and starfighters utilized by the Order's military. To avoid treaty restrictions banning the sale of weapons to the First Order, galactic arms manufacturers BlasTech Industries and Merr-Sonn Munitions, Inc. spun off a subsidiary known as the Sonn-Blas Corporation, which manufactured much of the First Order's weaponry within First Order space.
Sienar-Jaemus Fleet Systemsalso helped produce vessels such as theUpsilon-class command shuttleandTIE/fo space superiority fighter, along with its two-seated variant theTIE/sf space superiority fighter.
[10]Sienar-Jaemus Army Systems manufactured the widely usedAAL, which could ferry twenty stormtroopers into combat, while the Aratech-Loratus Corporation developed theLIUV;[10]On ground, the First Order also used a wide range of four-legged walkers similar to Imperial AT-ATs.
[4]In violation of New Republic laws regarding capital ships,Kuat-Entralla Engineeringdeveloped theResurgent-class Star Destroyer, which featured more than 1,500turbolasers, point-defense laser cannons andion cannons, and was specifically designed to evoke the fearful image of the Old Empire'sImperial-class Star Destroyers. Though smaller than theImperial Navyat its height, the First Order Navy became a formidable concentration of spaceborne destructive power. Owing to the New Republic's disarmament efforts, the First Order's fleets of Star Destroyers stood almost unchallenged.
[10]Holding to the legacy of the Old Empire, the First Order trained a new generation of stormtroopers.
Like itspredecessor, the First Order Stormtrooper Corps was a component of the military that employed the use of stormtroopers,[83]including variants such assnowtroopers. It also utilized specialists includingmegablaster heavy assault troopers,flametroopers, andriot control stormtroopersand selectively had one of the three variants placed in every ten-member stormtrooper squad. Unlike the inconsistent academy standards of the previous Galactic Empire, training of the new generation of stormtroopers emphasized improvisation and counter-insurgency operations, including guerrilla tactics. With the First Order lacking the numerical superiority of the Galactic Empire, better-equipped and -trained soldiers resulted in higher trooper proficiency than the previous Galactic Empire. Soldiers were often trained on capital ships and underwent vivid simulations to create the most loyal soldiers, which was an extension of the ideas of Commandant Brendol Hux and hisCommandant's Cadets.
[10]It was strictly forbidden for a stormtrooper to initiate any contact with a officer in line with the First Order view on hierarchy.
[29]Starkiller Base was a First Order superweapon capable of annihilating multiple planets in a single shot.
One of its primary bases of operations was Starkiller Base, aniceplanet converted into a stronghold. Seeking to rule the galaxy through fear, the base housed a superweapon capable of destroying entirestar systemsby firing a planet-destroying beam through hyperspace, and was led by an unofficial triumvirate of General Armitage Hux, Kylo Ren, and Captain Phasma until it was destroyed in the Assault on Starkiller Base.
[4][84][10]The scale of the First Order's military operation shocked complacent New Republic observers, who had believed such shows of force were merely part of local defense forces and ceremonial guards.
[16]With the rapid expansion of the First Order's stormtrooper ranks and military capabilities, the Resistance believed that more trooper specializations were yet to be discovered, and ships even larger than theResurgent-class Star Destroyers existed,[10]such as theMandator IV-class Siege Dreadnought and theMega-class Star Dreadnought.
[14]Technological development allowed the First Order to transform a planet into a superlaser platform.
The First Order continued the research into dark energy translations and hyperspace tunneling that had began under the Old Empire, where they repurposed an ice world for the development of a mobile superweapon called Starkiller Base, which used a dark energy called "quintessence" as it offered a virtual unlimited power source,[10][4]this was made possible after securing logs from secret Imperial laboratories detailing a suitable planet needed with the correct specifications for what would become Starkiller Base with the colossal superlaser array itself built into the planetary crust and would to the Order represent a technological step forward in power.
[85]TheSupremacy's hyperspace tracker technology was developed for military use.
The First Order also developed the hyperspace tracker which was a type ofactive trackerwith the ability to detect starships traveling through hyperspace developed by First Order scientists. Originally studied by the Tarkin Initiative during the reign of the Empire, the technology was not established for several more decades when a team assembled by General Armitage Hux discovered how to implement the technology. The hyperspace tracker utilized a complexstatic hyperspace field generator, which enveloped arrays of databanks and computers in a localized hyperspace field that accelerated their calculation speeds to unimaginable rates.
[14]Additionally, the First Order constructed asuperlaser siege cannon, which was a form of miniaturized Death Star technology that was capable of firing a devastating energy pulse along a targetingtracer beamto cause a powerful detonation upon impact. Being a two-hundred-metercannon, it required support, such as having vehicles that were able to maneuver it into position during a siege and could be deployed to have a retractable stabilizing outrigger to ground its bulk.
[14]The First Order had also developed huge data banks loaded with centuries of combat reports andastrogationdata. This was aided by a static hyperspace field that accelerated their processing power to an unprecedented level, which was overseen by theShipboard Tracking Control Complexthat was the size of a planetary intelligence hub.
[82]Intelligence[]Agent Terex operated from his personal ship, theCarrion Spike.
TheFirst Order Security Bureauwas the intelligence-gathering arm of the First Order, and was tasked with guarding state secrets and recovering information that had been stolen by the First Order's enemies.
[20][51]Under Supreme Leader Snoke's directive, First Order agents and other First Order military forces were prohibited from seeking open hostility against forces aligned with the New Republic including the Resistance.
[45]Foreign affairs[]Prior to the fall of the New Republic, the First Order used diplomacy as a means of expanding its influence to other worlds.
The First Order despised the New Republic as an illegitimate regime that tolerated disorder in the galaxy,[4]while the Republic did not officially recognize the First Order as a government,[69]and instead viewed the Order as an ill-organized, poorly equipped, and badly funded group of Imperial loyalists.
[40].
As a result, the Republic maintained an almost non-existent relationship with the First Order, resulting in ignored diplomatic protests and observers being denied access; an example of this was during the First Orderblockadeof theOtomok systemto which the galactic government objected but the Order informed them it was an internal affair, which the Republic accepted.
[35]The First Order would attempt to complete their objectives through diplomacy before military action.
In an effort to subvert the New Republic, the First Order also channelled funds through shell and third-party corporations in theCorporate Sectorto corrupt RepublicsenatorslikeErudo Ro-Kiintor, who blocked motions advocating sanctions against the First Order and increasing support for theNew Republic Starfleet.
[40]Consequently, the First Order's main military adversary was theResistance, a private military organization founded byGeneralLeia Organain response to the Republic's unwillingness to take action against the Order.
[10]The First Order saw its primary mission as restoring order to a lawless galaxy and viewed the Republic and Resistance as obstacles to achieving these goals.
[40]About thirty years after the Battle of Endor, the First Order launched a preemptive attack on the Hosnian system in order to destroy the Republic and force the wider galaxy into submission. Later, the First Order successfully destroyed the Resistance'sbaseon D'Qar. However, the remaining Resistance forces were able to evacuate[4]and continue their fight against the First Order.
[5]The First Order was also known to have dealings with other entities like the Corporate Sector Authority[40]and theGuavian Death Gang.
[4]Judiciary[]In the First Order, disloyalty was regularly punished with public executions.
There was no line between the military and justice in the First Order, which had a merciless attitude towardstreasonamong other things, where it dispensedfinal justiceon anyone with even slight loyalty issues perday; this was done as several public executions with the executioners coming from the ranks of the Stormtrooper Corps anonymously in rotations, with it being considered an effective method of stormtrooper training. Unlike most stormtrooper variants, they were not from a specialist unit, but were instead randomly picked among regular stormtroopers for that day depending on various assignments and their identity was left anonymous.
[14]Assigned to keep order on worlds within First Order territory, a specialized variant of the standard stormtrooper were trained in riot-control tactics and given non-lethal equipment to suppress any disorder,[87]as well as some lethal weapons, such as theSonn-BlasF-11D blaster rifle, in case situations spiraled out of control.
[10]The First Order also usedcyberneticsas a form of punishment by turning someone into a cyborg to ensure loyalty, as was the case with rogue agent Terex.
[88]The First Order would also dismiss any strike action and would send in stormtroopers to enforce and "restore order" as part of a law and order operation, and would simply kill any negotiators to resolve any strike.
[40]The First Order made it illegal to even communicate with the Resistance and considered it an act of treason that would result in being executed,[73]and the act of speaking ill of the Supreme Leader was determined as a crime.
[69]Society and culture[]The First Order was a totalitarian fascist society located on the far side of the galaxy.
Growing up in isolation on the far side of the galaxy gave citizens of the First Order an Imperially-skewed version of galactic history,[10]where they adopted a radicalfascist[1]neo-Imperialismpoliticalideology, basing it values on a fanatical devotion to the totalitarian notions of "order" and violent disdain for theNew Republicanddemocracy.
[2]Under the guidance of Imperial veterans, along with approved literature, vids, and mandatory viewings of morale sessions twice a day for stormtrooper cadets, officers learned of their glorious past and how they had been robbed of it by terrorists and rebels, who later called themselves the New Republic. Many believed only they could have the power necessary to wrest the galaxy from a path of chaos and corruption.
[10]This claim was not without some basis. The New Republic's corruption and ineffectiveness was plain to see across the galaxy, from its citizens to the Resistance and the First Order. In fact, this corruption was one of the First Order's most potent weapons, as they ensured their agenda met with no interference from the Senate. The First Order's citizens saw this as proof the Rebellion was built on false promises, and that rebels could only tear down a government, not build one.
[7]A large number of individuals in the First Order were non-humanalienswho were effectively second-class citizens. This was apparent in the First Order propaganda and labor policies.
[40]Pre-recorded speeches often filled the airwaves, in which General Armitage Hux commented on instances of the Republic's depravity, including famines onIbaarandAdarlon, the brutal suppression of the people ofBalamak, and unchecked alien advances throughout the Outer Rim. Following these reports were stories of First Order victories such as liberating labor camps onIktotchor winning a fleet battle in theBormea sector. Despite these patriotic functions and rallies, the First Order heavily relied on the brutal suppression of dissent and unpatriotic activities. Riot control stormtroopers were specially trained to quash insurrection, with live-fire dispersal of protesters permitted. Industrial unrest such as theStrike at Pressy's Tumblewere blamed on New Republic agents. According to the First Order, the Jedi were officially extinct, and it was forbidden to pronounce Kylo Ren's birth name by order of Supreme Leader Snoke.
[40][10]To boost morale, the First Order utilized a commemorativerank insignia system, issuing armbands bearing the names of famous units and heroes of the Galactic Civil War. Many in the military believed that despite being outnumbered by the New Republic Starfleet, their technological superiority was so complete that even their smaller navy stood virtually unchallenged.
[10]The First Order conscripted human children, and indoctrinated them with state propaganda, ensuring absolute loyalty and devotion to its cause.
The First Order had no qualms with inducting children into direct combat.
[14]The most infamous example of the latter was the stormtroopers of the First Order, which forcibly subjected any children of worlds conquered by the First Order to military training.
[14][10]Because the First Order trained its soldiers from birth, several members had very high ranks despite their youth technically making them closer to junior officers, in contrast to the Empire'sSub-Adult Group, which promoted patriotism without subjecting its members to direct combat.
[14]However brutal, the First Order's recruitment methods were lauded by their personnel and even by some of their conscripts. Many of the children the First Order recruited came from poor, impoverished Outer Rim worlds, where lawlessness was rampant and the residents had few to no prospects in life. Due to these horrific conditions, many of the people happily surrendered their children to the First Order willingly, either hoping they would have a better life or simply desiring payment and one fewer mouth to feed. Some freelance recruiters for the First Order agreed these children were better off under the First Order than on their homeworlds; one bragged that Athulla was such a "nightmare" the First Order was doing its children a favor.
[15]One of these impoverished children inducted into the First Order's ranks, from the desert world of Jakku, would rise to become a respected officer in the First Order: Captain Cardinal.
[7]The Benathy worshiped the First Order itself after the death of their "god."Once recruited, citizens and soldiers of the First Order were indoctrinated to have a strong sense of duty, loyalty, and obedience to the state, and taught to forgo their personal desires for the greater good of the First Order. To this end, recruits abandoned their previous lives and identities upon their induction into the First Order and submitted to being identified by a numerical code. Senior officers and distinguished members of the Stormtrooper Corps, such as Phasma and Cardinal, were not expected to do so. First Order citizens were educated to believe it had been the pursuit of individual selfishness and desires that led the Rebel Alliance to topple the Old Empire. They were also taught that the rebels were short-sighted terrorists who could not see the benefit of the Old Empire, and instead started a war that forced it to crack down on personal liberties in response.
[7]TheBenathywere not only indoctrinated into First Order ideology but worshiped the totalitarian regime itself after thedeathof theZillo Beastthat they worshiped as theirgod.
[89]Despite this doctrine, First Order military training heavily emphasized individual strength and improvisation, both physically and mentally. Training programs that were mandatory for all recruits beginning at a young age became progressively more severe as they grew to adulthood. The First Order, like the Empire before it, believed the strong naturally rose to power, while the weaker were left to serve their natural leaders.
[7]Sometime during one's life within the First Order, they took an oath, one in which both high-ranking members such as General Artimage Hux or soldiers such as the former FN-2187 were cited as recipients, and in the First Order, renouncing that oath made them seen as something worse than even a Resistance fighter.
[39]Economy[]Pillaging entire worlds filled the First Order's coffers with various currencies, including coins minted from precious metals.
The First Order economy was tightly controlled, partly due to treaty restrictions that prevented major galactic corporations from selling arms to the First Order, owing to it Imperial origins. Nevertheless, they had dealings with the Aratech-Loratus Corporation,Rebaxan Columni, Sienar-Jaemus Fleet Systems, Kuat-Entralla Engineering andSonn-Blas Corporation—a subsidiary of the First Order military's major arms manufacturers, Merr-Sonn Munitions, Inc. and BlasTech Industries. The First Order plundered the worlds within its domain in order to fill its coffers with various currencies, particularly coins minted from precious metals such asaurei,peggatsandzemids, all of which had universal value as they could be melted down.
[14]Thecreditwas also a recognized currency in the First Order economy,[13]although by then coinage made from valuable metals was considered preferable to electronic currencies, especially in an era of instability.
[14]Having amassed a vast treasury through conquest and plunder,[14]the First Order used its profits to purchase weapons from war profiteers onCantonicain theCorporate Sector.
[90][12]They also channeled large sums of money through shells and third-party corporations with help from the Corporate Sector Authority.
[40]To avoid the terms of the Galactic Concordance which included the sale of weapons to the Order, arms manufacturersBlasTech IndustriesandMerr-Sonn Munitions, Inc.
opted to bypass these restrictions by forming a subsidiary known as the Sonn-Blas Corporation, which manufactured all weapons within First Order space, whileSienar-Jaemus Army SystemsandAratech-Loratus Corporationwould develop spacecraft and vehicles to the Order.
[10]Infrastructure[]The First Order upheld a number of factories and mines.
The airwaves infrastructure in the First Order was under full state oversight and had tight restrictions and censorship imposed on it, which were often filled with pre recorded speeches in line with military objectives, this was there-for used by the ruling junta to maintain its control of the masses by using propaganda.
[40][10]The First Order utilized a form of holographic technology that could show the user in full color and lacked any scan lines as part of its communications systems.
[4]TheSupremacycommunication complex was used to watchHoloNettraffic throughout the galaxy, this was to help identify trends and weaknesses that the First Order could use to further their goals, it could also be used to dispatched orders to agents operating within both New Republic and independent space.
[14]TheSupremacyalso held industrial capabilities including research labs and factories onboard, this housed departments for conception, research and well-stocked raw materials reserves, eight durasteel foundries as well as an asteroid mining complex for harvesting raw materials directly from asteroid fields, as well as state-of-the-art production lines that could not be cut off from supply lines. It also had at least eight droid manufacturing facilities.
[82]Station Theta Blackspace stationwas used tomineand processdedlaniteto makeblastersfor the army.
[91]Astrography[]First Order Space was located in the Outer Rim Territories and the Unknown Regions of the galaxy.
The First Order claimed the large, unexplored regionbeyond the frontierto the west of the Core as its heartland, with the emergent power expanding across the vast swaths of space left untouched for millennia by galactic explorers,[14]includingDemir,[92]as well as a handful ofsectorsclaimed by the First Order in the Outer Rim Territories. The First Order undertook a major offensive against several of these kingdoms to seize their worlds and resources to fuel their rise.
[29][93][41]Numerous shipyards, bases, and research facilities were also built on newly explored star systems and colonized worlds as the Order slowly expanded and plotted its eventual return to the galaxy at large.
[10]The First Order's domain expanded into the known galaxy through the annexation of a bloc of star systems that seceded from the New Republic.
[9]The Centrists, a political faction in the Galactic Senate,[38]wanted a more centralized government than the one offered by the New Republic. As a result, the systems that identified with Centrist politics joined the First Order, marking its official formation as a galactic government.
[9]At the time when the Centrists called for secession, the planets that supported their political goals includedArkanis,Comra, Coruscant,Daxam IV,Hevurion,Kuat,Orinda, andRiosa.
[38]The Trans-Hydian Borderlands served as a neutral zone between First Order Space and the New Republic during the Cold War.
A narrow region of neutral systems known as the Trans-Hydian Borderlands existed between New Republic and First Order space as a result of the Cold War between the two galactic powers. Despite frequent First Order incursions into Republic space, the Galactic Senate did not wish to spark a conflict, and thus was limited to formal diplomatic protest.
[40]The First Order increased its territorial extent through galactic conquest after the New Republic's destruction.
[9]Its military presence extended to various inhabited worlds, including Bespin, Jakku, and Endor.
[5]Kijimi was also conquered and placed under military occupation. No longer required to observe treaties with a fallen government, the First Order deployed its stormtroopers across the galaxy, making the white-armored soldier a common sight once more.
[9]Behind the scenes[]The First Order was created for the2015filmStar Wars: Episode VIIThe Force Awakensand was developed through conversations amongst the production team. According toJ.J. Abrams, the film's director, the team wondered what would have happened if theNaziswho went into hiding inArgentinaafterWorld War IIstarted working together again. Abrams hinted that the First Order would therefore be a group that admired the Galactic Empire and felt that its work was unfulfilled.
[94]The First Order's exact nature during the development of the film was kept secret since the film's announcement. OnAugust 10, 2015, the officialStar WarsTwitter and GooglePlus accounts unveiled an image of the First Order congregating at Starkiller Base.
[95]Costume designerMichael Kaplansaid the First Order uniforms were designed to look severe, "very hard edge, very broad shoulders, very angular, geometric." He cited inspiration from French fashion designerThierry Mugler.
