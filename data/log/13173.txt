Microsoft announced today that its HoloLens mixed reality headset is coming to 29 new markets across Europe.
Last year, the company launched HoloLens , serving up a spellbinding digital experience via a headset that combines virtual and physical worlds through a rich set of sensors. The headset first started shipping to developers in the U.S. last March, and HoloLens has been officially available in 10 markets: the U.S., U.K., France, Canada, Japan, China, Germany, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand.
Now, HoloLens is effectively available across the entire European Union, as well as in a handful of non-EU European countries, including Turkey and Switzerland.
Today’s news comes a few months after Microsoft expanded its HoloLens Agency Readiness Partner program to Europe to help companies find creative agencies capable of building mixed reality apps. Though companies are already able to build HoloLens apps in-house through Microsoft’s software development kit (SDK), many lack the required expertise, which is why a market has cropped up allowing creative agencies to step in and fill the void.
