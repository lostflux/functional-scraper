I can’t think of anything worse than a world without video games. That’s why I can relate to a Florida kid who felt the need to contact the authorities about his PlayStation not working.
The Palm Beach county sheriff took to Twitter ( via @FloridaMan ) over the weekend to share a 9-1-1 emergency conversation that a dispatcher had with a concerned citizen. What was the nature of the emergency? Well, this caller wanted information about why the PlayStation Network and Xbox Live were not working. On Thursday, PSN and Xbox Live collapsed under a distributed denial-of-service attack that prevented many people from getting online and playing their games.
Check out PBSO’s transcription of the conversation in its tweet below: No we don't know when they will restore service to Xbox or Playstation. Please Dial 9-1-1 only for emergencies.

Reserve your spot now as space is limited! Local news channel WPTV reported that the caller was a teenager. The dispatcher actually took the time to ask around and get an answer to the caller’s question and told the caller that other people were having issues but that a call to Sony is probably more appropriate.
But, if like this Florida teen, you’re waiting for law enforcement to get involved, we’ve got some good news for you.
