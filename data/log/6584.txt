The Borderlands franchise goes low gravity on October 14th of this year with Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel.
 Preordering on PC has been available for about a month now, but just recently the game was made available at the 2game.com store front. There you can use a 20% off coupon code and drop the price of Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel to $47.99.
For those interested in the announced Season Pass of The Pre-Sequel, GameStop has the item available and it qualifies for a 15% off GameStop coupon on digital titles. Another solid incentive for Bordeland fans as we count down the clock towards October 14.
