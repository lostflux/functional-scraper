Game publisher TinyBuild has acqui-hired the development team behind hit game series Hello Neighbor from Dynamic Pixels and will invest more than $15 million in the franchise.
The new team will be called Eerie Guest Studios, and will be located be in Hilversum, Netherlands. The company didn’t disclose the deal price, but it is part of the $15 million investment. In addition to the acqui-hire, TinyBuild will put more money into the franchise over various media. Back in March, TinyBuild announced that Hello Neighbor — a horror game about a neighbor with a secret in his house — had seen over 30 million downloads , and now it says the game has more than 40 million players.
TinyBuild also said it has seen a surge in free-to-play and game subscription signups during the pandemic, indicating the popularity of value-driven entertainment as fans try to stay engaged with games without spending a lot of money. This trend played into the company’s decision to invest in the franchise and acqui-hire the development team.
TinyBuild CEO Alex Nichiporchik recently announced that the company is working on a board game version of the horror game. TinyBuild is also looking at additional acquisitions to strengthen the brand and take it to new media. A graphic novel is coming out in October, and the Hello Neighbor Animated Series pilot has 12 million views on YouTube.
