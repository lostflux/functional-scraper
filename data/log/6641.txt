Mobile-analytics outfit HasOffers has fallen in love with Seoul.
Less than a month after opening a satellite office in South Korea’s tech-crazy capital city, HasOffers has signed deals with four of the country’s largest retail chains and is finalizing the paperwork on multiple other contracts. Citing privacy issues, HasOffers chief executive Peter Hamilton declined to name them.
“It is going really, really well. The guy who is running the office there, Bryan Kim, is doing an amazing job,” Hamilton told VentureBeat.
That’s not bad for a firm like HasOffers, who found themselves fired by their then-mobile ad partner Facebook in February for violating data-storage agreements. Since that time, Hamilton and his 160-member team responded with a spirited PR campaign to show that you don’t need Facebook as a partner to succeed in mobile.
It worked.
HasOffers joins the likes of Twitter, Uber , Google, and Facebook among the dozens of other U.S. firms that have opened offices in the city of 9.8 million less than 25 miles from the dangerous DMZ with North Korea. In other words, within artillery range.
Seoul is already home to native stalwarts Samsung and LG Corp. Samsung leads the global smartphone race with their line of Galaxy devices.
HasOffers apparently has grand plans for Southeast Asia. A blog post on the HasOffers site broke down the reason for the South Korean gamble and hinted at larger ambitions.
“Our Seoul office will act as our home base for the broader Asia-Pacific market and will be staffed by sales and account managers focused on supporting current and new MobileAppTracking customers.” HasOffers produces analytical data intelligence for mobile advertising firms, enabling customers to better target consumers whatever the demographic. HasOffers’ headquarters is in Seattle.
