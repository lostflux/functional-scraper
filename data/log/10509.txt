But an ongoing study by a group of NASA-affiliated researchers is challenging this assumption. The researchers have a vision for a mission that could be built with existing technology. Indeed, the group says that if their mission is selected by NASA it could fly as soon as 2030.
‚ÄúThis is humanity‚Äôs first explicit step into interstellar space,‚Äù says Pontus Brandt, a physicist at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory who is working on the interstellar probe study.
The lab kicked off its Interstellar Probe study last summer at the behest of NASA‚Äôs Heliophysics division. A year in, they are now hashing out the nitty-gritty engineering details of such a mission. At the end of 2021, Brandt and his colleagues will submit it for inclusion in the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine‚Äôs Heliophysics decadal survey, which determines sun-related mission priorities for the next 10 years.
The basic idea for the interstellar mission is to launch a spacecraft weighing less than 1,700 pounds on NASA‚Äôs massive Space Launch System rocket, which is expected to be ready by 2021. That will get it traveling across our solar system like any other probe. To give it another boost, it will then use a gravity assist to sling the craft to speeds well over 100,000 miles per hour. The team at the Applied Physics Lab is currently considering two types of gravity assists‚Äîa ‚Äúplain vanilla‚Äù assist that swings the probe around Jupiter and another that swings it around the sun.
Using the sun is advantageous, because the spacecraft can reach far higher speeds than it can from a Jupiter assist. But the spacecraft would have to pass several times closer to the sun than the Parker Solar Probe , which recently became the closest human-made object to pass by the star. This requires some serious heat shielding, but at a certain point the heat shield becomes so bulky that it reduces the spacecraft‚Äôs speed the closer it gets to the sun. The task for Brandt and his colleagues will be to find the sweet spot that takes the craft to interstellar space as fast as possible.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time we have a vision we can actually execute,‚Äù says Ralph McNutt, a physicist at the Applied Physics Laboratory. ‚ÄúUp to now, people haven‚Äôt thought about this as an engineering problem. They kick the can down the road, saying, ‚ÄòWell, we just need a little bit more new technology.‚Äô‚Äù Science SpaceX‚Äôs Starship Lost Shortly After Launch of Second Test Flight Ramin Skibba Business Elon Musk May Have Just Signed X‚Äôs Death Warrant Vittoria Elliott Business OpenAI Ousts CEO Sam Altman Will Knight Business Who Is Mira Murati, OpenAI‚Äôs New Interim CEO? Steven Levy NASA‚Äôs interstellar probe has a more modest goal compared to other interstellar mission proposals, like Breakthrough Starshot , which aims to send a thumbnail-sized craft to another star. Instead, NASA wants to launch a probe that will last for 50 years and travel 92 billion miles‚Äîabout 1,000 times the distance from Earth to the sun. To put this in perspective, Voyager 1 and Voyager 2, the only spacecraft to make it to interstellar space, are currently around 13 billion miles away from Earth. It took those spacecraft nearly four decades to cover this distance, but NASA‚Äôs new interstellar probe could make it there in less than 15 years.
Voyager 1 entered interstellar space in 2012 and Voyager 2 left the solar system last year. They were designed to be planetary explorers, which meant they weren‚Äôt outfitted with many of the instruments physicists would need to get a deep understanding of interstellar space. While the two spacecraft have returned a wealth of data, their journey to the stars has raised far more questions than answers.
Of particular interest to physicists is the nature of the heliosphere, a bubble of space sustained by the pressure from the solar wind. Beyond the heliosphere‚Äôs semipermeable boundary, known as the heliopause, particles originating from the sun become scarce ,and particles emanating from the rest of the galaxy dominate. The transition from solar system to interstellar space is still a great mystery to physicists, as is the structure of the heliosphere itself.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre sitting inside a bubble trying to figure out what shape it is, which is extremely hard,‚Äù says Brandt. ‚ÄúThe uniqueness of an interstellar probe is that we can go out and take a picture of our habitable little bubble in space.‚Äù But NASA‚Äôs interstellar probe wouldn‚Äôt just be looking backward to snap selfies of our cosmological home. It could also sample the zodiacal cloud, a mysterious ring of dust that extends to the outer region of the heliosphere and holds clues to the formation of our solar system. Traveling beyond this dust cloud will also give the spacecraft access to infrared light from the earliest galaxies in the universe that is otherwise blocked.
Brandt says it‚Äôs impossible to know just what an interstellar probe might find out there, but a dedicated mission beyond the solar system would drastically alter our understanding of the universe and our place in it. Still, despite interest from scientists around the world, there are no guarantees this mission will ever launch.

Steven Levy In the early 2000s, the Applied Physics Lab led a similar study for NASA called the Innovative Interstellar Explorer that aimed to launch a probe beyond the solar system by 2018. Although an interstellar mission received a lot of attention in the last heliophysics decadal survey in 2012, Brandt says the consensus was that the technology for such a mission wasn‚Äôt ready.
‚ÄúThe whole problem has been propulsion all along,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúBut with the SLS this is no longer true. This is real and we want to have the technology ready by 2030.‚Äù Of course, SLS is having its own problems getting to the launch pad , but now that private space companies are in the business of building huge rockets , an interstellar probe might have several different rides to choose from. The bottom line is that the technology for an interstellar mission is ready, and a growing contingent of space scientists have made it clear that they‚Äôre done waiting around to take the next giant step into the cosmos.
