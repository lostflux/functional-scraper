 I am the research lead of Project Malmo , which uses the popular game Minecraft as an experimentation platform for developing intelligent technology. My long-term goal is to develop AI systems that learn to collaborate with people, to empower their users and help solve complex real-world problems.
Outside of Project Malmo, I work on online evaluation and interactive learning for information retrieval. This means that I try to understand how we can apply machine learning an artificial intelligence to develop more intelligent search and recommendation systems.
​ Before joining Microsoft Research, I completed my PhD in Computer Science as part of the ILPS group at the University of Amsterdam.
 I worked with Maarten de Rijke and Shimon Whiteson on smart search engines that learn directly from their users.
