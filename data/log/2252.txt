Paul Amayo I am a researcher and technology enthusiast with broad experience in both hardware and software development over various sectors (from self-driving cars in the UK to para-transit in Kenya) with a primary focus on robotics. I strongly believe that technology holds the key to solving some of the world’s and in particular Africa’s most pressing problems. My interests are therefore not only in advancement of technology through research but also in its subsequent education that ensures that this technology is adopted into communities where it would be do the most good. I am currently a Senior Lecturer and Prinicipal Investigator at the University of Cape Town Emma Ruttkamp-Bloem Professor Emma Ruttkamp-Bloem is a philosopher of science and technology, an AI ethics policy adviser and a machine ethics researcher.
