6th generation Skylake machines have finally arrived at Dell. Notable updated machines includes Dell’s popular mainstream Inspiron 11, 13, and 15 line-ups – and on the performance/gaming side, Dell’s premium Alienware line-ups. Not all laptops and desktops have been upgraded to Skylake, but those that come with Intel’s latest will have a variety of option and discounts (to move these new units), particularly at the top-end.
For higher-end laptops with Core i7 Skylake processors, you’ll be able to choose from Core i7-6700HQ or the even higher performing Core i7-6820HK, which has 2MB more cache and dynamically overclocked up to 4.1Ghz (vs the 3.5 Ghhz Turbo Boost of the i7-6700HQ). Gamers should watch for the new Inspiron 15 which comes with a discrete graphics card option in the form of a Radeon R5 M335 with 4GB of RAM. Being new on the block, no benchmarks exist yet but you can read more details on the GPU here.
On the desktop side, only the Alienware X51 R3 will be graced with the 6th generation processors (as of writing anyways). Pricing starts at $699.99 and strangely there are no coupons available compared to the laptops, so we’ll list those deals when they become available. The X51 R3 will have configuration option of: Core i3-6100, Core i5-6400, Core i5-6600K, along with Core i7-6700 and Core i7-6700K.
