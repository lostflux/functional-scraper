Having an engaging website, good customer support, and a clearly-defined image of your products and services are all key variables when it comes to growing and maintaining an audience, and you should, of course, always keep an eye on the bottom line.
Still, it should come as no surprise that Instagram has emerged as one of the most valuable platforms when it comes to attracting new users, and its global reach grows larger every day. But in order to truly take advantage of the massive reach and engagement that Instagram has to offer, you need to know how to do more than simply post the occasional picture or story.
