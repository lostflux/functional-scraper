Coyuchi has been in business for more than 30 years and has set the standard for sustainable home textiles, creating the market and demand for organic luxury home goods.
Coyuchi’s sustainability mission and circular business model have proven a clear draw for customers. Over the last two years, Coyuchi’s net income has soared, with some notable highlights: $33.3 million in net sales in 2021 26% year-over-year net sales growth, while the industry average is only 5% 200,000 active customers (with more than 100% growth between 2019 and 2021) at a 35% customer repeat purchase rate Adding to its innovation beyond sustainable practices and design, Coyuchi was an early adopter of a direct-to-consumer sales and marketing approach; creating a distinct advantage over incumbents and start-up newcomers in the luxury space. This has resulted in a high lifetime value customer, luxury retail partners such as Nordstrom, and its flagship store in Marin County.
Why Now? We cannot achieve sustainability alone.
With over 30 years of operational and market knowledge of sustainable textiles, the time to raise money through the public is now.
Seventy four percent of consumers are willing to pay more for sustainable products, a pattern that has only continued to increase over the last few decades. Coyuchi’s largely millennial customer base is no exception: millennials favor ethical consumption over price when purchasing goods and services and 83% of millennials want the brands they purchase from to align with their beliefs and values ( source ). According to McKinsey, millennial spending is expected to increase to $8.3 trillion by 2025; an investment in Coyuchi highly aligns with one of the more powerful consumer groups to date.
Coyuchi is a profitable company with experienced leadership and a substantial direct-to-consumer model (over 80% of its sales are directly through coyuchi.com). Sustainable products are the fastest growing sector of the home goods market, and Coyuchi is poised for a new phase of growth as the world awakens to sustainability at scale.
The Market The overall U.S. market for home textiles is currently at $25 billion, with an expected AGR of 5% to reach $30 billion by the end of 2025, according to Statista. In 2017, Coyuchi became the first home brand to implement a take back and recycling program – called 2nd Home™.
“We believe smart investing is investing in companies that not only drive financial performance, but also focus on positive environmental and social impacts in the communities they serve. Everyone should have access to this type of investment, which is why we’re excited to launch this Regulation A+ offering,”” said Eileen Mockus, CEO & President at Coyuchi. “With this public investment, we see an incredible chance to provide greater access to living sustainably for a healthier population and world.” This round of funding will be used to grow Coyuchi’s leadership in this market through expanded marketing, product category expansion, continued physical presence, and B2B strategic partnerships with wholesalers, and online marketplaces.
Coyuchi sees the world differently.
Coyuchi believes in the democratization of finance, and wants its customers, partners, and supporters with a common interest in Coyuchi´s mission, to have first access to invest alongside VCs.
By investing through the Regulation A+ process, potential investors get access to shares in the company – an opportunity previously reserved for only the wealthiest 2%.
