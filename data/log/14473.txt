Just a few days after Google open-sourced its code for generating trippy images using artificial intelligence , you can now explore a subreddit page on social discussion board site Reddit that’s specifically devoted to sharing pictures created with DeepDream.
Reddit user UngerUnder announced the establishment of the subreddit yesterday.
 Hat tip to Will Knight of the MIT Technology Review for tweeting out a link to the subreddit this morning.
The subreddit, which goes by the name DeepDreaming, is a veritable shrine to machines tripping on data. It’s already a riot to look through.
The top spot is currently held by “The Dog Is Watching,” a patchwork of many, many dog heads and too many eyes to count.
Above: “The Dog Is Watching” Below that is “Matchstick Crane,” a tall structure decorated with dog heads. Eyes patiently look on from the sky in the background.

Over the past few days, people have been tweeting out their DeepDream creations with the hashtag #deepdream.
Flickr is chock full of DeepDream images, too. There’s even a page on the website Know Your Meme dedicated to DeepDream.
 But now people can share, explain, and critique DeepDream creations on a dedicated subreddit.
Note: Please do not hold us responsible if you throw up while viewing the images.
