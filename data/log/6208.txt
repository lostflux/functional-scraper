This fall Google will hold its Ubiquitous Computing Summit , in which it will encourage developers to create apps and services that run seamlessly across all sizes and shapes of devices.
The company announced the event (which will be held in San Francisco) during its Google I/O developers conference this afternoon.
Google has long talked about developing software that can be written once to run on many sizes of end device. These devices could include wearables, TVs, phones, or tablets.
Ubiquitous computing also stresses developing technology that’s aware of the context in which it’s being used.
SlashGear reported that Google developer advocate Timothy Jordan discussed these issues in an I/O session, then discussed the conference.
Requests for comment weren’t immediately answered by Google.
