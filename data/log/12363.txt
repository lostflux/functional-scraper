But when applied to society by Vernor Vinge, singularity means a moment beyond which huge but unpredictable changes occur.
Vinge, 58, a retired professor of computer science (from San Diego State University) and perhaps the world's most visionary science-fiction writer, believes - and has done since 1993 - that a singularity will occur when computers become intelligent enough to upgrade themselves, because their learning curve will be straight up, in the most giddy exponential fashion. In the blink of an eye, or rather in as little as 60 hours of becoming 'superhuman' - something he expects no later than the year 2030 or he'll be 'surprised' - computers could have re-modelled society and subverted laws in ways utterly bewildering to us. 'In the early post-human era, everything will be new again.' So as a scientist and mathematician he sees this singularity as a point beyond which meaningful prediction (and fiction) becomes impossible, yet nevertheless he is a science-fiction writer who tries to do that. 'Call me inconsistent - what the heck,' he says.
Vinge began writing sci-fi in the late 60s. In 1981 his novella True Names invented the concept of cyberspace, three years before William Gibson's Neuromancer was credited as doing so. Considered eerily prescient, True Names told of hackers, living for the net (addictively) who don alternate online personae to attempt to battle a worldwide artificial intelligence.
The question is whether technology will become sentient, because if the singularity is possible Vinge doubts it can be prevented. He has already imagined in his head the speech he would present in a few decades if it hasn't ('the problem of software complexity... the levelling-off of progress') and some of his stories are set in futures without computer sentience, to the chagrin of singularist fans, to whom he is almost apologetic.
'Science-fiction writers used to have it easy,' he says. 'Now it's very hard to keep up.' But if the singularity occurs as he predicts, what are some 'fictional' possibilities afterwards? Isaac Asimov's Rule 3 of robotics involved human rules being built into the superhuman computer, but Vinge at best sees machines being willing slaves (some of the time) who nevertheless direct us and do things we just don't blooming understand, distorting nature around us perhaps. He imagines us being cooperative with computers in the build-up to the singularity, or losing out - or even being extinguished. He imagines the self-awareness of the superhuman computer would not necessarily be greater in proportion than humans'. Emotions? 'I believe that emotions would still be around, though more complicated and spread across distributed systems,' he says.
Man will certainly have less and less to offer, be stripped of skills and meaningful contributions. In his near-future story Fast Times At Fairmont High, Vinge depicts humans wearing wireless-direct-mind-links and 13-year-olds making their best efforts to avoid contact with older teenagers who will be less adaptive, unable to specialise anew from day to day, plain out of touch.
The shadow of the future hangs over us, and Vinge is here to intrigue, warn and worry us about it. Maybe he will even - in his academic and imaginative ways - inspire it to happen? If the machines won't allow us to us blame them, maybe they will allow us to blame Vinge.
'The singularity marks the passing of man from centre stage,' says Vinge.
