On a sunny weekend, I sent my 7-year-old a block ahead to the playground while I helped her little brother sort out his new pedal bike. We must have taken a long time because I started getting a bunch of calls from an unknown number. When we finally caught up, my daughter was standing with a stranger and crying. He was holding his phone. ‚ÄúYou weren‚Äôt here,‚Äù he said accusingly.
‚ÄúI was 500 feet away!‚Äù I protested. It was no use. It was time for an Apple Watch.
The Apple Watch is one of the company‚Äôs most versatile (and popular) products. Some people use it for texting or as a style accessory. I mainly use mine as a fitness tracker.
 In 2020, Apple released Family Setup with WatchOS 7 , which explicitly marketed the more affordable, and older, versions of the Apple Watch to children and elderly relatives. I don‚Äôt want to give my kid an expensive cell phone that she‚Äôll use to watch YouTube Kids and then immediately lose or break. I do want her to be able to find me, and vice versa, as she exercises her growing independence.
If you have an iPhone, you probably have an old Apple Watch that you can repurpose for your older or younger family members. The Series 7 has been a game-changer for my kid. Did you want to buy a watch? Check out our guides to the Best Apple Watch or the Top Features in WatchOS 9 for more.

Apple introduced Family Setup in 2020 with WatchOS 7.
 To use Family Setup, you need an Apple Watch Series 4 or later with cellular capabilities that you will add to your cell phone plan. You also need an iPhone with iOS 14 or later.
Both you and your child also need an Apple ID.
 If both of you already have one, you can go to Settings on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac, and click Family.
 Then click Add Member.
 If your child doesn‚Äôt have an Apple ID, you will be given the option to Create Child Account.
 From there, follow the instructions to add the child‚Äôs name, birth date, and email address. If they don‚Äôt already have an email address, you can use the suggested iCloud option.
First, unpair and erase your old Apple Watch. Open the Apple Watch app on your phone and click All Watches.
 Tap the info button next to your old watch and click Unpair Apple Watch.
 You can opt to keep your cellular plan (you‚Äôll need it for your kid).
Unpairing is supposed to erase all content and settings on your watch, but in my case it did not. If it doesn‚Äôt work for you either, tap Settings on the watch, then General > Reset > Erase All Content and Settings.
Since my kid is 7, I found it easier to set the watch up on my own. But at this point, you can have your kid put it on (if it‚Äôs charged). The watch will say Bring iPhone Near Apple Watch.
 If you open the Watch app, it lets you choose to Set Up for a Family Member.
 Aim the phone‚Äôs viewfinder at the slowly moving animation to pair, or select Pair Manually.

I picked a passcode that‚Äôs easy for my daughter to remember and picked her from my family list. I continued cellular service. Then I set up all the usual features and services for an Apple Watch, including Ask to Buy so she couldn‚Äôt buy anything from the app store without my permission, Messages , and Emergency SOS.
I also chose to limit my daughter‚Äôs contacts on the watch. First, go to Settings > iCloud > Contacts on your phone and make sure it‚Äôs toggled on. Then click out, go back to Settings > Screen Time > Family Member > Communication Limits.
 You need to request your child‚Äôs permission to manage their contacts and approve it from the kid‚Äôs watch. On their watch, you can add and rename contacts from your contact list (Dad becomes ‚ÄúGrandpa,‚Äù Tim becomes ‚ÄúUncle Timmy,‚Äù and so on).
The last and most important step is turning on Schooltime , which is basically a remote-controlled version of an adult Work Focus.
 It blocks apps and complications, but emergency calls can still come through. The setup tutorial walks you through how to set up Schooltime on your child‚Äôs watch, but if you skip it during setup, you can manage it later. On your iPhone, tap All Watches > Your Child‚Äôs Watch > Schooltime > Edit Schedule.
I elected to turn Schooltime on when my child is in school and turn it off during afterschool care, but you can also click Add Time if you‚Äôd like to turn it on during a morning class, take a break for lunch, and then turn it back on again. Your kid can just turn the digital crown to exit Schooltime, but that‚Äôs OK‚Äîyou can check their Schooltime reports on your iPhone too.
To manage your child‚Äôs watch, go to your Watch > All Watches > Family Watches > Your Kid‚Äôs Apple Watch.
 This is how you install updates and manage settings, like managing the Activity app or setting up Express Transit if your child uses public transportation.
Just as with a grown-up Apple Watch , the first thing you‚Äôll probably want to do is switch the watch face. Hold down the screen and wait for the face to shrink, and swipe to switch. (You probably also want to buy a tiny kid-specific watch band.
) We got my daughter an Apple Watch so I‚Äôd be able to see her on Find My and she could contact me via phone or the Messages app, which she does with regrettable frequency (I‚Äôm hoping she gets tired of texting ‚Äúpoop‚Äù pretty soon).

 When we were at a crowded neighborhood event, we toggled Walkie Talkie on both of our Apple Watches. My daughter was able to keep in touch with me on a minute-to-minute basis. It was reassuring that she was able to reach out and say she couldn‚Äôt see me, even if she was only 10-20 feet away.
We also like the Mindfulness app, which can persuade my sensitive kid to take a deep breath before screaming about the annoying sound her brother is making. And although I explicitly wanted to get her a watch instead of a phone so that she wouldn‚Äôt stare at a screen all day, I did cave and buy her one game, Coloring Watch , which lets her choose images, fine-tune color selections, and send her creations to us.
The most useful feature she‚Äôs found on her Apple Watch has been Siri , which makes sense. She‚Äôs not allowed unfettered access to a phone, tablet, or computer, so where else can she ask questions that adults would normally type into Google? The past week, I have eavesdropped on questions as varied as: Hey Siri, what is Russia? How many stars are on the American flag? Can you show me pictures of the grossest animal? In case you were wondering, the world‚Äôs grossest animals are truly revolting. We were eating dinner, and I couldn‚Äôt even click on the pictures to find out what these animals were. That‚Äôs the thing about children, though‚Äîyou‚Äôre learning from them, even as you think they‚Äôre learning from you. Maybe if more of us used technology to relate to the world around us, instead getting away from it, we‚Äôd all be better off.
