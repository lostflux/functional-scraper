PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds is going back into a testing phase as The PUBG Corporation invites fans to try out a smaller, unfinished map codenamed “Savage.” This new level is a quarter the size of Erangel or Miramar, which are the two existing maps that are live on the servers right now. To ensure that Savage is as good as possible when it goes live, PUBG Corp. is asking for your feedback on how it plays.
To get that feedback, the studio is going to hold a closed testing phase that starts April 2 at 7 p.m. Pacific time and ends April 5 at 4 a.m. Pacific.
To get in, you’ll need a code to get access to the experimental build of PUBG. And it just so happens that I worked out a deal with some of the folks at PUBG Corp. to give a handful of keys to some of my closest friends and family — that means you.
How to get a key for the PUBG Savage test You have three ways to get a key from us at GamesBeat.
Event GamesBeat at the Game Awards We invite you to join us in LA for GamesBeat at the Game Awards event this December 7. Reserve your spot now as space is limited! Method 1 We’ll hand out keys across some of our social channels, so follow us on these platforms for a chance to get one: GamesBeat on Twitter VentureBeat on Facebook Method 2 A better way to get a key is to show up tonight to watch the PUBG Family Dinner on Twitch.
 On most Friday nights, I play PUBG with a community of killers and wily survivors. During the stream tonight, you will have a chance to win a key by following my Twitch channel and watching live. Here are the details: Follow the Twitch home of the PUBG Family Dinner The Family Dinner starts at 8 p.m. Pacific time.
