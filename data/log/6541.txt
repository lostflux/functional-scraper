Developer Volition is bringing its superpowered crime game to the new consoles.
The studio confirmed that Saints Row IV: Re-elected debuts Jan. 27 for Xbox One and PlayStation 4 for $30. During its panel at the Penny Arcade Expo in Seattle, Volition said that it is porting its critically acclaimed over-the-top action game to the latest hardware from Sony and Microsoft. This could potentially expose the game to an entirely new audience who maybe missed the game on PC or older systems.
Volition did provide one detail; the new version will support voice commands. Yelling obscenities at the screen will actually benefit your character. This is good news for me, since that’s just how I normally play.
Saints Row IV originally debuted in 2013 on Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and PC. It has players taking control of the boss of the Saints gang (who is also the President of the United States), who must save the world from an alien invasion. As part of their plot to control Earth, the alien invaders imprison humanity in a digital world that actually enables players to acquire Matrix -like super powers.

In addition to Saints Row IV, Volition also announced a new $20 standalone expansion called Gat Out of Hell that will have the Saints gang taking on Satan.
