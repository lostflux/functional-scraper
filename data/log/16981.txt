Amazon Web Services today unveiled DeepLens, a wireless video camera made for the quick deployment of deep learning. The camera will cost $249 and is scheduled to ship for customers in the United States in April 2018.
DeepLens comes pre-loaded with AWS Greengrass for local computation and can operate with SageMaker , a new service to simplify the deployment of AI models, as well as popular open source AI services such as TensorFlow from Google and Caffe2 from Facebook, according to an AWS blog.
“DeepLens runs the model directly onto the device. The video doesn’t have to go anywhere. It can be trained with SageMaker and deployed to the model,” said AWS general manager of AI services Matt Wood during the keynote address today at AWS re:Invent conference being held this week in Las Vegas.

The camera can run pre-trained or custom AI models to perform computer vision tasks such as facial recognition, sentiment analysis, or object identification. Pre-trained models included with the camera can also recognize a variety of activities such as brushing teeth or playing the guitar.
“You can program this thing to do almost anything you can imagine so you can imagine programming the camera with computer vision models so if you recognize a license plate coming into your driveway it will open a garage door, or you can program an alarm if your dog gets on the couch,” said AWS CEO Andy Jassy onstage.
DeepLens includes a 4-megapixel camera for 1080p video and two microphones, as well as 8GB of RAM and 16GB of storage space for videos, pre-trained models, and code.
DeepLens made its debut Wednesday together with a barrage of computer vision and natural language processing services from AWS to help developers deliver AI services in the cloud.
