It’s time to punch zombies so hard that they go flying into the air.
Developer Techland says it is planning a special event for its zombie survival game Dying Light. Starting at midnight Pacific time and running through until 11:49 p.m. Pacific tomorrow, Dying Light gets an update with a “bad batch” of the in-game pharmaceutical Antizin that gives you some pretty messed up powers … or at least that’s what Techland claims. No one would blame you for not believing this is actually real since tomorrow is April Fools’ Day.
But we’ve got confirmation from Techland’s public relations that it is really going through with this.
The bad-batch event is all about giving players crazy abilities. The biggest change is to the physics. Players affected by the spoiled Antizin can send zombies flying through the air like they weigh nothing at all with nothing but a punch. It sounds like a pretty good time.
