Photograph: Ben Hider/Getty Artificial intelligence (AI) IBM computer Watson wins Jeopardy clash and agencies The 1984 film The Terminator foretold of an epic battle between man and machine, each striving for dominance. Little did the writers know how prescient their tale would be.
Fast-forward to 2011 and non-fictional humans are pitting their wits against a supercomputer – although this time in an effort to win US quiz show Jeopardy , rather than guarantee the survival of humanity.
Ken Jennings, the 74-time winner of the popular trivia quiz, and Brad Rutter, a 20-time champion, have gone head-to-hard-drive with an IBM supercomputer called Watson three times in the past three days. Unlike in The Terminator, they lost each time.
The supercomputer, named after former International Business Machines corporation president Thomas Watson, is a showcase of the company's expertise in advanced science and computing.
Watson showed off its encyclopedic knowledge of topics ranging from ancient languages to fashion design, along with a few glitches.
"Vedic, dating back at least 4,000 years, is the earliest dialect of this classical language of India," was one of the clues given by host Alex Trebek.
"What is Sanskrit?" Watson answered in the show's question-as-an-answer style, before going on to solve clues ranging from agricultural policy in the European Union to the designer Marc Jacobs.
The latest challenge shows that IBM – which turns 100 this year – wants to stay at the forefront of the information technology industry, despite apparently being usurped by companies such as Google and Apple.
What makes Watson particularly advanced, even compared with Deep Blue, IBM's chess-playing supercomputer that beat world champion Garry Kasparov in 1997, is its ability to find answers from ambiguous clues, such as this one: "It's a poor workman who blames these." "What are tools?" answered Watson.
Watson was not perfect, however, and made some baffling errors such as coming up with "Dorothy Parker" instead of "The Elements of Style" and repeating other contestants' mistakes.
In the end, Watson won with $77,147 (£47,812), while Jennings, who won 74 games in a row during the show's 2004-2005 season, came in second with $24,000. Brad Rutter, who has in previous appearances won a total of $3.3m, followed with $21,600. IBM plans to donate Watson's winnings to charity.
"I, for one, welcome our new computer overlords," Jennings wrote next to his last answer, displaying one human quality conspicuously absent in Watson – a sense of humour.
The New York-based company Armonk spends about $6bn a year on research and development. An unspecified part of that goes to what it calls grand challenges, or big, multiyear science projects such as Watson and Deep Blue.
IBM plans to use Watson's linguistic and analytical abilities to develop products in areas such as medical diagnosis.
Jennings and Rutter managed to beat Watson in Final Jeopardy: they knew which city's largest airport is named after a second world war hero and second-largest after a second world war battle. While the human players responded with "What is Chicago?", Watson demonstrated its confusion with five question marks after its response of "What Is Toronto?????".
