Heroes never die, and Overwatch will give 32 teams a chance at immortality this week.
Starting August 24, FaceIt and Eleague will kick off the Overwatch Open North American and European playoffs as part of a contest worth $100,000. Each region will host 16 teams, and the top 4 from across North America and Europe will then combine with another 12 that qualified through their point standings throughout the qualifiers will form the final 16. Eleague and FaceIt will broadcast coverage of the event on the Overwatch Open Twitch channel as it attempts to establish the competitive-gaming community of the popular team-based shooter.
