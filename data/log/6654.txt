BlueRun Ventures, of Waze and PayPal fame, is raising a new $150M fund, according to a public SEC filing.
This new round will follow a previous fund of the same size , which was expected to close during the first quarter of 2014, according to the Wall Street Journal.
It’s unclear if BlueRun’s previous round did in fact close earlier this year. BlueRun refused VentureBeat’s request for comment by phone.
BlueRun’s experience in the mobile sector is extensive. The firm’s first fund, backed by Nokia, dates back to 1998.
 Additional noteworthy exits include Topsy and Chomp.
 Current portfolio companies include Banjo and Kabbage.
