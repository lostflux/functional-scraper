If there were a stronger word than ‚Äúcrushed,‚Äù I would use it, but Apple commands more than 36 percent of the smartwatch market.
Among the shrinking group of smartwatch-wearing customers that have eluded Apple, one of them is me. I can‚Äôt commit to an Apple Watch, especially with its 18-hour battery life. When you have hobbies like multiday backcountry camping, snowboarding, and climbing, it makes no sense to wear a relatively fragile device that‚Äôs going to die in less than a day‚Äîespecially when there are more-rugged, longer-lasting options.
Garmin‚Äôs tough, expensive watches dominate the premium watch category , which includes devices costing $500 or more. Over the past few years, Apple has made several tentative moves in Garmin‚Äôs direction by adding features that the more extreme outdoorsy folks would need. The Series 7 was the most dustproof and durable Apple Watch, with algorithm updates for features like improved fall detection. Earlier this year, Apple announced new features in WatchOS 9 ‚Äîlike being able to detect running mechanics‚Äîthat make it more useful to endurance athletes.

It has double the battery life, a dual-satellite system, a red-hued night mode that doesn‚Äôt ruin the wearer‚Äôs night vision, and a new action button painted international orange. The question remains: Would Maverick or Rooster wear an Apple Watch to Top Gun? The answer, I think, is still no.
The first feature that bears commenting on is its size. It has a 49-mm case. That‚Äôs almost two full inches! On your wrist! It‚Äôs made from aerospace-grade titanium, with a flat sapphire crystal display designed to withstand serious impacts. That new action button on the side is customizable to provide instant access to specific features you want to call up with a single press, like the compass. The button itself is also big and is designed to be used with gloves on.

For example, a new onboard precision dual-frequency GPS system is designed to help you pinpoint your satellite location, even in environments like cities full of skyscrapers or forests full of tall trees that normally block satellite signals‚Äîsomething that‚Äôs historically been a problem for, example, events like running a marathon through a big city.
This GPS system goes hand in hand with a host of navigational features. The compass app has been redesigned, with a new hybrid view that shows both the analog dial and a digital view, and turning the digital crown lets you see your latitude, longitude, and elevation. Features like Backtrack are a direct ripoff of Garmin‚Äôs breadcrumb feature, which lets you retrace your steps when you inevitably wander off the hiking trail to pee and get sadly lost in the backcountry.

This being Apple, I also must mention the accessories. The Ultra comes with one of three new bands: a soft, thin, flexible Trail loop band; an Alpine band with high-strength yarn and a titanium G-hook fastener; and an Ocean band made from a flexible fluoroelastomer, again with a titanium buckle. And of course, the Ultra has been certified to the MIL-STD-810H standard for military equipment, with testing against factors like low and high temperatures, sand and dust, shock, and more.
The Ultra is also designed to become a full-on wrist-worn dive computer. It meets recreational dive standards for waterproofing and has a new depth gauge. When it debuts this fall, the Oceanic+ app (designed in partnership with Huish Outdoors) will let divers see a decompression timetable, dive planning, a logbook, and other features serious divers need. Apple‚Äôs foray into water sports might seem incongruous, unless you already knew that Garmin makes two of the most popular dive and sailing wearables, the Descent and the Quatix.
There are also some features that aren‚Äôt exclusive to the Ultra‚Äîthey‚Äôll be on the other new Apple Watches, and most existing watches when watchOS 9 rolls out on September 12‚Äîsuch as vertical oscillation and running power for runners, body temperature sensing, and car crash detection.
The Ultra‚Äôs $799 price seems expensive until you realize that a similar offering from Garmin, the Fenix 7 , costs $1,000‚Äîand doesn‚Äôt even seamlessly transmit audio calls from your iPhone! The watch has some built-in and app-enabled features just for ocean divers.
Photograph: Apple These features certainly make the Ultra an appealing alternative for the Garmin faithful, were it not for two big blockers. Those of us with smaller wrists are put off by the 49-mm case size, which is certainly big. While the comparable G-Shock comes in case sizes as large as 55 mm, Garmin has been moving toward smaller, slimmer watches for some time, like the Garmin Instinct 2S Solar.
Gear The Best Home Depot Black Friday Deals Matt Jancer Gear 16 Early Black Friday Deals From Walmart Matt Jancer Gear The Best Early Black Friday Deals We've Found Nena Farrell Gear The Best Amazon Black Friday Deals Louryn Strampe The second blocker is of course the battery life: 36 hours per charge is exceptionally long‚Äîfor an Apple Watch. The Ultra‚Äôs battery can last up to 60 hours in a low-power setting (that will debut this fall with a software update), but it reduces the frequency with which the watch checks your heart rate and pings the satellite systems. But 60 hours is a mere 2.5 days. That‚Äôs not even as long as a tame weekend backpacking trip, let alone an alpine expedition or a live-aboard boat dive.
Photograph: Apple While the Ultra‚Äôs battery life is a significant improvement for the Apple Watch line, it‚Äôs still not enough for lovers of off-grid living. The one feature that all rugged explorers want out of a mission-critical device is a guarantee that it won‚Äôt be compromised‚Äîor worse, turn off‚Äîwhen you‚Äôre out there, miles and miles away from help. As long as Apple can‚Äôt guarantee that won‚Äôt happen, the Ultra is exciting but most likely just something that appeals to weekend warriors. Solar charging would be one improvement, as many explorer-focused watches now offer it. Other battery improvements that could get the Ultra to stay alive for longer than just a few days would be welcome too.

But it‚Äôs getting closer.
