DotData , a San Mateo, California-based provider of automation tools that operationalize data science processes, today announced it has raised $23 million in a series A funding round led by JAFCO, with participation from Goldman Sachs. The fresh capital brings its total raised to $43 million, following a $20 million seed round in April 2018. CEO Ryohei Fujimaki said the funds will bolster the company’s ongoing sales, marketing, and product development efforts.
“We are pleased with the confidence our investors show in our vision, team, product, and ability to execute and expand market share,” said Fujimaki, who founded DotData in 2018 with Kusumura Yukitaka, Masato Asahara, and Yusuke Muraoka. “Our company’s rapid growth over the past 18 months signals a significant market demand for our unique data science automation platform. These funds will enable us to accelerate product development and innovation to continue bringing transformational value to our customers.” DotData, a spinoff of NEC, offers a no-code platform that leverages machine learning to clean, normalize, aggregate, and combine data sets while performing feature engineering. It autonomously transforms hundreds of database tables and billions of rows, expediting laborious work that would otherwise have to be undertaken manually. It furthermore generates AI scoring pipelines in production that integrate with existing workflows, ensuring repeatability. And it develops dotDataPy, a Python library that kicks off end-to-end workloads with only a few lines of code.
DotData hasn’t disclosed the names of any customers, but it claims its products are used by Fortune 500 companies “around the world” and that revenue grew 300% in the past year.
