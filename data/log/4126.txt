Duolink SpeakerBuds’ stereo speakers also offer high-quality sound on both sides of a room, up to 22 feet.

Crafted using medical silicone for the ultimate in ear comfort, for all-day wear, SpeakerBuds’ shark fin earbuds with internally tapered tips ensure they fit snugly. Tap control allows users to easily adjust volume, pick up or hang up calls and activate a voice assistant, to summon Siri, all at their fingertips.
