Catch a #NintendoDirectNA about #WiiU & #3DS games on 4/1 at 3 p.m. PT. Don’t let the date fool you: This is no joke! pic.twitter.com/alsJ5Ty5b0 — Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) March 31, 2015 While we’ll probably see announced games like Star Fox and Splatoon, Nintendo will likely unveil new software at the event. The company should be eager to give fans something new to look forward to after delaying the anticipated Wii U installment of The Legend of Zelda to 2016.
