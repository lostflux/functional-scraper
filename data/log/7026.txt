It said the deal with OpenAI would involve deploying the company’s artificial intelligence models across Microsoft products, which include the Bing search engine and its office software such as Word, PowerPoint and Outlook.
ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence chatbot, has been a sensation since it launched in November, with users marvelling at its ability to perform a variety of tasks from writing recipes and sonnets to job applications.
It is at the forefront of generative AI, or technology trained on vast amounts of text and images that can create content from a simple text prompt.
It has also been described as “a gamechanger” that will challenge teachers in universities and schools amid concerns that pupils are already using the chatbot to write high-quality essays with minimal human input.
In a blogpost announcing “the third phase” of its partnership, Microsoft said the investment would include additional supercomputer development and cloud-computing support for OpenAI via Microsoft’s Azure platform.
It has been previously reported that Microsoft was considering a $10bn (£8bn) investment in OpenAI this time round.
“We formed our partnership with OpenAI around a shared ambition to responsibly advance cutting-edge AI research and democratise AI as a new technology platform,” said Satya Nadella, Microsoft’s chairman and chief executive.
“In this next phase of our partnership, developers and organisations across industries will have access to the best AI infrastructure, models, and toolchain with Azure to build and run their applications.” Sign up to TechScape Free weekly newsletter Alex Hern's weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our lives Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

after newsletter promotion Monday’s announcement is Microsoft’s third investment in San Francisco-based OpenAI, which was co-founded by Elon Musk and the investor Sam Altman. As part of the investments, Microsoft has since built a supercomputer to power OpenAI’s technology, among other forms of support.
Dan Ives, analyst at the US financial services firm Wedbush Securities, said: “With ChatGPT being one of the most innovative AI technologies seen in the industry, [Microsoft] is clearly being aggressive on this front and not going to be left behind on what could be a potential gamechanging AI investment.
“In the AI race today, Nadella & Co are ahead of the rest of Big Tech and this investment is a major notch on the AI belt.” Explore more on these topics Artificial intelligence (AI) Microsoft Computing Chatbots ChatGPT news More on this story More on this story Microsoft accused of damaging Guardian’s reputation with AI-generated poll 31 Oct 2023 Microsoft completes $69bn deal to buy Call of Duty maker Activision Blizzard 13 Oct 2023 CMA to investigate UK cloud computing market amid Microsoft and Amazon concerns 5 Oct 2023 UK set to clear Microsoft’s deal to buy Call of Duty maker Activision Blizzard 22 Sept 2023 Microsoft submits new Activision Blizzard deal to win over UK regulator 22 Aug 2023 UK’s CMA to hear more views on Microsoft’s Activision Blizzard deal 31 Jul 2023 CMA is in danger of securing pyrrhic victory in Call of Duty battle 17 Jul 2023 Will Microsoft be able to close $69bn deal for Activision Blizzard? 13 Jul 2023 Microsoft may proceed with $69bn Activision Blizzard deal, judge rules 11 Jul 2023 Microsoft appeals against UK watchdog’s veto of Activision Blizzard takeover 24 May 2023 Most viewed Most viewed US World Environment US Politics Ukraine Soccer Business Tech Science Newsletters Wellness News Opinion Sport Culture Lifestyle About us Help Complaints & corrections SecureDrop Work for us Privacy policy Cookie policy Terms & conditions Contact us All topics All writers Digital newspaper archive Facebook YouTube Instagram LinkedIn Twitter Newsletters Advertise with us Guardian Labs Search jobs Back to top
