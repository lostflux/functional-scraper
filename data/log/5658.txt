The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim originally came out in 2011 for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC. Now, Bethesda has released a new Special Edition with improved graphics for the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

The Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 were already aging consoles by then, and Skyrim on the PC had far more options designed for high-end rigs. Five years later, can a console version finally compete? Digital Foundry , which specializes in graphical comparisons, has released a new video on its YouTube channel comparing the new, PlayStation 4 version of Skyrim with the original release on PC (not the new Special Edition on PC).
