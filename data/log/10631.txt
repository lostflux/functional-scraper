Prior to this, I’ve completed a B.A. in Computational Linguistics at the University of Heidelberg, Germany and visited Trinity College, Dublin and the University of Copenhagen, Denmark. I’ve also worked with Microsoft, IBM’s Extreme Blue, Google Summer of Code, and SAP, among others.
I am mainly interested in developing models that can learn useful aspects of language from few examples and to create representations with prior knowledge that can help with this. In my research, I have focused on different aspects of transfer learning for NLP: domain adaptation, multi-task learning, semi-supervised learning, and cross-lingual learning. I am passionate about making ML more accessible. I enjoy writing and am blogging occasionally to share what I’ve learned.
