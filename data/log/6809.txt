Erik Jorgensen, General Manager Local Advertising at Microsoft Schwark Satyavolu, Global Head Rewards and Offers at MasterCard Card-linked offers stand at the unique intersection of the payments, social media, advertising, and retail industries. As the “offers” space has become more popular, consumers have often found it cumbersome to take advantage of the variety and amount of offers available. Card-linked offers help solve that problem by giving merchants and advertisers the ability to deliver an offer or deal to consumers via their credit, debit or other payment cards without having to use a paper coupon, voucher or promotion code.
