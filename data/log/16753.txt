Our GamesBeat Summit 2019 is over, but that doesn’t mean we can’t go back to the lessons we learned — or heed them for the first time. Storied strategy game designer Chris Taylor talked about his new cloud gaming platform.
 We examined how to better navigate China’s game market (something that’s becoming more complex by the year), and how to apply the lessons of dealing with online gamers in the late 1990s and 2000s to today’s communities. We looked at esports, investing, and influencers.
And you can see everything that we discussed during Day Two here.
 And you can catch our Day One videos here.
GamesBeat has gathered videos of all the second day’s sessions from our Twitch and YouTube livestreams.
