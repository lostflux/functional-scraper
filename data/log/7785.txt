The program, DALL-E , released earlier this month, can concoct images of all sorts of weird things that don't exist, like avocado armchairs, robot giraffes, or radishes wearing tutus. OpenAI generated several images, including the spaghetti knight, at WIRED‚Äôs request.
DALL-E is a version of GPT-3 , an AI model trained on text scraped from the web that‚Äôs capable of producing surprisingly coherent text. DALL-E was fed images and accompanying descriptions; in response, it can generate a decent mashup image.
Images created by DALL-E in response to ‚Äúan illustration of a baby daikon radish in a tutu walking a dog.‚Äù Courtesy of OpenAI Pranksters were quick to see the funny side of DALL-E, noting for instance that it can imagine new kinds of British food. But DALL-E is built on an important advance in AI-powered computer vision , one that could have serious, and practical, applications.
Called CLIP , it consists of a vast artificial neural network ‚Äîan algorithm inspired by the way the brain learns‚Äîfed hundreds of millions of images and accompanying text captions from the web and trained to predict the correct labels for an image.
Researchers at OpenAI found that CLIP could recognize objects as accurately as algorithms trained in the usual way‚Äîusing curated data sets where images are neatly matched to labels.
As a result, CLIP can recognize more things, and it can grasp what certain things look like without needing copious examples. CLIP helped DALL-E produce its artwork, automatically selecting the best images from the ones it generated. OpenAI has released a paper describing how CLIP works as well as a small version of the resulting program. It has yet to release a paper or any code for DALL-E.
By Tom Simonite Both DALL-E and CLIP are ‚Äúsuper impressive,‚Äù says Karthik Narasimhan , an assistant professor at Princeton specializing in computer vision. He says CLIP builds upon previous work that has sought to train large AI models using images and text simultaneously, but does so at an unprecedented scale. ‚ÄúCLIP is a large-scale demonstration of being able to use more natural forms of supervision‚Äîthe way that we talk about things,‚Äù he says.
He says CLIP could be commercially useful in many ways, from improving the image recognition used in web search and video analytics, to making robots or autonomous vehicles smarter. CLIP could be used as the starting point for an algorithm that lets robots learn from images and text, such as instruction manuals, he says. Or it could help a self-driving car recognize pedestrians or trees in an unfamiliar setting.

The company has collected images from millions of kilometers of autonomous driving, he says, but it‚Äôs sometimes difficult to find a particular image that could help in training. He says the algorithm could help him search through the data using a text prompt. ‚ÄúBeing able to describe what you are looking for can be very helpful during development,‚Äù he says.
Some AI programmers and hackers have begun experimenting with CLIP using the code released by OpenAI. Justin Pinkney, a deep-learning consultant and the creator of Toonify , an app that uses AI to convert photos of people into cartoon caricatures, calls the program ‚Äúvery impressive‚Äù and ‚Äúextremely versatile.‚Äù He says CLIP could prove useful to build a data set of images for a specific task, and he says he wants to see if it can help guide AI systems that generate imagery. ‚ÄúIt's pretty astonishing that it seems to have learned things like what celebrities look like, what characterizes different styles of painting and artists,‚Äù he says.

He says he wishes OpenAI would also release code for DALL-E, but he adds, ‚ÄúI have a feeling they won't.‚Äù Ilya Sutskever, chief scientist at OpenAI, says there may be commercial applications, but the company is currently focused on research. OpenAI has not decided whether it will release the full version of either program.
Andrei Barbu , a research scientist at MIT‚Äôs Center for Brains, Minds, and Machines who studies computer vision and AI, thinks CLIP may prove useful in commercial settings. He says it would be especially useful for cases where it is impractical to create lots of labeled images for training.
Barbu is also frustrated that OpenAI has not yet released the full version of CLIP, or any of the code for DALL-E‚Äîcontinuing a trend among some of the more prominent commercial AI labs. ‚ÄúIt's a little awkward from the point of view of researchers,‚Äù Barbu says. ‚ÄúA lot of these amazing things come out, but none of us can actually do anything with them, none of us can build anything on top of them, nor can we even reproduce them.‚Äù üì© Want the latest on tech, science, and more?
