One of the cool features in Amazon’s Fire phone is Firefly , which can recognize images, movies, or music in the real world and launch related Web content on your phone.
The Los Angeles-based startup NantMobile has a technology platform that can put that capability on any mobile device via an app.
The company has now raised $50 million for the platform from an unknown investor or investors, according to an SEC filing.
Calls to the company were not returned Friday.
NantMobile’s software platform lets marketers and media outlets bridge the gap between the real and digital worlds. Using the NantMobile app, a user can aim the camera at a poster, advertisement, or at a piece of product packaging. Then your mobile device will launch some related content, like demonstration video for marketers or extended coverage for media.
The app can also listen to music or movies and identify the content, then launch related content.
NantMobile is one of two subsidiaries of a parent company called NantWorks, which is run by serial entrepreneur Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong. The other is a health startup called NantBioscience.
