They’ll be launching from the same part of NASA’s Kennedy Center in Florida that saw the liftoff of so many historic Apollo and space shuttle missions, but they’ll be aboard a different kind of spaceflight: the first all-civilian, all-private mission into orbit.
This new spaceflight, dubbed Inspiration4 , will propel the crew into low Earth orbit at an altitude of some 350 miles above the planet. They’ll fly much higher than Jeff Bezos and Richard Branson did during their flights with Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic earlier this summer, and even above the International Space Station.
 While this year’s private flights have signaled a new era of commercial space travel, allowing more people access to space, they’re drawing both praise and more scrutiny of how their crew members are picked.
By Ramin Skibba “There have only been 570-odd people that have been to space. Up until now, we’ve thought about them as the elite, the exceptional, and the overly wealthy,” says Mike Mongo, who literally wrote The Astronaut Instruction Manual.
“Now people are going to imagine that they are themselves going to space, because we see ourselves in the crew of Inspiration4.” Lucianne Walkowicz, cofounder of JustSpace Alliance , a nonprofit advocating for a more inclusive and ethical future in space, disagrees. “I don’t think private companies are inherently making space more accessible. You have a very opaque selection process that is fitting a heavily constructed narrative about what kinds of qualities we should have in astronauts,” Walkowicz says. Making people compete on social media to be astronauts ensures that the selection process will be inequitable, they say.
Jared Isaacman is the mission commander. The billionaire CEO of the payment processing company Shift4Payments also happens to have substantial aviation experience, including as the founder of Draken International, a private Air Force training program. Sian Proctor, a geoscientist, artist, and science communicator who has completed four simulated NASA space missions, has the title of pilot. She will also become just the fourth African American woman to go to space. (Mae Jemison was the first, in 1992.) While the space capsule is mostly autonomous, Proctor and Isaacman would be able to pilot it if they lose contact with mission control.
The rest of the Inspiration4 quartet includes Chris Sembroski, an aeronautical engineer, Air Force veteran, and former US Space Camp counselor. The final spot goes to Hayley Arceneaux, who at age 29 will be one of the youngest astronauts ever. (Soviet cosmonaut Gherman Titov orbited Earth at age 25, and Bezos’ much shorter flight included 18-year-old Oliver Daemen.
) She is a bone cancer survivor and was once a patient at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, a nonprofit based in Memphis, Tennessee, where she now works as a physician assistant. She also will be the first space traveler with a prosthetic body part, one that replaces most of her left femur.

They’re bringing along scientific equipment that Arceneaux and others will use to study the health effects of space radiation and extremely low levels of gravity. (Radiation can damage DNA and lead to cancer; NASA is in the process of setting new exposure limits for astronauts.
) Proctor plans to spend time on her art and poetry, while Sembroski will entertain the crew with his ukulele. The whole voyage will take about three days, and at the end of the trip, the spacecraft will descend, protected by a heat shield and slowed by a parachute, to splash down in either the Gulf or Atlantic side of Florida, likely late Saturday night or early on Sunday. The newly minted astronauts will then be retrieved from the floating capsule by a team of SpaceX personnel.
Jordan Bimm, a space historian at the University of Chicago, notes that the flight will include a number of historic firsts and oddities. Despite Isaacman’s and Proctor’s piloting experience, this will also be the first orbital flight without a pilot with the traditional kind of background that, say, Neil Armstrong and Alan Shepard had. But the cultural idea of the pilot persists, Bimm says: The crew members will wear flight suits and have call signs. Also, he notes, “this will be the first orbital flight since 2009 to not go to the space station.” (That 2009 mission involved repairing the Hubble Space Telescope.)

Bezos' and Branson’s flights breached the very edge of space, near what’s known as the Kármán Line, about 60 miles above the Earth. While they ventured into space for a few minutes, Isaacman and his team will travel about six times higher and orbit for several days—a much bigger and potentially riskier undertaking.
Todd “Leif” Ericson, an Inspiration4 mission director who won’t be on the flight itself, is cognizant of the backlash against Bezos’ and Branson’s flights, decried by some as “ joyrides.
” Commentators criticized those two flights because Bezos and Branson, both billionaires and owners of their respective companies, themselves took the first seats available. The flights arguably had little scientific value, beyond merely showing it could be done. Their space race, which included spats over who went first and who went highest, occurred in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic and a climate crisis, and at a time of extreme economic inequality. For some critics, it simply wasn’t a worthwhile use of resources.
Elon Musk, SpaceX’s billionaire owner, won’t be flying on Inspiration4. Instead, Isaacman approached SpaceX last fall as the company was planning its first all-civilian flight. He became the first crew member essentially by purchasing the entire mission: He bought all four seats. Then he bought a Super Bowl ad, inviting people to throw their hats in the ring for two of the other spots. One of them was offered via a lottery-like drawing for people who made contributions to St. Jude. That produced a ticket for a close friend of Sembroski’s, who suggested he take his place. To compete for the other seat, people were invited to post a video on Twitter about their entrepreneurial story. The top entries were reviewed by a panel of judges, who awarded it to Proctor. (Proctor serves on the board of JustSpace Alliance, and Mongo helped coach her application.) Isaacman reserved the final for a worker at St. Jude.
“Jared wants to explore and push the boundaries toward becoming an interplanetary species, but he wants to make sure we’re taking care of things back on Earth,” says Ericson, noting that Isaacman has played a role in the mission's efforts to raise at least $200 million for St. Jude’s cancer research. (The crew will be carrying aboard 50 NFTs, made by the platform Origin Protocol, which will be auctioned after liftoff, with proceeds going to the hospital.)

To Walkowicz, the heavy social media component of the selection process, while understandable from SpaceX’s perspective, could be problematic. “We’re all very much aware of the ways social media enhances existing biases, where people conform to gendered and racialized norms,” they say.
And while government astronauts aren’t the only space travelers anymore, tickets on today’s private space flights seem to be reserved for the wealthy, or for friends who are dependent on their generosity, Bimm says: “Space remains a very elite place; it’s just that the type of the elite person is changing.” Still, although this spaceflight is often described as an “all-civilian” one, most of the participants aren’t so unlike astronauts who have gone through NASA’s traditional process. “Isaacman, Sembroski, and Proctor have all devoted decades of their lives to flight and space-related professional development and experience, so they haven’t exactly waltzed into this,” wrote Kathryn Denning, an anthropologist and space ethics researcher at York University in Toronto, in an email to WIRED.
Arcenaux has less experience than the others, but they’ve all been training for the mission since March. “It’s a very intense training program,” says Scott “Kidd” Poteet, who along with Ericson directs the Inspiration4 mission. “They’ve gone through hours upon hours of simulator training, including operations of the Dragon capsule. It included fighter jet training, including experiencing g-forces, and climbing Mount Rainier. It’s been a challenging environment and conditions, and they’ve done nothing but succeed.” Arcenaux’s prosthesis no longer counts as the barrier it once might have been to spaceflight. This spring, the European Space Agency began recruiting, for the first time, astronauts with physical disabilities; some space experts note that prosthetics can be advantageous in zero-G.
For NASA, encouraging the burgeoning space industry has been part of the plan, especially since the shuttle program ended in 2011. NASA invested in commercial crew providers a decade ago—SpaceX and Boeing—anticipating that companies would be able to deliver astronauts to the space station and presumably launch others into space as well. In May 2020, SpaceX’s Crew Dragon carried two NASA astronauts to the ISS and brought them home again in a historic first for public-private missions.

Buy tickets and go,” he said at Tuesday’s press briefing. While Inspiration4’s passengers went through astronaut-like training, in the future, he said, “we’ll want to cut back on training while ensuring safety.” During their time in orbit, the Inspiration4 crew will be released from gravity, and they’ll have the life-changing experience of viewing our own small world from far above. Unlike NASA astronauts, they’ll have their own personal goals and interests to pursue while in orbit. In the movie adaptation of Carl Sagan’s novel Contact , the protagonist, played by Jodie Foster, gazes at an alien world for the first time and says in awe: “ They should have sent a poet.
