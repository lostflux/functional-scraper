The competition is huge and plentiful when it comes to audio headsets, especially when it comes to gaming. That’s why SteelSeries is refreshing its lineup of Siberia headsets for gamers today.
If you want to stay competitive in this space, you have to come up with a new cool product frequently. This year, the Copenhagen, Denmark-based SteelSeries is launching several new headsets in its Siberia family. The SteelSeries Siberia v3 costs $100, and it is redesigned with a new audio driver technology. The company says they deliver rich, detailed sound with powerful bass. It has noise-reducing memory-foam ear cushions that provide more sound isolation than in the past.
The headset has a single-plug cable along with a dual-jack extension for use on all types of gaming devices from PCs to laptops, mobile devices, and consoles. It comes in black or white. I had an in-person demo of the headset, and it sounded good to me. When you have it on, you don’t even notice when someone else is talking to you. The device hangs the headset from a suspension system that makes the headset quite flexible.
“For us, Siberia is the definition of what gaming audio looks, feels and sounds like. When it was first introduced, Siberia delivered a sense of style that was unique to what was typically expected from gaming audio. It produced exactly what was, and is necessary – ‘forget-that-you’re-wearing-it’ comfort and great sound,” said Tino Soelberg, SteelSeries chief technology officer, in a statement. “The new Siberia family takes this foundation and extends it into a full product range that delivers an incredibly awesome audio experience for the gamer in everyone” Event GamesBeat at the Game Awards We invite you to join us in LA for GamesBeat at the Game Awards event this December 7.

It has unlimited profile settings that can be saved and accessed from anywhere via SteelSeries CloudSync. It has microphone noise suppression and microphone auto compression.
The third headset is the Siberia Elite Prism, which also costs $200. This is an upgrade with a new industrial design with a slimmer microphone and an upgraded sound card improve the clarity of what you hear and how your voice is heard. Its ear cushions are designed to be comfortable for longer gaming sessions. It delivers Dolby Headphone and Dolby Pro Logic IIx technologies for a virtual 7.2-channel surround sound effect. It has a swappable cable so it can be used across PC, Mac, PS4, and mobile devices. The original Elite was launched last year.
The final headset is the Siberia Raw Prism, a $60 product designed to make the Siberia brand more accessible to a wider set of gamers.
