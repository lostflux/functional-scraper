Photograph: Juanmonino/Getty Images Save this story Save Save this story Save When ChatGPT ‚Äîthe ingenious, garrulous, and occasionally unhinged chatbot from OpenAI ‚Äîwas asked this week how much the company behind it is worth, its responses included: ‚ÄúIt is likely that its worth is in the hundreds of millions of dollars, if not more.‚Äù Microsoft, which is rumored to be weighing a $10 billion investment in OpenAI on top of an earlier $1 billion commitment, is betting that the company is worth a lot more‚Äîdespite the fact neither ChatGPT nor other AI models made by OpenAI are yet raking in huge amounts of cash. OpenAI has built several impressive and attention-grabbing demos and powers a popular autocomplete function for coders offered by Microsoft‚Äôs GitHub. But despite the hype swirling around its technology, the startup hasn‚Äôt created a breakout, highly lucrative product or business.
‚ÄúWe don't really know what ChatGPT is going to be great at,‚Äù says James Cham, a partner at Bloomberg Beta , an investment firm. But while the bot‚Äôs path to riches may not be clear, Cham shares the feeling of many VCs and entrepreneurs that the technology behind the bot will pay out in a big way. OpenAI‚Äôs technology is at the heart of a swell of interest in so-called generative AI , a term encompassing algorithms that can generate text, images, or other data.
Cham compares the current situation to the early days of the internet, when some obscure but evocative demos turned out to precede a sea change in the workings of software, tech companies, and wider society. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve had decades of great AI demos, but this is the first one where you give it to someone and they are really excited about the possibilities,‚Äù Cham says of ChatGPT.
OpenAI‚Äôs chatbot took the internet by storm when it was released in December 2022 , demonstrating an uncanny ability to answer questions and perform tricks like crafting mostly coherent essays, producing working computer code, and musing on the meaning of life. It is powered by GPT-3, a text-generation algorithm developed by OpenAI , that has been fed huge quantities of text slurped from the web and other sources and then given additional training on how to answer questions.
Some developers were so inspired by ChatGPT that they quickly used it to create apps, such as a spreadsheet assistant capable of performing complex calculations in response to a simple typed request.

This is likely to complicate efforts to use the technology widely, by for example by mixing misleading or biased information into search results.
One reason for tech industry excitement around ChatGPT, fed by its parlor tricks, is the suggestion it might disrupt the long-standing dominance of Google and other tech giants, by allowing small companies to outcompete much larger competitors. One popular theory is that the bot could transform web search.
For Microsoft, investing more in OpenAI could offer a way to ensure that if there is a disruptive AI moment, the company will be not only unscathed but positioned to benefit.
Nathan Benaich , an investor with Air Street Capital who tracks trends in AI, says that while there is plenty of hype around generative AI, there are many ways that Microsoft could use the technology to improve its products.
The company's broad and varied product range, from enterprise and cloud services to consumer devices and software, provide many potential opportunities. Microsoft already uses the technology behind ChatGPT to auto-generate snippets of code in its Visual Studio product, and it is reportedly looking at using ChatGPT to improve the performance of its laggardly search engine, Bing.
‚ÄúThe surface‚Äîthe application space that Microsoft has with all its customers‚Äîis just so vast,‚Äù Benaich says. For Microsoft, a company worth about $1.7 trillion, he says, $10 billion is not a large sum given the potential payoffs. Semafor reported that the investment would give OpenAI a valuation of $29 billion.
David Yoffie , a professor at Harvard Business School who researches the strategies of big tech platforms, says Microsoft may also see OpenAI as a way to play catch-up. The larger company lags Google and others when it comes to cutting-edge AI research, he says. ‚ÄúMore work is needed, which is why the investment is needed,‚Äù Yoffie says. ‚ÄúThe money they're investing could accelerate OpenAI's ability to make it commercializable.‚Äù In 2019, Microsoft invested $1 billion in OpenAI in a deal that tied the AI company to using its cloud computing platform. Building tools like ChatGPT requires vast amounts of computing power as well as training data, and so backing OpenAI could feed into Microsoft‚Äôs ambitions to carve off a greater share of the cloud computing market. OpenAI‚Äôs cutting edge demands could help Microsoft develop more powerful cloud technology that can help it stand out. In 2021, Amazon had 40 percent of the cloud market compared to Microsoft‚Äôs 15 percent , with Google‚Äîwidely seen as the AI leader‚Äîholding just 6 percent.

Microsoft can benefit from this, Yang says. The giant‚Äôs relationship with the startup allows it to tap the fruits of its risk-taking, but at a convenient distance.
The terms of Microsoft‚Äôs potential new investment in OpenAI are unclear but, according to Semafor , could see the larger company receive 75 percent of OpenAI‚Äôs profits until the investment is repaid. It would then retain a 49 percent stake in OpenAI, with other investors owning another 49 percent, and OpenAI‚Äôs parent nonprofit holding 2 percent. An earlier report in the The Wall Street Journal suggests that several investment companies are also eyeing stakes in OpenAI.
It may be no coincidence that OpenAI is raising funds when ChatGPT is at the center of swelling hype around generative AI‚Äîbut before many people have tried to build products with the technology.
‚ÄúOpenAI has done a masterful job of marketing and creating demo-ware,‚Äù says Mike Volpi, a partner at Index Ventures , an investor in startup Cohere.ai , which competes with OpenAI on language models. He is more skeptical about the trend than some other investors and says much is still to be determined about the commercial potential of this technology. One open question is how unique the models made by OpenAI or other companies will be, and another is whether the problem of making models behave consistently can be solved. ‚ÄúYou have to create a careful balance between what it can do today and what people hope they will do,‚Äù Volpi says.
Some seasoned tech entrepreneurs are also cautious. Phil Libin, CEO of note-taking app Evernote from 2007 to 2015, says he is a big fan of AI but is wary of the current fever. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to take a huge amount of work to get these AI models to actually deliver with the promise that people think it‚Äôs going to,‚Äù he says.
Libin also sees tricky technical challenges ahead. One is that ChatGPT and other generative AI models are currently created by scraping content made by humans from the web, but are increasingly contributing to the text and images found online. ‚ÄúAll of these models are about to shit all over their own training data,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre about to be flooded with a tsunami of bullshit.‚Äù You Might Also Like ‚Ä¶ üì® Make the most of chatbots with our AI Unlocked newsletter Taylor Swift, Star Wars, Stranger Things , and Deadpool have one man in common Generative AI is playing a surprising role in Israel-Hamas disinformation The new era of social media looks as bad for privacy as the last one Johnny Cash‚Äôs Taylor Swift cover predicts the boring future of AI music Your internet browser does not belong to you üîå Charge right into summer with the best travel adapters , power banks , and USB hubs Senior Writer X Topics artificial intelligence machine learning Startups Google deep learning Search Silicon Valley Venture Capital neural networks Will Knight Will Knight Will Knight Susan D'Agostino Christopher Beam Steven Levy Niamh Rowe Amanda Hoover Facebook X Pinterest YouTube Instagram Tiktok More From WIRED Subscribe Newsletters Mattresses Reviews FAQ Wired Staff Coupons Black Friday Editorial Standards Archive Contact Advertise Contact Us Customer Care Jobs Press Center RSS Accessibility Help Cond√© Nast Store Do Not Sell My Personal Info ¬© 2023 Cond√© Nast.
