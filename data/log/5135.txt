Ratchet & Clank (PlayStation 4) This is a remake of the original Ratchet & Clank , featuring the familiar 3D platforming and shooting gameplay with updated levels and stunning graphics. This is a great game to play if you want to show off the PlayStation 4’s improved hardware.
Mighty No. 9 (PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3) This is a 2D action-platformer inspired by the classic Mega Man series.
Mighty No. 9 was a disappointment with its ugly graphics and clunky levels, but now curious gamers with PS Plus can check it.
Claire: Extended Cut (PlayStation 4, Vita) Claire is a 2D horror game, which is something of a novelty. It’s an indie title from Hailstorm Games and could be worth checking out if you’re looking for something unique.
Bombing Busters (PlayStation 4, Vita) Bombing Busters is a Bomberman clone. It’s not super-interesting or creative, but if you like Bomberman … well, here it is.
Legend of Kay (PlayStation 3) Legend of Kay is a 3D action-platformer that came out for the PlayStation 2 in 2015. This PlayStation 3 version followed 10 years later in 2015.
