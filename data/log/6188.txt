We hope you’re feeling lucky.
We’re giving away an Xbox One (500GB model with Kinect) and a copy of racing game Forza Horizon 2 , complete with a code for the Duracell Car Pack. We also have four other copies of Forza Horizon 2 and the car pack.
Want a chance to win them? Well, you just need to find the code. We’re going to hide it in a picture just like the one on the right, except the word “test” will instead be the code you need to e-mail to us.
 The picture is hidden in one of our stories covering E3, which you can find here.
