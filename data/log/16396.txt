Fall is upon us, and we are gasping for breath under a deluge of games. That’s one of the reasons this week’s episode of the GamesBeat Decides podcast is extra long. We spend a ton of time talking about games before diving into some news, but the big topic this week is all about big games like Lawbreakers, Agents of Mayhem, and Battleborn crashing and burning immediately after launching.
Lawbreakers has only a couple hundred people playing at any one time, and Agents of Mayhem was the No. 16 best-selling game in the United States during its debut month of August, according to industry-tracking firm The NPD Group.
 Lawbreakers and Agents are the latest releases from Cliff Bleszinski and Saints Row team Volition, respectively. These are important creators who have made hits before, but their latest projects are commercial flops. What makes this even more fascinating is that neither game is critically reviled. Few people hate Agents of Mayhem or Lawbreakers — it’s just that no one is playing them.
You can get that discussion in the second half of our episode. In the first segment, we talk about everything else. Here’s the full list of discussed games: Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite Divinity: Original Sin 2 Talisman: Digital Edition Hearthstone Fortnite: Battlegrounds Observer The Little Ball That Could Metroid: Samus Returns Subscribe on Apple Podcasts , Google Play Music , or Stitcher Listen on Cast GB Decides on Facebook Watch live on Twitch Watch on YouTube Subscribe to the RSS Follow us: GamesBeat on Twitter GamesBeat Decides on Twitter JeffGrubb on Twitter Mike Minotti on Twitter Stephanie Chan on Twitter Jason Wilson on Twitter Anthony Agnello on Twitter GamesBeat's creed when covering the game industry is "where passion meets business."
