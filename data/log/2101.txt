Whatever you call it, it’s actually your brain’s default mode. We spend at least a third of our waking hours thinking about things other than what is happening immediately in front of us. Mind wandering isn’t all bad— it can foster creativity —however, when you need to be present, it takes practice and intention to get there. You can in fact train your brain to focus on the here and now using meditation, but it’s not something you just “get” immediately.
It is admittedly pretty difficult to be present in our lives (so much so that researchers out of University College London admit our smartphones have become a second home, in a sense), but technology isn’t entirely to blame. In the case of learning how to meditate, it can actually help. However, practicing mindfulness requires more than a meditation app and some free time.
You can’t become an experienced meditator without first understanding the goal of meditation. This first step is where a lot of people get hung up. There isn’t a right or wrong way to meditate, as long as you reach the desired outcome: bringing your mind back to the present.
“There is this expectation that you are going to be good and it's going to be easy,” explains Estevan Valdes , a yoga teacher and fitness professional whose offerings include meditation. “And that it is rigid. That you have to be completely still, you have to be completely erect and that is going to create what is seen as ‘success.’” The problem comes when you think you can clear your mind—that’s not the goal. In fact, Valdes admits, there are very fleeting moments of your mind being empty in meditation; they state that being present is meditation.
Deciding what you want to get from meditation determines what type of meditation you should do (which then dictates which app is the best for you). While there are many forms of meditation, research has confirmed that multiple meditative techniques can reduce neural activity in the parts of the brain associated with mind-wandering. It’s true that some types are more rigid than others; perhaps the most common in a scientific setting is Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) , which has been around since the 1970s and involves mindfulness meditation, body scanning, and yoga postures.
One such study that employed MBSR found that taking a meditation course—and therefore, becoming a more experienced meditator—had a marked effect on stress management.
Lead author of that study, Elizabeth A. Hoge, associate professor and director of the Anxiety Disorders Research Program in Georgetown University Medical Center's Department of Psychiatry, noted that MBSR is used in a clinical setting because it helps researchers “adhere to rigorous methodological standardization” thanks to its guide manual for instructors, but adds that there are other types of meditation—such as Metta meditation, based on Buddhist teachings of loving-kindness—that can have similar benefit.

In fact, breathwork with the goal of having a mindful moment is what Zeidan says is the basis of most of the current meditation apps.
Diana Winston , director of mindfulness education at UCLA's Mindful Awareness Research Center (MARC) , notes that there is a lot of research on mindfulness, which is why a lot of the apps are mindfulness-based. This includes Headspace and Calm —which are some of the most well known—and even UCLA Mindful , guided by Winston and the MARC team.
Whether your goal is to reduce anxiety, become more mindful in your daily life, or develop a daily meditation practice, research has found that online meditation can work; you just have to know what you should be working with.
If there is no one meditation technique to rule them all, how do you know which one will work for you? This is where apps can be extremely helpful, as they provide an opportunity to try a lot of different techniques, all in one, easily-accessible place. According to Zeidan, however, you don’t want an app that has you doing too much, too fast. (For example, you shouldn’t be doing three different types of meditation in a 15-minute span.) “One way to judge the efficacy of an app is how many techniques they introduce to you at a given—small amount of—time,” Zeidan says. “You don't want that; you really want to master one thing and then move on. We have a tendency to want to try a lot of things, but I think focusing on breath and the body are really the most critical methods to start with.” Again, mindfulness meditation is growing in popularity and can be achieved through multiple practices—such as breathwork, body scan meditation, walking meditation, and more—but finding which one works best for you may require some trial and error. “Which app you choose depends somewhat on your goals,” adds Winston. “Is it mindfulness you are looking for or some other type of practice? If you want to learn mindfulness, there are many apps out there and it can be overwhelming; what people tend to do is go to the ones that are most well known, like Headspace, which are good apps. The issue is finding something that you resonate with.” If you don’t have a connection to your meditation app, it will be near impossible to have a connection to yourself in the moment. Winston says something as simple as finding the instructor's voice to be annoying is enough of a reason to try a new instructor on the app or, if that isn’t an available option, get a new app altogether.
“Trust your own intuition, listen and really watch the way that you instinctually react to the person [or instructor],” adds Valdes. “If you don't feel connected it might be hard to focus.” Ultimately, they say, if you don’t feel like you fit the atmosphere of a specific app, class, or instructor, don’t hesitate to move on. You’re not stuck with any one app or method. If you don't feel attracted to the vibration that the person or technique is offering you, there is so much stuff out there.” Gear Humanity’s Most Obnoxious Vehicle Gets an Electric (and Nearly Silent) Makeover Boone Ashworth Gear You’ll Be Able Buy Cars on Amazon Next Year Boone Ashworth Gear The Best USB Hubs and Docks for Connecting All Your Gadgets Eric Ravenscraft Gear The Best Black Friday Deals on Electric Bikes and Accessories Adrienne So It is important to keep in mind that certain meditation techniques, such as Vipsanna—a Buddhist practice focusing inward on the self—are rooted in ancient practices, which is a fact that is often lost in the colonization of the wellness space. Because of this, Valdes suggests that people who have an interest in starting a meditation practice seek out instructors that have it as a form of their indigenous or cultural practice. In app form, options include Plum Village , created by the monastic community led by Buddhist visionary Thich Nhat Hanh, and Liberate , a meditation app designed for the Black community, featuring BIPOC instructors.
If you’re looking to become an experienced meditator, then you’ll want to look for an app that has an education component of guided meditations and exercises—for example, popular app Waking Up includes lessons and conversations about meditation theory—until you find what helps you reach the goal of training your mind to be present.
Winston notes that many apps will offer courses in week-long increments, for example, as an introduction to the basics of meditation. Most educators suggest studying meditation in a one-on-one capacity, because many experienced meditators often receive individualized instruction or go so far to attend in-person retreats. Finding an app that comes with access to a professional is a feature to seek out should questions arise during your practice.
Ten Percent Happier is one such app, offering subscribers access to a personal meditation coach. “Some of the things that come up [during meditation] can be personal to that individual and there is awareness of other things that can be awoken, such as trauma, and side effects, such as seeing spots and feeling like you’re floating,” says Zeidan. “Having clarity can help you not let your mind wander on what it is.” In other words? Actually use the app. While there is no magic number experts can provide to tell you how much or how long to meditate, Winston encourages you to do it when you can. Of course a daily practice is preferable, but it’s less about how much time you spend per day and more about overall consistency. In fact, research suggests long-term meditation practices do have measurable impacts on the brain.
“To become an experienced meditator you have to keep practicing,” says Zeidan. “I actually asked the Dalai Lama [when showing] him my research, ‘How much training is needed to really be a good meditator?’ And he said: ‘A lifetime.’” Gear Humanity’s Most Obnoxious Vehicle Gets an Electric (and Nearly Silent) Makeover Boone Ashworth Gear You’ll Be Able Buy Cars on Amazon Next Year Boone Ashworth Gear The Best USB Hubs and Docks for Connecting All Your Gadgets Eric Ravenscraft Gear The Best Black Friday Deals on Electric Bikes and Accessories Adrienne So Practicing doesn’t just involve how many times you open the app or the number of meditation sessions you complete. It’s also going to involve practicing the specific methods introduced. Again, mindfulness isn’t easy; our brains aren’t wired for it. “People should be patient with themselves,” says Hoge. “It does take some time to develop the practice. Also, people shouldn't give up because they ‘can't clear my mind.’ No one can do that for more than a few seconds. It’s more about what you do when you notice you've gotten distracted from your meditation focus.” It’s likely you’ll experience some sort of benefit after just one meditation session.
 But how will you know when the app is really working for you? “One way to judge if it's helping is not asking yourself if you’re able to notice your breathing,” says Winston, “but How is it affecting my life? Am I feeling calmer and more peaceful? Do I notice I am less reactive with my kids or my partner? These are markers that the app is working. Look for changes in life instead of becoming the best meditator.” Zeidan notes studies have found our meditative state can become more trait-like over time. In this case, he likens the brain to a muscle; the way you feel when meditating becomes stronger and almost like a personality trait.
“You can never actually be ‘good’ at mindfulness meditation; that is one thing that is inherently American in the way that we think about this Eastern practice,” says Zeidan. “It is about cultivating awareness of the present moment. You will always find your mind to be distracted, just hopefully you get better at not getting agitated with yourself for being distracted. That is meditation; when you can stop judging yourself and the stuff around you that you are experiencing. That is really the magic of it: Being present without judgement.” 📩 The latest on tech, science, and more: Get our newsletters !
