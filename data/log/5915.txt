The mind-boggling reach of the so-called “PayPal Mafia” is well known in Silicon Valley.
This network of former PayPal employees and executives seems to be at the center of just about everything happening in Silicon Valley over the past decade. LinkedIn. Yelp. Yammer. 500 Startups. YouTube.
This list seems infinite, and the network of connections is byzantine. But the folks at Fleximize , a U.K.-based firm that offers various funding options to companies, decided to try to chart all these pathways in one crazy, interactive graphic.
So, for the startup-obsessed among us, feel free to indulge and nerd-out as you explore and discover the wealth of links this remarkable group has established.
See the full story of the PayPal Mafia.
