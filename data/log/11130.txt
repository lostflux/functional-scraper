Standing in the stately Gaston Hall auditorium at Georgetown University‚Äîwhich has hosted the likes of Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, and Bono‚Äîthe Facebook CEO declared, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here today because I believe we must continue to stand for free expression.‚Äù And a city full of regulation-hungry politicians and foes of Big Tech undoubtedly thought: How‚Äôs that working out? Zuckerberg‚Äôs highly promoted speech introduced no new Facebook features or initiatives, but was a defiant reply to critics of Facebook‚Äôs destructive effects on global society‚Äî manipulating voters , fomenting division, and even aiding genocide.
 He doubled down on Facebook‚Äôs handling of the treacherous business of implementing free expression at an unprecedented global scale. Despite considerable evidence that the approach has often fallen short, Zuckerberg still professes optimism: Giving people a voice and connecting the world, he believes, are transformationally positive actions. Essentially, he‚Äôs saying‚Äîas he always has‚Äîthat Facebook is essentially positive.
What‚Äôs more, he was claiming high ground for Facebook‚Äôs values. If you disagree with him on speech, he implied, you‚Äôre siding with the forces of censorship and elitism. He described a ‚Äúcountertrend ‚Ä¶ to pull back on free expression.‚Äù His foes, he implied, are the same kind of people who wanted Eugene Debs in prison, who wanted Vietnam protesters stopped. But the people whose Facebook presence is more disturbing include the likes of Alex Jones (whom Facebook ultimately banned) or ‚Ä¶ Donald Trump. The speech didn‚Äôt really take on those kinds of choices.
Furthermore, rejecting his point of view will align you with the oppressive overlords of China! He pointedly noted that his dreams of taking Facebook to that country have been stalemated by that country‚Äôs demands on data and censorship. While Facebook‚Äôs encrypted WhatsApp service is a boon to protesters, he says, the Chinese TikTok app censors mentions of protests even for users in the US.
Zuckerberg clearly believed in what he was saying: Though his presentation was sometimes halting (maybe reflecting that he was tinkering with the speech until his deadline), his voice grew stronger when invoking Facebook as an instrument of empowerment. He spoke for almost 40 minutes, which is what happens when senators aren‚Äôt interrupting you.
But while he constantly described Facebook as giving voice to everyday people and underrepresented groups, he gave short shrift to the way that powerful forces are using his platform to manipulate people. In the past two years , Zuckerberg and his leadership team have admitted that they were late to recognize the downside of free expression: political extremism, intentional misinformation, and political ads that baldly lie.
At every turn, the company has avoided becoming an arbiter of what is news and what political utterances are destructive. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs right for a private company to censor politicians or the news in a democracy,‚Äù he said, a sentiment he often expresses. But neither does that mean that a private company has to promote outright lies and divisive content. It would have been interesting if he‚Äôd grappled with that concept more in his Georgetown address.

Zuckerberg‚Äôs foray into the belly of the Beltway to deliver a message of free speech was, in a sense, a daring gambit. It‚Äôs hard to disagree with the First Amendment, and even less attractive to align with censors. But his critics‚Äîand a lot of people who are simply unhappy with Facebook‚Äîare asking for more. Boosting speech at global scale is a tricky and unprecedented practice. Though Zuckerberg constantly cites the army he now employs in matters of security and safety (up to 35,000), it‚Äôs not clear that a ‚Äúcommunity‚Äù of almost 3 billion people can be purged of truly destructive content. Facebook is a huge experiment that constantly tests Zuckerberg‚Äôs deeply felt claim that connecting the world will yield a net positive. The results are far from settled.
After the speech, Zuckerberg took a few questions from Georgetown students in the audience (which were submitted in writing, not offered spontaneously). One questioned whether Facebook was favoring conservatives with its green light to misinformation in political ads. Zuckerberg agreed with Georgetown‚Äôs moderator that liberals are angry, too. ‚ÄúRight now, we‚Äôre doing a very good job of making everyone angry at us,‚Äù he said.
No one seemed to disagree with that.
 And things won‚Äôt change after Zuckerberg‚Äôs Tom Paine moment.
