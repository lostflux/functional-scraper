Game publisher TinyBuild announced that it has invested $3 million into game studio Hologryph , the development team behind the hit multiplayer game Secret Neighbor. The investment grants TinyBuild a majority stake in the studio, and the funds will go toward supporting a soon-to-be-announced new intellectual property for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.
The Seattle-based publisher also announced some fresh figures for the Hello Neighbor franchise : the series has exceeded 60 million downloads across PC, Xbox One, PS4, Google Stadia, Android and iOS, and Nintendo Switch.
TinyBuild CEO Alex Nichiporchik said in an email to GamesBeat that the investment will be used to expand the Hologryph team as it works on a next-generation console game.
