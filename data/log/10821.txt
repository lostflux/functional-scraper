The AI-powered ChatGPT, created by the San Francisco company OpenAI, has caused a sensation for its ability to write essays, poems and programming code on demand within seconds, prompting widespread fears over cheating or of professions becoming obsolete.
Chinese tech companies have joined the global rush to develop rival software, with Alibaba and JD.com announcing similar projects.
Q&A AI explained: what is a large language model (LLM)? Show What LLMs have done for text, “generative adversarial networks” have done for images, films, music and more. Strictly speaking, a GAN is two neural networks: one built to label, categorise and rate, and the other built to create from scratch. By pairing them together, you can create an AI that can generate content on command.
Say you want an AI that can make pictures. First, you do the hard work of creating the labelling AI, one that can see an image and tell you what is in it, by showing it millions of images that have already been labelled, until it learns to recognise and describe “a dog”, “a bird”, or “a photograph of an orange cut in half, showing that its inside is that of an apple”. Then, you take that program and use it to train a second AI to trick it. That second AI “wins” if it can create an image to which the first AI will give the desired label.
Once you’ve trained that second AI, you’ve got what you set out to build: an AI that you can give a label and get a picture that it thinks matches the label.
Or a song.
Or a video.
 Or a 3D model.

The company showed audiences a video of the bot answering questions about the popular Chinese science fiction novel The Three-Body Problem and generating a plot summary. It also displayed Ernie Bot’s algebra skills and generated audio in Sichuanese and Hakka dialects of Chinese.
Baidu’s Hong Kong-listed shares plunged immediately after the software was unveiled, sliding by more than 10% at one point. They recovered slightly afterwards, down about 7% on Thursday afternoon.
The company launched Ernie Bot in a grand media conference in its Beijing headquarters that was livestreamed on YouTube and other platforms on Thursday. Ernie, which stands for “enhanced representation through knowledge integration”, is powered by a deep-learning AI model developed by Baidu that draws on the data from its search engine.
Li said the technology was still flawed but was being released to meet huge customer demand. “Our expectations for Ernie Bot are close to ChatGPT, even GPT-4,” Li said, referring to OpenAI’s latest chatbot technology launched this week.
He said about 650 companies had already signed on to become part of the chatbot’s ecosystem, which would be integrated into Baidu’s other products, as well as bolster other technology including the cloud and driverless cars.
Aimed primarily at the Chinese market, Ernie Bot’s Chinese-language understanding extends to Chinese dialects. Li in the prerecorded videos showed how the chatbot answered questions and solved maths equations. The bot was also seen being asked to write a Chinese poem with a Chinese idiom, generate images and text, as well as suggest business names and slogans.
Baidu is the first Chinese tech company to launch its contender in the blossoming chatbot space. Other Chinese companies, including ByteDance and Tencent, have announced plans to launch their own AI chatbots.

after newsletter promotion The demand generated by ChatGPT’s success prompted a race among the country’s tech companies to develop a Chinese equivalent. But China’s strict censorship and US restrictions on chip sales could limit Baidu and other Chinese contenders’ AI ambitions.
ChatGPT is blocked in China, but the American software is gaining a base of Chinese users who use virtual private networks to get around the ban, deploying it to write essays and cram for exams.
Li warned against seeing the technology through the lens of US-China tensions. “Ernie Bot is not a tool of confrontation between China and the United States,” he said.
The Chinese president, Xi Jinping, called for China to become more self-reliant through its own innovations in science and technology in a speech earlier this week.
