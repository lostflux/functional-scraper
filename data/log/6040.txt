Sony has revealed the games it’ll roll out as part of its Instant Library next month, and it’s especially exciting if you haven’t put your PlayStation 3 away yet.
The PlayStation company posted a blog today that details what games PS4, PS3, and Vita owners can expect to get as part of their premium PlayStation Plus subscriptions. And it will bring some undead, some wizards, and some sci-fi action to all of you rocking Sony’s consoles.
PS Plus is Sony’s membership service. It gets PlayStation 4 gamers access to only multiplayer along with the Instant Library of games. For Sony, this means more revenue and more engagement as it ensures that even busy subscribers will turn their system on to download their “free games.” And now here’s the breakdown by platform for November: Event GamesBeat at the Game Awards We invite you to join us in LA for GamesBeat at the Game Awards event this December 7. Reserve your spot now as space is limited! PS4 The Walking Dead: Season Two Magicka 2 Dragon Fin Soup PS3 Mass Effect 2 Beyond Good and Evil Dragon Fin Soup Vita InviZimals Dragon Fin Soup The headliners here are probably Mass Effect 2 and Beyond Good and Evil. The former is a sci-fi role-playing game from BioWare. The latter is a Zelda-like adventure game that explores fear and politics in a time of war.
Of course, The Walking Dead: Season Two is the followup to developer Telltale’s beloved story about a man and a small girl trying to survive during the zombie apocalypse. Magicka 2 is an action-adventure fantasy game with co-op multiplayer.
Finally, you’ll also get InviZimals and Dragon Fin Soup. InviZimals is an augmented-reality game for the Vita that has you capturing monsters for battle. Dragon Fin Soup, meanwhile, is a new release that features Super Nintendo-style role-playing action.
