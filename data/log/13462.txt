But Where Are They Headed? ILLUSTRATION: JAMES MARSHALL; GETTY IMAGES Save this story Save Save this story Save The short videos give the impression of a flipbook, jumping shakily from one surreal frame to the next. They‚Äôre the result of internet meme-makers playing with the first widely available text-to-video AI generators, and they depict impossible scenarios like Dwayne ‚ÄúThe Rock‚Äù Johnson eating rocks and French president Emmanuel Macron sifting through and chewing on garbage, or warped versions of the mundane, like Paris Hilton taking a selfie.
This new wave of AI-generated videos has definite echoes of Dall-E , which swept the internet last summer when it performed the same trick with still images. Less than a year later, those wonky Dall-E images are almost indistinguishable from reality, raising two questions: Will AI-generated video advance as quickly, and will it have a place in Hollywood? Digital Culture Jason Parham Courtroom Drama Chris Stokel-Walker Game-changing Will Knight ModelScope , a video generator hosted by AI firm Hugging Face, allows people to type a few words and receive a startling, wonky video in return. Runway, the AI company that cocreated the image generator Stable Diffusion, announced a text-to-video generator in late March, but it has not made it widely available to the public. And Google and Meta both announced they were working on text-to-video tech in fall of 2022.
RIght now, it‚Äôs jarring celebrity videos or a teddy bear painting a self-portrait. But in the future, AI‚Äôs role in film could evolve beyond the viral meme, allowing tech to help cast movies, model scenes before they‚Äôre shot, and even swap actors in and out of scenes. The technology is advancing rapidly, and it will likely take years before such generators could, say, produce an entire short film based on prompts, if they‚Äôre ever able to. Still, AI‚Äôs potential in entertainment is massive.
‚ÄúThe way Netflix disrupted how and where we watch content, I think AI is going to have an even bigger disruption on the actual creation of that content itself,‚Äù says Sinead Bovell, a futurist and founder of tech education company WAYE.
But that doesn‚Äôt mean AI will entirely replace writers, directors, and actors anytime soon. And some sizable technical hurdles remain. The videos look jumpy because the AI models can‚Äôt yet maintain full coherence from frame to frame, which is needed to smooth the visuals. Making content that lasts longer than a few fascinating, grotesque seconds and keeps its consistency will require more computer power and data, which means big investments in the tech‚Äôs development. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt easily scale up these image models,‚Äù says Bharath Hariharan, a professor of computer science at Cornell University.

The speed of progress is the result of new developments that bolstered the generators. ModelScope is trained on text and image data, like image generators are, and then also fed videos that show the model how movement should look, says Apolin√°rio Passos, a machine-learning art engineer at Hugging Face. It‚Äôs the tactic also being used by Meta.
 It removes the burden of annotating videos, or labeling them with text descriptors, which simplifies the process and has ushered in rapid development of the tech.
But this generative video tech is unlikely to cut humans out of the film process. Wonder Dynamics, a company that allows filmmakers to drag and drop computer-generated characters into videos, uses AI to provide a cheaper way for visual effects to make their way into movies. The goal is to add more imaginative characters like aliens and robots to supplement the process and make VFX more accessible, rather than just adding generated humans instead of real people. If movies lose their human touch, the ‚Äúmovie magic‚Äù could vanish, says Nikola Todorovic, Wonder Dynamics‚Äô cofounder. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the point of movies if no human is involved in making them?‚Äù The success of AI in film will depend on whether it can recreate that magic. Attempts so far have been intriguing but ultimately disappointing, or harmful‚Äîa reminder that just because AI can engineer content doesn‚Äôt mean it should.
 ‚Äú Nothing, Forever ,‚Äù a never-ending, streaming AI parody take on Seinfeld , got temporarily banned from Twitch in February after its main character, ‚ÄúLarry Feinberg,‚Äù told transphobic jokes. After a clip of Will Smith shoveling spaghetti into his mouth, likely made using ModelScope, went viral last week, it was almost immediately deemed ‚Äú demonic ‚Äù and ‚Äú horrific.
‚Äù As Jason Parham wrote for WIRED earlier this week, the AI had turned ‚Äúfantasy into gross minstrelsy.‚Äù Such AI creations can be demeaning, stripping subjects of control of their own image. ‚ÄúThey are visceral in their presentation, their distortion a dagger,‚Äù Parham writes.

She thinks that may happen over the next decade. But even if it‚Äôs possible, questions remain about whether or not that is what audiences want. ‚ÄúSociety may decide that something about that doesn‚Äôt feel right,‚Äù she says.
The videos raise other ethical concerns too. Right now, text-to-video clips are largely unbelievable. But as the tech progresses, it could make it easier for anyone to make compelling deepfakes with just a few lines of text. And, like image generators, they could be subject to copyright lawsuits for their use of unowned imagery.
Creating a full movie or show from one generator and a few lines of text is a big lift, but combining different AI tools could make it possible, says Passos. ChatGPT could write a script, a voice generator could read it, video generators could create the visuals, and then all of the pieces could be edited together. ‚ÄúYou have these building blocks already,‚Äù Passos says. ‚ÄúOne model that does it all may be leaps away. But these leaps can come in weeks.‚Äù You Might Also Like ‚Ä¶ üì® Make the most of chatbots with our AI Unlocked newsletter Taylor Swift, Star Wars, Stranger Things , and Deadpool have one man in common Generative AI is playing a surprising role in Israel-Hamas disinformation The new era of social media looks as bad for privacy as the last one Johnny Cash‚Äôs Taylor Swift cover predicts the boring future of AI music Your internet browser does not belong to you üîå Charge right into summer with the best travel adapters , power banks , and USB hubs Staff Writer X Topics artificial intelligence machine learning Movies Angela Watercutter Alex Winter Angela Watercutter Angela Watercutter Angela Watercutter Amanda Hoover Kate Knibbs Angela Watercutter Facebook X Pinterest YouTube Instagram Tiktok More From WIRED Subscribe Newsletters Mattresses Reviews FAQ Wired Staff Coupons Black Friday Editorial Standards Archive Contact Advertise Contact Us Customer Care Jobs Press Center RSS Accessibility Help Cond√© Nast Store Do Not Sell My Personal Info ¬© 2023 Cond√© Nast.
