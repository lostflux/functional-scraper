At Apple’s Gather Round event in Cupertino today, the company announced its iPhone XR , iPhone XS, and iPhone XS Max , successors to the iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus , and the iPhone X.
 Apple’s 12th-generation phones are now official.
Preorders for the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max begin September 21, and the devices will begin shipping September 28. Like with the iPhone X, you’ll have to wait longer for the iPhone XR: until October 19 to preorder and until October 26 for it to ship.
Before you get your credit card ready, and assuming you’re not enthused about Android 9.0 Pie (that’s really your only option, as Windows 10 Mobile and BlackBerry are dead), you might want to see exactly what you’re getting. The tables below show you what Apple has changed — we’ve decided to compare the iPhone 8 and iPhone XR, iPhone X and iPhone XS, as well as the iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone XS Max, at the time of each of their respective launches.

You’re getting a slightly more powerful phone, with one-hour worse battery life — thankfully you don’t have to pay more for it. No wonder Apple killed off the iPhone X — it really has no place in the lineup.

And if you want the best iPhone, as always, it will cost you.
One last thing: Touch ID is not available in any of these new phones. Keep that in mind if you’re not a fan of Face ID.
