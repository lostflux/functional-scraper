Originally inspired by IDEO, Google Ventures design partner Jake Knapp began conducting these design sprints years ago with portfolio companies. At one point, I even sat in on one.
Google Ventures has long preached the concept and has publicly detailed its various stages, from idea development and prototyping to user testing. With today’s release, however, the design sprint guide gets a lot more formal, and sets the stage for Google Ventures’ plan to publish its techniques in book form (something the company also announced today ).
