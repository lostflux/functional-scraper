Well, Fornite is gone. So there‚Äôs that. Also, Joker is still making a lot of money and Martin Scorsese still doesn‚Äôt like Marvel movies. Let‚Äôs get going.
A strange thing happened yesterday as the massively popular videogame Fortnite wrapped up its 10th season: It disappeared. The game went offline , and hasn‚Äôt been playable since. Following the season finale‚Äîappropriately titled ‚ÄúThe End‚Äù‚Äî Fortnite got sucked into a black hole. Now the game‚Äôs YouTube channel and Instagram and Twitter accounts all just show that void. Eagle-eyed gamers have spotted a series of numbers in the black hole and are fervently trying to decode them, Lost -style. Season 11 still seems likely to happen, but not until players have fully lost their minds.
Director Todd Phillips‚Äô Joker origin story continues to dominate the box office. The flick made another $55 million domestically in its second weekend, giving it a total of $192.7 million in the US and $543.9 million around the world. Meanwhile, Gemini Man brought in $31.1 million domestically and $59.5 million worldwide.
Director Martin Scorsese is still convinced that Marvel movies are nothing but ‚Äútheme parks.‚Äù After causing a stir a few weeks ago for telling Empire that the MCU films aren‚Äôt ‚Äúthe cinema of human beings trying to convey emotional, psychological experiences to another human being,‚Äù the director continued to disparage the movies over the weekend at the London Film Festival, where his new Netflix film, The Irishman , screened. "It's not cinema, it‚Äôs something else," he said.
 "We shouldn‚Äôt be invaded by it. We need cinemas to step up and show films that are narrative films."
