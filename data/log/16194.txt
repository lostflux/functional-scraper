Career website Glassdoor today released its 2019 report on the “Highest Paying Jobs in America.” Out of the top 25 U.S. jobs listed, 14 were in tech — one more than last year , and as always, more than in any other industry (health care was next in line, with six jobs).
Glassdoor’s list is ordered by average base salary. For a job title to be considered, it had to have received at least 100 salary reports shared by U.S.-based employees over the past year (similar job titles were grouped together; C-suite level jobs were excluded). Glassdoor also says it applies “a proprietary statistical algorithm to estimate annual median base pay, which controls for factors such as location and seniority.” Without further ado, here are the 14 tech jobs that made the cut: Enterprise Architect Software Engineering Manager Software Development Manager Applications Development Manager Solutions Architect Data Architect IT Program Manager Systems Architect UX Manager Site Reliability Engineer Cloud Engineer Data Scientist Information Security Engineer Analytics Manager The first three tech jobs placed in the top 10 of the full list. Enterprise Architect was fifth overall, Software Engineering Manager grabbed seventh, and Software Development Manager snuck in at tenth. Last year, four tech positions made it into the top 10.
