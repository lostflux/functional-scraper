In recent months, it has become clear that the same would happen for large language models and generative AI.
 Today, researchers from the security firm Sophos are warning that the latest incarnation of this is showing up in Google Play and Apple‚Äôs App Store, where scammy apps are pretending to offer access to OpenAI ‚Äôs chatbot service ChatGPT through free trials that eventually start charging subscription fees.
There are paid versions of OpenAI‚Äôs GPT and ChatGPT for regular users and developers, but anyone can try the AI chatbot for free on the company‚Äôs website. The scam apps take advantage of people who have heard about this new technology‚Äîand perhaps the frenzy of people clamoring to use it‚Äîbut don‚Äôt have much additional context for how to try it themselves. The researchers first learned about the scam apps after seeing ads for them in news apps and on social networks, but users may also encounter them by searching in Google Play and the App Store.
‚ÄúI saw multiple ads for these types of apps on social media platforms where it‚Äôs cheap to advertise, and sometimes they use tactics like typos in the name‚Äîcalling the app ‚ÄòChat GBT‚Äô or others‚Äîto screen out people who might be a bit more savvy,‚Äù says Sean Gallagher, a senior threat researcher at Sophos. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre trying to screen out people who would do the free trial and then cancel it because it‚Äôs crap. They want the people who are not focused enough to know how to unsubscribe.‚Äù Such scams are known as fleeceware.
And these apps, which hook victims into paying a regular weekly or monthly fee, are difficult to stamp out, because they typically don't exhibit the technically invasive and malicious behavior that would get more explicit malware booted. When scammers submit their apps to Apple and Google for review, the researchers note, they may not include all of the details on the subscription pricing and when users will have to pay to continue receiving functionality. Later, they can revise their demands without changing anything about how the app is engineered.
Google and Apple provide mechanisms for developers to offer in-app purchases, both one-time fees and recurring charges. And these companies get a cut every time apps in their app stores collect payments from users.
In the case of the Android app Open Chat GBT, users could download the app for free but were quickly confronted with huge quantities of ads and could try the chatbot only three times before losing access to its functionality and receiving a prompt to subscribe. By default, users could sign up for a three-day free trial to continue using the app, which would then become a monthly $10 subscription. Open Chat GBT also offered a $30 annual subscription. The researchers found a very similar app with a different name by the same developer for iOS in the App Store.

There were others, though, that remained available after the researchers flagged them to Google and Apple. Both companies acknowledged receipt of the submissions, and Google took down one more app. Google and Apple did not immediately respond to requests for comment about the findings.
The researchers say they suspect that some of the apps use OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT 3 application programming interface to generate content for users while others use lower-quality chatbot functionalities. And instead of limiting the user to a small number of queries, some of the apps would truncate responses and give users only a snippet until they started a subscription.
Gallagher says that one of the biggest problems with fleeceware is that users don't always know how to manage their subscriptions and don't realize that even when they delete an app, their recurring payments will continue to be active with the service.
‚ÄúWe define fleeceware as something that charges an extraordinary amount of money for a feature that is available freely or at very low cost elsewhere,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúAnd it‚Äôs effective, because even I sometimes wonder, why am I getting charged this much by Apple every month? And it's like, OK, there‚Äôs the shared family storage, there's AppleCare for my phone, there‚Äôs Duolingo. You have to be very careful‚Äîyou have to actively manage subscriptions to apps.‚Äù You Might Also Like ‚Ä¶ üì© Get the long view on tech with Steven Levy's Plaintext newsletter Watch this guy work, and you‚Äôll finally understand the TikTok era How Telegram became a terrifying weapon in the Israel-Hamas War Inside Elon Musk‚Äôs first election crisis ‚Äîa day after he ‚Äúfreed‚Äù the bird The ultra-efficient farm of the future is in the sky The best pickleball paddles for beginners and pros üå≤ Our Gear team has branched out with a new guide to the best sleeping pads and fresh picks for the best coolers and binoculars Senior Writer X Topics ChatGPT malware apple Google Matt Burgess Reece Rogers Andrew Couts K.G.
