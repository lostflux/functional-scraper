Photograph: Dado Ruvić/Reuters ChatGPT ChatGPT update will give it a voice and allow users to interact using images The move will bring the artificial intelligence chatbot closer to popular voice assistants such as Apple’s Siri and Amazon’s Alexa Reuters Mon 25 Sep 2023 16.51 EDT OpenAI’s ChatGPT is getting a major update that will enable the viral chatbot to have voice conversations with users and interact using images, moving it closer to popular artificial intelligence (AI) assistants like Apple’s Siri.
The voice feature “opens doors to many creative and accessibility-focused applications”, OpenAI said in a blog post on Monday.
Similar AI services like Siri, Google voice assistant and Amazon’s Alexa are integrated with the devices they run on and are often used to set alarms and reminders, and deliver information off the internet.
Since its debut last year, ChatGPT has been adopted by companies for a wide range of tasks from summarizing documents to writing computer code, setting off a race among big tech companies to launch their own offerings based on generative AI. Google has imminent plans to launch its answer to ChatGPT, called Gemini, which is reportedly already being tested by a small group of companies. Amazon, for its part, announced on Monday it would be investing up to $4bn in the AI startup Anthropic to provide support and boost the e-commerce company’s generative AI efforts.
ChatGPT’s new voice feature can also narrate bedtime stories, settle debates at the dinner table and speak out loud text input from users.
The technology behind it is being used by Spotify for the platform’s podcasters to translate their content into different languages, OpenAI said.
With image support, users can take pictures of things around them and ask the chatbot to “troubleshoot why your grill won’t start, explore the contents of your fridge to plan a meal, or analyze a complex graph for work-related data”.
Alphabet’s Google Lens is currently the popular choice to gain information about images.
