Or you might have found Microsoft‚Äôs Bing app with the company‚Äôs own chatbot inside, powered by OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-4 text generator.
 But ChatGPT itself hasn‚Äôt had an official iPhone app released by its own developer‚Äîuntil now.
Courtesy of OpenAI; Apple OpenAI‚Äôs free ChatGPT app for iOS just hit Apple‚Äôs App Store in the US. As with the original web model of the chatbot, the free-to-use version is built on GPT-3.5, and its most capable persona built on GPT-4 is accessible only if you‚Äôre paying $20 a month for ChatGPT Plus.
OpenAI says the mobile app syncs your history of chats with its bot across devices and will be expanding to other countries ‚Äúin the coming weeks.‚Äù An Android app is coming ‚Äúsoon.‚Äù The biggest change that comes with ChatGPT‚Äôs new mobile incarnation is that you can now talk to the chatbot instead of just typing. OpenAI has added its speech recognition system, Whisper, which the company claims reaches ‚Äúhuman-level robustness and accuracy‚Äù for English. That could give interacting with ChatGPT a different feel and perhaps encourage people to turn to it for ( glitchy ) AI wisdom more often. ChatGPT on iOS will also be limited to phones that can run the iOS 16.1 operating system, which means iPhone 8 or newer hardware models.
But it‚Äôs unclear whether ChatGPT will have the same freewheeling personality in the new iOS app as the original form of ChatGPT on OpenAI‚Äôs own website, given Apple‚Äôs strict content moderation policies in its App Store.
The iPhone maker tells developers that apps should not include ‚Äúdefamatory, discriminatory, or mean-spirited content,‚Äù or content that is ‚Äúoffensive, insensitive, upsetting, intended to disgust, or in exceptionally poor taste.‚Äù It also prohibits overtly sexual or pornographic material, inflammatory religious content, and ‚Äúfalse information and features.‚Äù ChatGPT has some limitations built in, but they can be sidestepped, and the chatbot, like other generative AI tools, is widely documented to sometimes present falsehoods and fabrications as fact, a phenomenon known as hallucination.
In March, The Wall Street Journal reported that Apple had rejected an email app‚Äôs generative-AI-infused update until the developer gave the app a 17+ restriction, expressing concerns that AI tools could generate inappropriate content for children. In the App Store, OpenAI's ChatGPT app is rated for ‚Äú12+ years old." OpenAI did not respond to questions about any additional parameters it may have included in its iOS model, though presumably the mobile app met Apple‚Äôs requirements in order to be permitted in the App Store. Currently, on the web, ChatGPT declines to generate some problematic content when prompted; it will not, for example, write pornographic short stories or make religious jokes, based on WIRED‚Äôs tests, though it will write satire about religious wars. Satire is also a category that‚Äôs allowed in Apple‚Äôs App Store.

OpenAI has made clear that its strategy for making AI smarter also involves training algorithms using feedback gained from logs of people using ChatGPT. The bot‚Äôs iOS manifestation could provide a valuable new stream of queries, and one with a more conversational tone if the speech recognition function proves popular.
A mobile app could also provide OpenAI with totally new signals, like location data. However, Apple has also limited data collection for third-party apps in recent years, starting with the rollout of iOS 14 and iPadOS 14.5 in 2021. App makers, for example, are now required to ask your permission when they want to track you across apps and services owned by other companies, and iPhone users can choose to limit location-tracking within apps.
Apple‚Äôs new controls also mostly block access to a phone‚Äôs ad-tracking identifier, throttling some ad-based business models, including Meta‚Äôs.
 OpenAI doesn‚Äôt run ads against ChatGPT (at least, not yet); it‚Äôs either free, premium, or pay-as-you-go, in the case of its image generator DALL-E.
Apple did not respond to an inquiry from WIRED about any content moderation or data-tracking restrictions that might apply specifically to this new category of AI tools, like the ChatGPT iOS app.
ChatGPT‚Äôs App Store debut may not be welcomed by the entrepreneurs who cannily launched their own chatbot apps over recent months. The app‚Äôs arrival on mobile devices might also help thwart scammers. Earlier this week, security firm Sophos warned that ChatGPT scams are showing up in the Google Play and Apple App Stores.
 Unknowing consumers are lured into downloading ‚Äúfree‚Äù apps pretending to offer access to OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT, only to later get hit with subscription fees for bogus apps. Now, with OpenAI‚Äôs app in the mix, it might be easier to avoid low-quality chatbots with names like ‚ÄúChat GBT.‚Äù You Might Also Like ‚Ä¶ üì© Get the long view on tech with Steven Levy's Plaintext newsletter Watch this guy work, and you‚Äôll finally understand the TikTok era How Telegram became a terrifying weapon in the Israel-Hamas War Inside Elon Musk‚Äôs first election crisis ‚Äîa day after he ‚Äúfreed‚Äù the bird The ultra-efficient farm of the future is in the sky The best pickleball paddles for beginners and pros üå≤ Our Gear team has branched out with a new guide to the best sleeping pads and fresh picks for the best coolers and binoculars Senior Writer X Topics ChatGPT OpenAI Bing chatbots Will Knight Khari Johnson Will Bedingfield Niamh Rowe Khari Johnson Reece Rogers Vittoria Elliott Reece Rogers Facebook X Pinterest YouTube Instagram Tiktok More From WIRED Subscribe Newsletters Mattresses Reviews FAQ Wired Staff Coupons Black Friday Editorial Standards Archive Contact Advertise Contact Us Customer Care Jobs Press Center RSS Accessibility Help Cond√© Nast Store Do Not Sell My Personal Info ¬© 2023 Cond√© Nast.
