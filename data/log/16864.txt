WhatsApp said today that it has launched its web client, but not for iOS users.
In a blog post , WhatsApp wrote that “Today, for the first time, millions of you will have the ability to use WhatsApp on your web browser. Our web client is simply an extension of your phone: The web browser mirrors conversations and messages from your mobile device — this means all of your messages still live on your phone.” Rumors of a WhatsApp web client began circulating last month.
WhatsApp wrote that connecting a web browser to users’ WhatsApp client is easy, starting with going to this site.
 By scanning the QR code that appears, users will automatically have paired their mobile WhatsApp with the WhatsApp web client.
The popular messaging service also said that users’ phones need to stay connected to the Internet in order for the web client to work, and they must install the latest version of WhatsApp on their phone.
Because of “Apple platform limitations,” the web client is not currently available to iOS users, WhatsApp said. It did not address when or if that would change.
Last February, Facebook bought WhatsApp , one of the world’s most popular messaging services, for $19 billion. The service currently claims 700 million users.
