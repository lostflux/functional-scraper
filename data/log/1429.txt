Oresanya Adeyinka Oresanya is a researcher and data scientist at Katalista Ventures, Lithuania, where she develops analytical tools for sustainability approaches. What fascinates her is knowing that behind a big mess of numbers, texts and rough ideas is a story waiting to be told that will drive impact for businesses. She volunteers as an instructor and mentor at AI Plus Club, Ibadan. Outside data science, she writes and holds conversations about experiences of the millennial African career woman.
Oluwatoyin Sanni Oluwatoyin Sanni is currently a researcher at the University of Lincoln where she’s working on research solutions that combine medical robotics, robot learning and computer vision. She holds a BSc in computer science and a MSc in AI and Robotics. Prior to her masters studies, she worked as a software engineer/technical team lead at Andela. In this Workshop, there’ll be a dive in for a hands-on session on “Hyperparameter optimization in Deep learning using Keras Tuner and Optuna.” Pre-Requisites: Prior Knowledge of Deep Learning; Python Knowledge; Familiar with using Notebooks.
Professor Johanna Devaney Assistant Professor of Music at Brooklyn College and the Graduate Center, CUNY. Previously, she was an Assistant Professor of Music Theory and Cognition at The Ohio State Universi and a postdoctoral scholar at the Center for New Music and Audio Technologies (CNMAT) at the University of California at Berkeley. Johanna's research seeks to understand the ways in which humans engage with music, particularly through performance, and how computers can be used to model and augment our understanding of this engagement. Her work draws on the disciplines of music, psychology, and computer science. Johanna's research has been funded by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSRHC), the Fonds de recherche sur la société et la culture (FRQSC), the Google Faculty Research program, and, most recently, the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) Digital Humanities program.
