Photograph: Rex Dream jobs Career choices From Asimov to Ex Machina: sci-fi films inspired my career in robotics Murray Shanahan is professor of cognitive robotics at Imperial College, London. He was an official advisor for science fiction film Ex Machina, a psychological thriller about a revolutionary new form of artificial intelligence (AI).
The science fiction stories of Isaac Asimov inspired me to become a roboticist.
I did my A-levels in the late 70s, and that was the time when home computers were just starting. I began programming and knew immediately that was what I was interested in pursuing as a career. I went to Imperial College to do my computer science degree and in the mid-80s I did a PhD in using logic and symbolic logic for the basis of AI at Cambridge University. I then returned to Imperial, did a long post-doctorate, studied electrical engineering and eventually got my first faculty position there.
I want to understand how human brain function can be used in the field of AI.
We are not really anywhere near the vision of Asimov's robots which inspired me as a kid, so I decided we needed to understand the brain better and started working more and more on neural networks. At the same time, I became very much interested in the possibility of AI having consciousness. The latter is now a respectable and well established area of scientific study.
Creating a conscious AI with human level intelligence is still a distant dream.
In Ex Machina, we are clearly supposed to believe that the AI character Ava has consciousness. I am not saying that AI wouldn't have consciousness if it had human intelligence, but I am not saying it would either. It could go either way and you have to separate those two concepts. But how far are we from any of these ideas becoming reality? It is definitely not around the corner.
We have a moral duty to protect an AI that is capable of suffering.
In the film, our sympathies are with Ava. She is conscious, suffering, and should be allowed freedom. So, I think it is entirely appropriate to have that concern towards her. However, there are huge caveats to that â€“ firstly, we are nowhere near achieving this aim. It is currently a hypothetical issue that is decades or even centuries away. Secondly, it is also possible that we might be able to build human level AI which is not conscious and doesn't experience suffering. In which case we wouldn't have an ethical duty towards it.
AI technology is already here and shaping our modern lives.
We see the use of artificial intelligence in the latest self-driving cars or virtual personal assistants such as Apple's Siri. There are other types of AI that have been around for quite a long time, such as computer vision. The number plate recognition technology that is used for the London congestion charge is one example of this. Then there are the systems that make decisions about mortgages. These types of technology will become increasingly important in the next five to 10 years. But none of that is comparable to human level intelligence. We really don't know how many potential breakthroughs we might have to make to get there. It is all unknown unknowns.
If you want a job in robotics and AI, a degree in a scientific discipline is essential.
You should study computer science, maths, physics or even neuroscience. Everybody should also learn programming. If you are graduating soon, it is a really good time to be entering this industry. AI is a hot field at the moment in terms of career prospects. There is a lot of industrial interest, particularly in machine learning and computer vision. Those are two areas of AI which have really taken off. There are also lots of AI startups, filling a gap in the market by selling expertise in the field to large corporations.
Ex Machina is in cinemas 21 January 2015.
