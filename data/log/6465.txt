PlayStation 4 owners who were looking forward to the Evolve alpha demo this weekend are going to have to wait due to a Sony goof.
Publisher 2K Games and developer Turtle Rock Studios revealed that it is postponing the Evolve test for PS4. Turtle Rock said that it has discovered issues with the demo on PS4 since Sony introduced the 2.0 update for that console’s firmware. This problem is only on PlayStation 4, so that means if you got an invite for Xbox One or PC, you can go ahead and play right now.
“Following the recent PS4 2.00 firmware update, we are experiencing difficulties with the Evolve Big Alpha on PlayStation 4,” reads a 2K statement. “As a result, the test on PlayStation 4 is postponed. PlayStation and 2K are working together on a resolution. Evolve’s closed alpha test is still playable on Xbox One and PC.” The much heralded 2.0 has brought a number of issues to PS4 , such as connectivity problems and occasional freezing (among others).
