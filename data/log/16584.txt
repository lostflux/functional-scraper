These improved styles fix color contrast on form fields and buttons and consistency between editor and admin interfaces. They also add new snackbar notices, standardize to the default WordPress color scheme, and introduce Motion for interacting with your blocks. If you use a keyboard to navigate the dashboard, you’ll be happy to learn the block editor now has a Navigation mode that lets you jump directly from block to block.
