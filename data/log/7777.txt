He claimed it was powerful enough to allow Teslas to pilot themselves without supervision by the end of this year.
 ‚ÄúAll Tesla cars being produced right now have everything necessary for full self-driving,‚Äù Musk said. ‚ÄúAll you need to do is improve the software.‚Äù That‚Äôs a big claim, given that no one has yet demonstrated a self-driving vehicle that‚Äôs ready for market. Because chip design is a complex business, Tesla began designing the chip three years ago when self-driving technology was less advanced. So how did the company decide how much computing power would be sufficient? ‚ÄúA thumb in the wind,‚Äù said Pete Bannon, the veteran chip architect leading Tesla‚Äôs project.
On Monday, Musk said his estimate proved to be spot-on. He predicted that a year from now, more than 1 million Tesla vehicles will be capable of driving themselves while a person sleeps in the driver's seat, and that the company will help customers make money when they are not using their cars by renting them out as ‚Äúrobotaxis‚Äù But Bannon‚Äôs comment is a reminder that many aspects of producing self-driving vehicles are "thumb in the wind" exercises. Tesla is trying to get the technology working without the use of 3D sensors called lidars, which most of its competitors assert are essential. Chip and robotics experts say it‚Äôs unclear what amount of computing power is sufficient for self-driving. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think anyone knows what hardware is needed,‚Äù said Filip Piekniewski, a robot perception specialist at startup Accel Robotics.

At one point, the car didn‚Äôt recognize a turn arrow on a traffic light, and it was notably hesitant at a four-way stop, he adds, although most of the time the driving was impressive.
That experience sounds on par for the herky-jerky world of self-driving car prototypes. Some front-runners in the field are downplaying earlier suggestions that a robot car revolution is near.
Alphabet division Waymo is widely seen as the technological leader, but its launch of a driverless taxi service in Phoenix last year was muted. The vehicles have safety drivers sitting at the wheel, and are not available to the general public. Ford‚Äôs CEO said this month that the industry had ‚Äú overestimated the arrival of autonomous vehicles.‚Äù Even Musk‚Äôs bold claims Monday were a retrenchment. He first announced that Tesla vehicles had the hardware needed for full autonomy in October 2016 , after the company added new cameras and a more powerful computer with chips from Nvidia. The company declined to make anyone available to comment Tuesday.
On Monday, Tesla made that computer, which shipped in hundreds of thousands of Tesla vehicles, into a punching bag. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs night and day,‚Äù Musk said, after Bannon shared stats showing his new hardware outperformed Nvidia‚Äôs. Customers will be able to pay Tesla to pull out the Nvidia-based computers from older cars, and retrofit new computers with the carmaker‚Äôs own chip, according to Musk.
Tesla‚Äôs claims were quickly contested by Nvidia, which called them inaccurate.
One of Bannon‚Äôs slides said Tesla‚Äôs computer, which contains two new chips and is installed behind the glove box, can handle data at almost seven times the rate of Nvidia‚Äôs technology‚Äî144 trillion operations per second, compared with 21 trillion for Nvidia.
Danny Shapiro, Nvidia‚Äôs senior director for automotive, said that was misleading. Tesla compared its two-chip computer with an Nvidia chip, called Xavier, that was released several years before, and is not marketed as a way to power full self-driving. Shapiro said a fairer comparison is Nvidia‚Äôs Drive AGX Pegasus computer, used by companies including Daimler, which he said can deliver more than twice as many operations per second as Tesla‚Äôs new computer.

Bannon also said Tesla‚Äôs design uses power very efficiently, allowing it to be retrofitted into existing models, and reducing the drain on the vehicles‚Äô battery and hence driving range.
Tesla‚Äôs foray into chip design follows a strategy used by Apple and Google. The iPhone maker has long designed its own processors for mobile devices to maximize battery life and performance, while Google makes server chips customized for its AI software.
 Tesla revealed its own chip project at the end of 2017 , although the executive leading it stepped down months later, leaving Bannon to take charge.
All those projects are motivated by gaining efficiency from specially designed chips, compared with off-the-shelf models. General purpose chips pay a penalty for offering a range of features designed for multiple customers, said Kevin Krewell, a semiconductor analyst at Tirias Research. Tesla said Monday that it had crafted its chip to support the artificial neural networks it uses to process data from the eight cameras on each of its vehicles.
Designing your own silicon comes at a steep price, however. Krewell estimated that Tesla‚Äôs three-year project cost at least $60 million. ‚ÄúI'm not sure Tesla makes enough cars to have made the custom chip design economically worthwhile,‚Äù he said. Tesla ships cars in the hundreds of thousands per year , compared with the millions of units that phone or chipmakers produce annually, helping to spread out the costs.
Chowdhry at Global Equities Research said that‚Äôs not a problem for Tesla because it sells its products at higher prices, and is making a longer-term bet on autonomous driving. ‚ÄúWhen you think about Tesla, you can‚Äôt think in terms of quarter to quarter,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúThe technology is a driver for demand for years into the future.‚Äù Combatting drug deaths with opioid vending machines What to expect from Sony's next-gen PlayStation The stunning loneliness of megacities at night Helvetica, the world's most popular font, gets a face-lift A new strategy for treating cancer , thanks to Darwin ‚ú®Optimize your home life with our Gear team's best picks, from robot vacuums to affordable mattresses to smart speakers.
