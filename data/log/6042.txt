Snake’s last mission is a hit.
Konami revealed today that Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain has shipped 5 million copies, including downloads, in its first month. The stealth-based game came out on September 1 for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360. Konami revealed the data in a financial report for the company’s second quarter of financial year 2016, which ended on September 30. This shows that even with all of the drama surrounding its release, fans were happy to purchase Snake’s newest adventure.
Of course, shipped doesn’t mean sold to gamers. This means the overall number Konami has sent to retailers.
That drama centered around the falling out between series director Hideo Kojima and Konami , which is significantly slowing down triple-A production as it focuses on mobile and other divisions.
Our review called Metal Gear Solid V stealth-based perfection that suffered in the story department.

We’re now at the end of October, so Metal Gear Solid V’s number of shipped units is likely much higher. Still, one has to wonder if any amount of success will make Konami reconsider its stance on triple-A game development.
