Amazon today introduced AWS SageMaker Ground Truth to provide data labeling for training AI models through humans or through a custom AI model.
Also announced today: Inferentia, a new AWS chip for the deployment of AI; Elastic Inference to provide more efficient model inference; SageMaker RL for reinforcement learning; and the opening of a common marketplace for developers to sell their AI models.
SageMaker is Amazon’s service to build, train, and deploy machine learning models.
SageMaker was first introduced at re:Invent one year ago and competes with services to build AI like Microsoft’s Azure Machine Learning and Google’s AutoML.
VB Event The AI Impact Tour Connect with the enterprise AI community at VentureBeat’s AI Impact Tour coming to a city near you! This follows the addition of a GitHub integration and built-in algorithms for SageMaker introduced last week. The ability to train models locally on your own machine was introduced earlier this year.
Several AI-related news announcements have been made this week at re:Invent, an annual AWS conference being held in Las Vegas.
On Monday, AWS introduced RoboMaker , a service to help developers test and deploy robotic hardware, and the Gunrock team was named winner of the Alexa Prize , a university student team challenge to make conversational AI capable of maintaining conversation with humans for 20 minutes.
On Tuesday, Amazon opened a marketplace for Docker containers, which includes six Nvidia AI solutions. Amazon also announced the launch of AWS Ground Station , a service for businesses and governments to transmit data from satellites in orbit around the Earth back to antennas at datacenters around the world.
