It‚Äôs part of a growing trend of increased surveillance and security in schools, and a WIRED story this week examined the delicate ethics of this technology. On the one hand, proponents say that facial recognition tech could help school staffers open gates for parents or staff, watch for persons of interest, ensure a child is leaving school with a guardian instead of a stranger, and even deter school shootings. Parents protesting it, though, say they see it as a sign of creeping authoritarianism.
On this week‚Äôs podcast, WIRED Editor in Chief Nick Thompson joins the show from New York to discuss facial recognition tech with Gadget Lab co-host Lauren Goode. They also chat about Google‚Äôs new Pixel 4 smartphone (why is Google making its own smartphone, anyway?) and the surprising speech about freedom of speech that Mark Zuckerberg made on Thursday.
You can read about Zuckerberg‚Äôs freedom-of-speech speech here.
