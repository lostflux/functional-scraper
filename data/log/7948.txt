 While President Barack Obama was up late sending emails and writing letters into the wee hours, and all my friends were telling me they could ‚Äúsleep when they‚Äôre dead,‚Äù I was snoozing away critical hours.
Compared with giraffes, which zonk out for just 30 minutes a day, or dolphins, which rest only one-half of their brains at a time, I‚Äîwho will gleefully luxuriate in nine hours of shut-eye now and then‚Äîam basically a lump who occasionally has wakeful moments.
Turns out I still might have a chance. ‚ÄúSleep is so critical for so many parts of our body and our mind,‚Äù says Aric Prather, a sleep scientist at UCSF. It strengthens the immune system and helps regulate metabolism. It can clear out toxins that build up in the brain and prevent neurodegenerative diseases. ‚ÄúSleep is like the dishwasher of the brain,‚Äù Prather explains in WIRED‚Äôs latest ‚Äú Five Levels ‚Äù video.
Rapid eye movement, or REM, sleep‚Äîthe phase during which we dream‚Äîusually gets the most hype. But Prather says all phases, from the lightest slumber to the deepest unconsciousness, are important processes that allow our brains and bodies to recover from the previous day and can help us learn and remember information better.
Getting rest isn‚Äôt always as simple as climbing into bed and shutting off the lights. Circadian rhythms, hormones like melatonin, and even the neurotransmitter dopamine play a role. There‚Äôs still a lot scientists don‚Äôt understand about what happens when we drift off, but the more we learn, the more important sleep becomes.
Whether a cause or a symptom, abnormal sleep plays a role in diseases like Alzheimer‚Äôs and Parkinson‚Äôs. Measuring disturbed sleep could be one way to detect the onset of neurodegenerative diseases. Eventually, medicines that help promote more natural sleep cycles could help treat those very diseases. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm excited about the future of sleep medicine,‚Äù says Prather. Instead of thinking of sleep as a nuisance, maybe we‚Äôll start finally seeing it for what it actually is: a necessity.
