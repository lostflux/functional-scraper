Twitter mobile-products-and-partnerships guy Kevin Thau blogged this morning that the company has been working for eight months with Seattle-based Cloudhopper to build a large-scale SMS system for distributing tweets. Now, Twitter has acquired the company, in order “to connect directly to mobile carrier networks in countries all over the planet.” “Twitter processes close to a billion SMS tweets per month and that number is growing around the world from Indonesia to Australia, the UK, the US, and beyond,” Thau wrote. “Twitter was inspired by SMS and we continue to embrace this simple but ubiquitous technology.” Note to startups: This is how you get acquired by a bigger company. Partner with them first.
