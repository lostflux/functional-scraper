Update at 1:36 p.m. PT: Twitter has confirmed the acquisition via a blog post Social network Twitter has reportedly acquired mobile advertising technology firm Tap Commerce.
The social network apparently paid about $100 million for Tap Commerce.
Re/code broke the news, and Twitter is expected to make an official announcement later today.
Tap Commerce does re-targeting for mobile app makers — meaning that it helps them get their users to reopen and reengage with apps. It counts Pocket Gems, eBay, Poshmark, and Hotel.com among its customers.
Twitter has recently been doubling down on its advertising, especially in mobile. It has expanded the available lead cards as well as its advertising offerings for advertisers. This is likely a play in continuing to build out its revenue stream from mobile ads.
VentureBeat's mission is to be a digital town square for technical decision-makers to gain knowledge about transformative enterprise technology and transact.
