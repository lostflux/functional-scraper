Photograph: Ronald Wittek/EPA Books ‘The potential to undermine democracy’: European publishing trade bodies call for action on generative AI Three organisations argue that more transparency is needed after research found AI models have been trained using pirated works by authors such as Zadie Smith and Stephen King Thu 19 Oct 2023 09.53 EDT Three major European publishing trade bodies have urged the EU to “act now” on transparency over artificial intelligence for the sake of “the book chain and democracy”.
As the world’s largest book fair began in Frankfurt, an online statement published on Wednesday called for co-legislators to “seize the opportunity” of the EU’s AI act – which classifies AI systems according to the risk they pose to users and applies regulation accordingly – to “ensure the transparency” of generative AI and “make it safer for European citizens”.
The European Writers’ Council, the Federation of European Publishers and the European and International Booksellers Federation signed the statement. It comes after analysis by The Atlantic revealed that the pirated works of authors such as Zadie Smith and Stephen King had been used to train artificial intelligence tools run by companies including Meta and Bloomberg.
“Generative AI models have been developed in an opaque and unfair way, illegally making use of millions of copyright-protected books without permission from authors or publishers,” read the statement. “This practice impacts negatively not only rightsholders, but also democracy itself, by facilitating the mass creation of misleading, biased, and even dangerous content which has the potential to undermine European democracy.” Sign up to Bookmarks Free weekly newsletter Discover new books with our expert reviews, author interviews and top 10s.

after newsletter promotion The trio of organisations argued that transparency is essential to the development of a “fair and safe AI ecosystem” and said the AI act is an “ideal opportunity” for the EU to take a “leading role in protecting its citizens”. If passed, the legislation would be the first comprehensive legal framework for AI regulation.
Under the act, due to be finalised by the end of the year, AI systems are classified into four groups based on the risks they pose to users: unacceptable, high, limited, and minimal or no risk. For foundation models – which underpin generative AI tools like ChatGPT – companies would be required to disclose a detailed summary of data sources used for training.
The three trade bodies said that this proposed requirement is a “good first step” and called on member states and the Commission to “improve the proposal and finally put an end to the illegal sourcing and data-laundering abuses of generative AI developers”. They added that transparency is “the only way to ensure quality and legitimacy of outputs”.
“Meaningful transparency obligations allowing a rightsholder to assess whether their work was used are easy for the innovative AI operators to comply with,” continued the statement. “They are technologically simple to apply and rely on data that AI developers already collect and organise. And they are needed now, as damage is already done since existing generative text models used works [for] years without consent, credit or compensation to the authors and publishers.” Explore more on these topics Books Europe Frankfurt book fair Publishing Artificial intelligence (AI) news More on this story More on this story Sam Altman ‘was working on new venture’ before sacking from OpenAI 7h ago John Legend and Sia among singers to trial AI versions of voices with YouTube 3d ago Like horses laid off by the car: BT tech chief’s AI job losses analogy draws anger 9 Nov 2023 AI could cause ‘catastrophic’ financial crisis, says Yuval Noah Harari 9 Nov 2023 ‘A kind of magic’: Peter Blake says possibilities of AI are endless for art 5 Nov 2023 Elon Musk unveils Grok, an AI chatbot with a ‘rebellious streak’ 5 Nov 2023 No utopia: experts question Elon Musk’s vision of world without work 3 Nov 2023 ‘Bletchley made me more optimistic’: how experts reacted to AI summit 3 Nov 2023 AI could pose risk to humanity on scale of nuclear war, Sunak warns 2 Nov 2023 When Musk met Sunak: the prime minister was more starry-eyed than a SpaceX telescope 3 Nov 2023 … … Most viewed Most viewed World Europe US Americas Asia Australia Middle East Africa Inequality Global development News Opinion Sport Culture Lifestyle About us Help Complaints & corrections SecureDrop Work for us Privacy policy Cookie policy Terms & conditions Contact us All topics All writers Digital newspaper archive Facebook YouTube Instagram LinkedIn Twitter Newsletters Advertise with us Guardian Labs Search jobs Back to top
