Good news: You can make it work, even if you're separated from your regular yoga studio. It doesn't take much to get started. I spoke with Jessamyn Stanley , founder of The Underbelly and author of Every Body Yoga , for advice on how to begin turning your home into a one-person yoga studio.

Lululemon Reversible Mat.
Photograph: Lululemon If you're just starting out with yoga, get a cheap mat, literally from anywhere. It'll force you to be more aware of your body positioning to keep from sliding around, instead of relying on an ultra-grippy mat to compensate for bad form.
"It's not a good idea to spend a lot of money right out the gate," Stanley says. "Sometimes if you start with a really good mat, you don‚Äôt learn all the really important foundational, tactical body things that are really necessary to have a more advanced physical practice." Once you start to grasp yoga principles, Stanley says it's time to step up to a better mat. She likes the Lululemon Reversible Mat ($88) , which is what she considers a starting point for ‚Äúgood mats.‚Äù Want the perfect mat? Shell out for the Jade Yoga Fusion Mat ($135).
Regardless of the mat, you're going to get it sweaty, so throw a towel over it. Stanley doesn't think yoga towels are worth it, so use a regular bathing towel, preferably one that's been washed a few times, because a brand-new one will be more slippery.
Muji oil diffuser.
Photograph: Muji Aside from making enough room around your mat so you won't bang elbows on any furniture, a yoga space needs to be inviting, even if it's just a temporary clearing on the living room floor with the coffee table pushed back. Try to make one spot your regular yoga area. Having a certain part of the home become familiar as your yoga space can help ease you into the mindset that you're exiting the workday and ignoring other flashy living room distractions‚Äînow it's time for yoga.

This is the easiest step, because as long as it doesn't get in your way or distract you, it's fair game. Scents might help put you in the right headspace, too. You can set up candles , burn incense, or use an oil diffuser.
 Lavender and sage are especially prized for potentially relaxing effects. Adding indoor greenery with houseplants is one of Stanley's favorite ways to decorate a yoga space.
Anything that speaks to you and makes you relax into a state of mind that lets you begin to focus on yoga will do. You can even meditate before you switch to yoga. Your home meditation space can double as your yoga space.
Photograph: Bobby Quillard Locate your space near a window or skylight. Natural light boosts the release of serotonin, one of the chemicals that makes us feel happy and relaxed. If windows aren't an option, you can use smart bulbs and tweak brightness and hues when you're ready for yoga.

Or try a sunrise alarm , which mimics natural sunrises and sunsets to put you at ease.
If loud neighbors, roommates, or street noise keep you from focusing, buy a sound machine to drown them out. The LectroFan Classic is our favorite, because it has 10 fan sounds and 10 varieties of white, pink, and brown noise. Even silence can be deafening sometimes, so it can come in handy if you need some background noise to focus on your yoga.
Gaiam Yoga Essentials Block.

 There are going to be times that, no matter how good your form and strength are, you're going to wish your arms were a bit longer to pull off a pose. That's where a block comes in handy. When you need to plant a hand on the floor but aren't flexible enough to reach, the block will allow you to brace yourself.

It's the most useful and ubiquitous prop. "It's not about assisting the practice," Stanley says. "It's about deepening the practice." Other options are bolsters , which are large cushions used for support in various positions where you wouldn't want to use a hard block, and straps , which can help you reach your feet in poses where you need extra flexibility.
Like with the mat and towel, you can use stuff lying around the house as alternatives if you want to save money while you're still new to yoga. Tape cardboard boxes together to make blocks. Use books or a couch cushion. Stanley has even used a trash can as a block and her dog's leash as a yoga strap. You really don't need to buy stuff to practice yoga, she says, although once you start improvising equipment you'll start to realize the virtue in buying gear made for yoga.
Photograph: Lululemon "You should practice as close to naked as possible," Stanley says. If you're comfortable practicing naked, do that. If you can't because you're sharing your home or just aren't down with the idea of it, then practice in your underwear. I use these ExOfficio boxer briefs for hiking, but the synthetic, stretchy fabric is tight-fitting but flexible: perfect for yoga. The women's version is similarly made.

Go for tighter yoga clothes instead of loose, baggy clothing. Tighter yoga pants let you be more aware of your body positioning and less concerned about extra fabric getting in your way. There are fewer yoga pant options for men than for women.
 A lot of what's marketed toward men is loose-fitting, which hangs and gets caught up while positioning yourself.
It's easier to find a T-shirt in your wardrobe that'll work for yoga, but it could still help to buy one with some stretch in the material to prevent it from restricting your movements. Yoga clothes are expensive, but you don't need to spend big. Uniqlo has affordable, tight-fitting pants marketed as leggings for women and tights for men that will work just fine for yoga.
