Our GamesBeat Summit 2019 has come and gone. We learned about reinvention and communities , about dealing with games that launch to huge audiences and rabid response — and how to communicate with them better.
 We gave one of the speakers, Insomniac Games’ Ted Price, a visionary award for his contributions to the game industry over the past quarter-decade.
And you can see the Day One agenda here.
