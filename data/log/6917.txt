Ultimately, your budget should reflect your laptop's primary use case(s) and your preferred operating system. Here's what you can expect at different price ranges:<\/p> Laptops that cost $300 to $600 <\/strong>are budget Windows notebooks and Chromebooks reserved for word processing, web browsing, and email sending. Models on the lower end of this price range tend to be clunkers with pokey Intel Celeron N Series CPUs and eMMC storage; spending a little extra can get you a sleeker machine with a better entry-level processor, more battery life, SSD storage, and a backlit keyboard.<\/p><\/li> Laptops that cost $600 to $1,000<\/strong> are mostly Windows models and high-end Chromebooks with crisper displays and mid-range CPUs that are good for schoolwork, streaming, and casual gaming.<\/p><\/li> Laptops priced at $1,000 to $1,500<\/strong> are peppy Windows ultrabooks, MacBooks, and gaming laptops with plenty of storage, bright, pretty displays, enough power for light photo and video editing, and great graphics. <\/p><\/li> Laptops that cost more than $1,500<\/strong> are beautiful, beefy, and blazing-fast MacBooks Pros and Windows desktop replacements geared toward professional content creation and intense gaming. (They're probably overkill for the average person.)<\/p><\/li><\/ul> If you want to stretch your budget beyond these usual constraints, bookmark our "https:\/\/mashable.com\/article\/black-friday-laptop-deals-2023\" target=\"_self\">roundup of the best Black Friday laptop deals<\/a> across major retailers and tech manufacturers: We're updating it constantly with new deals as we find them.<\/p>"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What size laptop should I be looking for?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":" If you commute daily or "https:\/\/mashable.com\/roundup\/best-laptop-backpacks\" target=\"_self\"> travel<\/u><\/a> often, a lightweight, slim, and compact laptop in the 11- to 13-inch range will serve you best.

It impressed us in our testing, but with a starting price of $799.99, it's a tad too expensive to be our top budget pick. The Surface Laptop Go 2 still holds the title for now, but we're currently testing other contenders as its specs are getting outdated.
We're also re-evaluating the 16-inch, M2 Max-powered MacBook Pro as our top pick for multimedia editing, as Apple just replaced it with an M3 Max model.
Shop Black Friday laptop deals: Amazon Best Buy Target Walmart Shoppers will encounter a lot of fantastic Black Friday laptop deals heading into the holiday season, making late fall one of the best times of the year to upgrade. But picking the right PC to add to your cart can be a complicated decision: Not all laptop brands or specs are created equal, and the sheer number of models out there is enough to make anyone's head spin. (To put things in perspective, Apple 's lineup now includes three MacBook Airs and two MacBook Pros across three generations of M-something chips.) Ultimately, choosing the right laptop for you will come down to three main questions: How are you going to be using your laptop? What's your preferred operating system â€” macOS, Windows, or ChromeOS ? And perhaps most importantly, how much are you willing to spend? If you're hatching a game plan for Black Friday 2023, know that the bulk of the best laptop deals will be found on brands' direct websites or at Best Buy; the electronics retailer tends to put MacBooks , high-end Windows models, and premium gaming PCs on sale at deep discounts this time of year. Those who prioritize bargains over current specs should also keep an eye on Walmart, which has sold older and discontinued laptops for well under $100 on Black Fridays past.

 But we'd go broader and recommend it as the best Apple laptop for pretty much anyone.
Powered by Apple's zippy M2 chip with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of SSD storage to start, this all-aluminum laptop "delivers everything you need any job centered around using a computer," writes tech and games reporter Alex Perry. That includes a "solid battery life, a larger 13.6-inch display than previous models , a keyboard thatâ€™s to die for, and enough horsepower to handle everyday tasks with ease." Other highlights include a 1080p FaceTime HD camera that produces a clear picture in low light and a four-speaker setup with Spatial Audio and Dolby Atmos support. It could use more ports and a better refresh rate, but as a complete package, it's a winner of our Mashable's Choice Award and a worthy upgrade from any older MacBook you're still holding onto.
As of 2023 , the M2 MacBook Air also now comes in a 15-inch model with two extra speakers starting at $1,299.

$1,099 from Best Buy The Good Lightweight and thin All-day battery life Great keyboard Apple's M2 chip is speedy 1080p HD webcam Also available in 15-inch configuration The Bad Could use more ports 60Hz refresh rate Details Processor: Apple M2 Graphics processor: Apple M2 8-core RAM: 8GB Storage: 256GB SSD Screen: 13.6-inch Liquid Retina display Resolution: 2560 x 1664 Refresh rate: 60Hz Touchscreen: No Webcam: Yes (1080p FaceTime HD) Ports: Two USB-C/Thunderbolt ports, headphone jack, MagSafe 3 charging port Battery life: Up to 18 hours Weight: 2.7 pounds Microsoft Surface Laptop Go 2 Best budget laptop Priced at $700 but now on clearance for around $550, the 2022 Microsoft Surface Laptop Go 2 is the best budget laptop for users who don't want a total clunker. It's actually a pretty decent aesthetic dupe for an Apple MacBook Air, says Mashable contributor Callum Bains, with a stylish and slim design that features an aluminum lid (available in four finishes).
The specs under the Surface Laptop Go 2's hood are indisputably mediocre and not at all MacBook-y, but they're sufficient for its price point: It runs on a mid-range 11th-gen Intel Core i5 processor with 8GB of memory, and it starts out with 128GB of SSD storage (which you can replace and upgrade down the road). Those are some good improvements over the Intel Celeron N Series CPUs, 4GB of RAM, and sluggish eMMC (embedded MultiMediaCard) flash storage you'll find in many laptops under $500. Its 12.4-inch, 3:2 PixelSense touchscreen display has a not-great resolution of 1536 x 1024 pixels, or just under Full HD, but it's bright and clear enough for most settings. When you factor in its "serviceable" webcam and "respectable" battery life, per Bains, you've got a decent all-rounder for basic web browsing and streaming that looks more expensive than it really is.

$699.99 from Microsoft Store The Good Decent battery life Comes in four finishes Bright touchscreen Lightweight and sleek Replaceable/upgradable SSD The Bad Unimpressive webcam Low-res display A tinge overpriced at MSRP â€” we recommend finding it on sale Details Processor: Intel Core i5-1135G7 Graphics processor: Intel Iris Xe RAM: 8GB Storage: 128GB SSD Screen: 12.4-inch PixelSense display Resolution: 1536 x 1024 Refresh rate: 60Hz Touchscreen: Yes Webcam: Yes (720p) Ports: USB-C port, USB-A port, headphone jack, Surface Connect port Battery life: Up to 13.5 hours Weight: 2.48 pounds Dell XPS 15 (9530) Best Windows laptop The newest version of the Dell XPS 15 is a 15.6-inch machine from the brand's premium laptop line with solid build quality, a beautiful edge-to-edge display, and specs that can crush everyday tasks right out of the gate. (Its base configuration easily justifies its $1,499 price tag with a 13th-generation Intel Core i7 H-series processor, 512GB of storage, 16GB of RAM, and an Intel Arc A370M GPU.) For those in need of even more oomph, optional upgrades like NVIDIA GeForce graphics for gaming, up to 4TB of storage, up to 64GB of RAM, and a vivid OLED touchscreen will turn the XPS 15 into a bona fide desktop replacement.
The experts over at PCMag (owned by Mashable's publisher, Ziff Davis) gave the XPS 15 a 4.5/5 rating and an Editor's Choice distinction, calling it "one of the best and most flexible luxe laptops for a range of audiences" despite their disappointment with its 720p webcam and limited selection of ports. (It does come with a free USB-C to USB-A and HDMI adapter, at least.) Note that the base XPS 15 has a lackluster listed battery life of up to nine hours, but the PCMag team was able to squeeze over 14 hours of use out of its upgraded testing unit.
$1,499 from Dell.com The Good Excellent build quality Fast 13th-generation Intel Core CPU Good amount of storage and RAM Pretty edge-to-edge display Lots of optional upgrades available Included adapter makes up for limited ports The Bad Lousy 720p webcam 60Hz refresh rate A bit heavy Battery life could be better Details Processor: Intel Core i7-13700H Graphics processor: Intel Arc A370M RAM: 16GB Storage: 512SSD Screen: 15.6-inch FHD+ InfinityEdge display Resolution: 1920 x 1200 Refresh rate: 60Hz Touchscreen: No Webcam: Yes (720p) Ports: Two Thunderbolt 4 ports, USB-C port, headset jack; includes USB-C to USB-A and HDMI adapter Battery life: Up to 9 hours Weight: 4.21 pounds Lenovo Yoga 9i Best 2-in-1 laptop For those who can't decide between a laptop or a tablet, the refined Yoga 9i from Lenovo's popular line of convertibles is everything you could want in both devices. Its star attraction is a vibrant 14-inch OLED touchscreen with a welcome 90Hz refresh rate (plus the option to upgrade to 4K ), which flips on a 360-degree hinge around its attached keyboard to switch between the two different modes. It can also be propped up like a tent for movie-watching. Notably, it comes with a rechargeable stylus for drawing and sketching â€” the $59.99 Lenovo Precision Pen 2 â€” so there's no need to buy one separately.
The base configuration of the Yoga 9i includes a 13th-gen Intel Core i7 processor with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage to breeze through multitasking. The rest of the features on its spec sheet are equally impressive, from its 1080p webcam to the Bowers & Wilkins speaker bar with Dolby Atmos support. It should come as no surprise that it's an Editor's Choice pick over at PCMag , which deemed it "the premium 2-in-1 laptop to buy." It could use a battery bump the next time Lenovo revisits it, but that's a minor gripe somewhat nullified by its fast-charging feature.

The 2023 Lenovo Legion Slim 7i's new 13th-gen Intel Core i9 processor and NVIDIA GeForce RTX 40 Series graphics can plow through AAA titles with no problem, and its vibrant 16-inch, 16:10 PureSight display has a 240Hz refresh rate for silky-smooth gameplay. (There's also an HDMI output if you want to connect it to a separate monitor.) It comes with a full-sized RGB-backlit keyboard with a full numpad and interchangeable WASD keycaps, plus built-in Harman speakers for immersive sound.
Four-and-a-half pounds is a little hefty for a traditional laptop, but for a gaming machine, the Legion Slim 7i sits comfortably in a featherweight class. If you're in the market for a gaming laptop that's basically a portable rig, look no further â€” but be prepared to pay up, as it retails for $2,099.99. (On the plus side, it does include a three-month Xbox Game Pass subscription.) "Itâ€™s an investment for sure, but a more sensible one than most," writes Mashable contributor Bains, who tested the previous model. Keep an eye out for discounts on it at Best Buy.

$2,099.99 from Best Buy The Good Comes with free three-month Xbox Game Pass subscription Speedy 13th-generation Intel Core i9 CPU Latest NVIDIA GeForce RTX 40 series GPU 240Hz refresh rate Full-sized RGB backlit keyboard with customizable keycaps 1080p webcam with privacy shutter HDMI output for connecting a monitor The Bad On the heavier side (but decent for a gaming laptop) Expensive Details Processor: Intel Core i9-13900H Graphics processor: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 RAM: 16GB Storage: 1TB SSD Screen: 16-inch PureSight display Resolution: 2560 x 1600 Refresh rate: Up to 240Hz Touchscreen: No Webcam: Yes (1080p with shutter) Ports: Three USB-A ports, Thunderbolt 4 port, USB-C port, headphone jack, HDMI port, SD card reader Battery life: Up to 12 hours Weight: 4.4 pounds Acer Chromebook Spin 714 Best Chromebook The new Acer Chromebook Spin 714 is doing its best to shed this category's dinky and cheap associations, marrying competent mid-range specs like a 13th-gen Intel Core i5 processor, 8GB of RAM, 256GB of SSD storage, and a QHD webcam with ChromeOS security features (including automatic updates and cloud data storage). It's also managed to translate that signature Chromebook ruggedness into a sleek 2-in-1 design: Its build is rated for military-grade shock resistance , and its 14-inch touchscreen and touchpad are made with Antimicrobial Corning Gorilla Glass that may protect them from lingering stains and odors. It should make your shortlist if you're hunting for a basic, user-friendly laptop the whole family can use.
While this particular model hasn't been hands-on tested by Mashable or PCMag yet, the latter gave last year's Chromebook Spin 714 a 4.5/5 and an Editor's Choice Award for its 16:10 display ("a great balance between work and play"), 1080p shuttered webcam, durable metal chassis, and garaged stylus. The 2023 version has unfortunately ditched the stylus, but its upgraded processor, improved webcam, and slightly lower price maintains its overall excellence in our book.

The Framework Laptop 13 is the latest version of a previous Mashable's Choice Award-winning device that's specifically designed to be fixable by you at home, even if you have zero prior experience with DIY repairs, with replaceable CPUs, memory, storage, keyboards, displays, and even expansion cards for ports. What's more, these components can all be individually upgraded whenever Framework introduces new ones â€” it doesn't get more future-proof than that.
The pre-built, ready-to-use Framework Laptop 13 features a new 13.5-inch matte display, improved hinges, and a better battery life than the previous iterations, and it starts with a 13th-gen Intel Core i5 processor, 8GB of RAM, 256GB of SSD storage, and Windows 11 Home. You can also opt for the DIY Edition , which can be customized with the specs (even operating system) of your choosing.

 This 16-inch, recycled aluminum laptop combines that formidable in-house silicone with a gorgeous Liquid Retina XDR display (a mini-LED screen with ProMotion technology, aka a 120Hz refresh rate), a 38-core GPU, an industry-leading 22-hour battery life, and a solid port selection with support for WiFi 6E and 8K displays. It prices out most users at $3,499 for the base configuration with 32GB of RAM and 1TB of storage â€” ouch â€” but according to PCMag , it's well worth that steep cost for professional creatives who run intense software on a regular basis.
"Sure, we can nitpick about the screen notch or the lack of touch capability, but the fact of the matter is that this is as close to perfect as any laptop we have reviewed," writes our sister site (which gave it an extremely rare 5/5 score and an Editor's Choice nod). "The machine looks and feels fantastic, and it will rip through the most demanding computing tasks like a buzzsaw." $3,499 from Best Buy The Good Unrivaled speed and power Backlit Magic Keyboard with Touch ID Supports WiFi 6E Good connectivity (works with 8K displays) Absolutely stunning display Ridiculously long battery life The Bad So expensive Heavy Details Processor: Apple M2 Max Graphics processor: Apple M2 Max 38-core RAM: 32GB Storage: 1TB SSD Screen: 16.2-inch Liquid Retina XDR display Resolution: 3456 x 2234 Refresh rate: Up to 120Hz Touchscreen: No Webcam: Yes (1080p FaceTime HD) Ports: Three Thunderbolt 4 ports, HDMI port, SDXC card slot, headphone jack, MagSafe 3 port Battery life: Up to 22 hours Weight: 4.8 pounds Microsoft Surface Laptop Studio Best laptop for artists The Microsoft Surface Laptop Studio 2 is, as its name suggests, a laptop. But the unique pull-forward design of its 120Hz, 14.4-inch touchscreen display means it can also "transform into a digital easel and a tablet," says Mashable tech editor Kim Gedeon, "[making] it an artist's playground." Just like its predecessor from 2021, it's an especially versatile device for content creation â€” though it still doesn't come bundled with a stylus, which feels like a silly omission on Microsoft's part. (It does have built-in storage and charging for the Surface Slim Pen 2 , at least.) Speaking of: While the original Surface Laptop Studio was a great laptop, it was pretty outdated by the time its successor arrived in October 2023. This second iteration fortunately features a slew of big upgrades like 13th-gen Intel Core H-Series CPUs, optional NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4050, 4060, or RTX 2000 GPUs, and the first Intel Neural Processing Unit in a Windows computer. (The latter adds "Windows Studio Effects" to its 1080p webcam, including blur and eye contact features). Microsoft also equipped it with a much-needed wider variety of ports and a silky-smooth haptic touchpad that has an adaptive touch mode for users with limited mobility. It is quite a bit heavier than its predecessor, so it'll probably pass on plein air doodling sessions in favor of staying parked on your desk.

Meanwhile, the experts at our sister site, PCMag (which is owned by Mashable's publisher, Ziff Davis), have thoroughly reviewed the Dell XPS 15, the Lenovo Yoga 9i, the M2 Max MacBook Pro, and last year's Acer Chromebook Spin 714.
Each model snagged a spot on this best laptop guide for different reasons related to their specific use cases, but all of them hail from reputable brands and provide solid value for their features, with specs that should last you for years to come. They also have reliable availability and are easily found in stock on their brand/manufacturer's website or at major retailers as of 2023.
The specific specs we took into consideration when choosing these laptops include the following: Processor: The central processing unit (or CPU ) is a chip inside a laptop's motherboard that's responsible for executing all tasks and commands â€” it's often referred to as the machine's brain or control center. The newer and more powerful it is, the faster your laptop will be.
Graphics processor: The graphics processing unit (or GPU ) is a specialized chip that's responsible for rendering visuals. It's especially important for gaming and photo/video editing.
RAM: A laptop's random-access memory is where it temporarily stashes the data its CPU needs for any active applications. The more RAM a machine has, the more tasks it can handle simultaneously.
Storage: A laptop's storage is where it keeps long-term data. SSD ( solid-state drive ) storage is faster than is eMMC ( embedded MultiMediaCard ) flash storage, and 256GB is going to be a good starting point for most people.
Resolution: The higher your screen's resolution, the sharper its picture is going to be. Full HD (or 1920 x 1080 pixels) should be your baseline if you're going to be using your laptop for streaming or gaming.
Refresh rate: A laptop screen's refresh rate (measured in hertz) refers to the number of times it updates its picture per second; the higher the refresh rate, the smoother motion looks. 60Hz is pretty average for an everyday laptop, while nice gaming laptops range from 120Hz to 480Hz.
Webcam: While still pretty common in newer laptops, 720p cameras are just passable. We recommend aiming for 1080p (Full HD) if you plan on using your computer for regular video calls.
Ports: Different types of ports let you connect different accessories and peripherals to your laptop (like headphones and monitors).
Battery life: Eight to ten hours should get you through a day's work or play, but generally speaking, more is more.
Weight: Laptops that weigh three pounds or less will be easiest to take on the go, but usually less powerful than their heftier peers.
Frequently Asked Questions How much should I spend on a new laptop? Ultimately, your budget should reflect your laptop's primary use case(s) and your preferred operating system. Here's what you can expect at different price ranges: Laptops that cost $300 to $600 are budget Windows notebooks and Chromebooks reserved for word processing, web browsing, and email sending. Models on the lower end of this price range tend to be clunkers with pokey Intel Celeron N Series CPUs and eMMC storage; spending a little extra can get you a sleeker machine with a better entry-level processor, more battery life, SSD storage, and a backlit keyboard.
Laptops that cost $600 to $1,000 are mostly Windows models and high-end Chromebooks with crisper displays and mid-range CPUs that are good for schoolwork, streaming, and casual gaming.
Laptops priced at $1,000 to $1,500 are peppy Windows ultrabooks, MacBooks, and gaming laptops with plenty of storage, bright, pretty displays, enough power for light photo and video editing, and great graphics.
Laptops that cost more than $1,500 are beautiful, beefy, and blazing-fast MacBooks Pros and Windows desktop replacements geared toward professional content creation and intense gaming. (They're probably overkill for the average person.) If you want to stretch your budget beyond these usual constraints, bookmark our roundup of the best Black Friday laptop deals across major retailers and tech manufacturers: We're updating it constantly with new deals as we find them.
What size laptop should I be looking for? If you commute daily or travel often, a lightweight, slim, and compact laptop in the 11- to 13-inch range will serve you best. If you're a huge movie buff, a gamer, or a creator who doesn't normally take their laptop on the road with them, you can bulk up to a 15- to 17-inch model with heft that affords it more power.
Is a cheap laptop worth it? You get what you pay for, but some brands' cheap laptops can take you pretty far these days, and certain use cases don't necessitate the latest or most powerful specs. For more intel, check out our guides to the best budget laptops under $500 and best budget laptops under $300.
