Sony revealed the free PlayStation Plus games that subscribers can download in March. This includes Final Fantasy VII Remake.
 It’ll be available starting on March 2.

The other March titles include: Event GamesBeat at the Game Awards We invite you to join us in LA for GamesBeat at the Game Awards event this December 7. Reserve your spot now as space is limited!
