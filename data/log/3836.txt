Downloads top 30 million. They’ve been on the beat for a decade. And if you’re looking for a highly-rated, well-reviewed VPN service to handle all your online protection worries, Private Internet Access needs to be among any smart shopper’s first stops.
But even with that pedigree, fans of fast, reliable, secure web crawling can rest assured that PIA hasn’t been coasting on those past glories. Right now, this veteran security option is available at a surprisingly low price for such an industry stalwart, over 70 percent off.
PIA routinely places among the top VPN providers in customer satisfaction, most directly for doing what its users purchase it to do — protect them from anything and everything that could be a problem online.
Logging into their vast network of more than 35,000 servers in over 100 locations across 78 countries, users always enjoyed blisteringly fast, fully encrypted unmonitored web access.
Even as they’ve expanded their network recently, PIA’s primary mission remains shielding users, their IP address, and their sensitive information from scams, cyber thieves and online snoops, and more. And now that PIA boasts the world’s largest global server network, users are never forced to trade speed for security either.
That vast server network also makes it easier than ever to get around international content restrictions on censored or geographically blocked websites, apps, or streaming services. With PIA, your U.S.-based Netflix account is accessible anywhere in the world you go, while content restricted to another part of the world can be yours to watch just by logging into that home region.
Meanwhile, PIA is also ramping up its user experience protections too, like their improved MACE feature, which blocks ads, trackers, and malware. And users can cloak up to 10 devices simultaneously on one PIA subscription, just one of the reasons they’re a PC Mag Editor’s Choice selection, a CNET’s Best VPN Services of 2021 honoree, and holder of a solid 4.6 out of 5-star rating from more than 100,000 reviews in both the Apple App Store and Google Play.
All those features and accolades also come with a heavy discount right now with a 2-year subscription to Private Internet Access available now for only $69.95, a savings of 72 percent off the regular price.
