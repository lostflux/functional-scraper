Konami has killed Silent Hills and its playable P.T. teaser, but the spirit lives on.
Aspiring game developer Farhan Qureshi has spent 104 hours re-creating the hallway from Hideo Kojima’s horror-filled PlayStation 4 Silent Hills teaser. It’s not a complete version of P.T. — which Konami has now pulled from the PlayStation Store — but Qureshi has done a great job of building a similarly tense atmosphere using limited resources. You can download and try it out on PC, Mac, and Linux right now.
Konami’s decision to cancel the Silent Hills project was a big disappointment to a large section of the gaming community. Qureshi’s dedication to his PuniTy project (P.T. built in Unity) over four weeks — getting five hours of sleep at times — is testament to the impact of P.T., which seemed to herald a genuine return to form for the Silent Hill franchise.
Qureshi started his PuniTy project for a 3D-modelling class he’s planning to teach in September. He originally wanted to make an apartment, but he chose the P.T. hallway as it’s more game-focused. “Plus it’s no longer available to download,” he said on his website, “but I can make it live on in some fashion by doing this.” Event GamesBeat at the Game Awards We invite you to join us in LA for GamesBeat at the Game Awards event this December 7.

He grabbed reference pictures from P.T. by uploading screenshots to Twitter from his PlayStation 4. He also uploaded gameplay footage to YouTube using the PS4’s Share button, then grabbed the in-game audio in MP4 format before stripping it out and refining it.
Qureshi used some textures from the original P.T., such as photographs and the front of the radio. The rest he took from free texture resource sites or made himself. The 3D modelling was again a mixture of his own work and freely-available online assets.
“104 hours over four weeks,” mused Qureshi in summary. “Five hours of sleep on half those days; eight-hour obsession-infused modelling sessions; thinking of what I wanted to implement while dishwashing at my job.
“This was a blast.” If you don’t still have P.T. installed on your PlayStation 4’s hard drive, PuniTy is about the closest you can get to experiencing P.T.’s famously creepy hallway right now. Despite only featuring a few elements from the actual teaser, it still gave me sweaty palms as I played.
