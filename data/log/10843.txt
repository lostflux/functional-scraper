Helen shares the impact this deepfake pornography has had on her life and challenges a culture that treats women’s appearance and image as public property while the perpetrators remain anonymous.
Deepfake pornography is an increasingly common form of image-based sexual abuse and in June 2023, an amendment of the online safety bill was announced that criminalises the sharing of deepfake intimate images online.
