<< According to the latest annual State of Phishing report from SlashNext , there has been an 80% increase in phishing threats originating from accounts on trusted services such as Microsoft , Amazon Web Services or Google , with nearly one-third (32%) of all threats now being hosted on trusted services.
Additionally, the report found more than 255 million attacks in 2022 – a 61% increase in the rate of phishing attacks compared to 2021.
The report data is taken from a sample of threats detected by SlashNext security products. SlashNext analyzed over a billion link-based, malicious attachments and natural language threats scanned in email, mobile and browser channels over six months in 2022. The findings highlight a dramatic increase in phishing scams, as well as a new surface of tactics, as hybrid work and the use of personal mobile devices for work continue to be a trend.
