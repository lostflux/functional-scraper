Haven’t unlocked all the grenades yet in Battlefield 4 ? In the last days of DICE’s Battlefield 4 “Player Appreciation Month”, they’ve released a free “Grenade Shortcut Kit” on EA Origin. Even if you don’t own a copy of BF4, you can still add the kit to your EA Origin account and have all 7 grenades available to play once you decide to buy.
With last week’s release of the “Second Assault” expansion pack, it’s becoming harder and harder to avoid buying the Battlefield 4 Premium membership. Fortunately, you won’t have to pay the full $49.99, because this week GamersGate has a $10 off discount, dropping the membership to a mere $39.96. The Premium membership will get you access to all 5 expansions, which would otherwise cost $15 a pop.
If the Xbox One is your console of choice for the upcoming March 11th release Titanfall , two solid deals is available at the Microsoft Store. First off, this week they released the “Titanfall Edition” Xbox One bundle, which includes the console, Titanfall digital code, and 1 month subscription to Xbox LIVE – all for the same price as the standard Xbox One. The console bundle releases the same day as the game, but if you order before March 8th, you’ll receive the console on the March 11th release day. If you already have an Xbox One, you can preorder the Titanfall game from the Microsoft Store and get a bonus $10 Xbox Gift Card, redeemable on Xbox LIVE. If you preorder the game before 6PM PST on March 9th, you’ll get release day delivery as well.
