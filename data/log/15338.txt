Enterprise software company Atlassian today is announcing that it has acquired StatusPage , a company that offers webpages that companies can customize to show the status of their online services.
StatusPage has thousands of customers, including Alphabet’s Nest, Coinbase, Disqus, Engine Yard, Linode, Loggly, New Relic, Tesla, UserVoice, and Atlassian itself. The service will remain available for the time being.
These days, services are dependent on other services, and figuring out the service that’s causing downtime is challenging. StatusPage can help in that department.
“In a world where a single popular technology service going down could affect thousands of companies and millions of end customers, trust, transparency and up-to-the minute information on service status is an essential part of the cloud fabric,” Atlassian cofounder and co-chief executive Scott Farquhar wrote in a blog post.

Adding the sort of functionality that StatusPage offers will help Atlassian further separate itself from other companies that provide source code hosting, like GitHub and GitLab, as well as team collaboration tools like Slack and issue tracking like Trello.
StatusPage started in 2013 and is based in Denver, with 15 employees, who will be joining Australia-based Atlassian’s San Francisco office. StatusPage has been profitable since its third month of operations, an Atlassian spokesperson told VentureBeat in an email. Investors include Y Combinator , WeFunder, and FundersClub.
Atlassian went public last year.
 Previous Atlassian acquisitions include HipChat and SourceTree.
VentureBeat's mission is to be a digital town square for technical decision-makers to gain knowledge about transformative enterprise technology and transact.
