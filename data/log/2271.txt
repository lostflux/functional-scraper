Beyond the splashy news of search engine AIs having weird conversations with humans, and 2,700 new generative AI APIs flooding the market (slight exaggeration), what does AI mean for regular enterprise companies? Specifically, how are ordinary businesses implementing AI at scale? In this special issue, we look at real-life AI use cases, and efforts by companies to scale those cases. Featuring stories from end-user companies in banking, insurance, healthcare and other industries, we explore how they took the time to get their initial AI projects under control, and then were able to launch their AI transformation more ambitiously by implementing technology, processes, governance and strategy across the organization.
