Illustration: Ruby Chen October 9, 2018 Authors Larissa Schiavo Ashley Pilipiszyn Announcements , Culture & Careers Fellows and Intern programs provide an opportunity for people to work at OpenAI who are currently studying AI or wanting to transition from another speciality into AI.
Applications for the Fellows Winter 2019 are now closed—please check back later in 2019 to apply for our next cohort.
Fellows OpenAI Fellows for the February 2019 Cohort will spend the first 2 months of this program working through a specially-curated curriculum written by OpenAI’s researchers and writing a research proposal based on their interests. Fellows will then work on the project outlined in their research proposal for the following 4 months with guidance from their OpenAI mentor. This 6-month program is specifically designed for people who want to transition into conducting artificial intelligence research and apply their current domain expertise/skills.
What we’re looking for Diverse backgrounds.
 Previous fellows have come from various backgrounds spanning across genetics, software engineering, physics, and theoretical computer science.
Dedication.
 We will give priority to applicants that can join OpenAI full-time following the program.
Passion for Research.
 We want to engage with researchers and scientists who are motivated to dive into AI research and have previous research project experience.

Our interns contribute to large-scale projects like our work on Robotics and conduct their own research into AI. To get a sense of what sort of projects people work on, please check out some of the presentations from our 2018 Intern Open House.
What we’re looking for Self-Direction.
 We want to work with interns who have demonstrated an ability to guide themselves in solo work as well as contribute as a part of a team.
Practical Skills.
 While research is important, we also really value interns who are great at implementing their ideas quickly, working with a shared codebase, and communicating changes to their work with their team.
Technical & Research Experience.
 We value interns with a strong body of scientific work (especially single-author papers) as well as engineering backgrounds that can contribute to our current AI research efforts.
