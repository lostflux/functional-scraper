Photograph: Michael Short/Bloomberg/Getty Images Save this story Save Save this story Save In the 15 years since Mark Zuckerberg created Facebook , the platform has undergone more than a few costume changes. It‚Äôs grown from dorm room hijinks to measure the relative hotness of Harvard undergraduates to the online pulpit of American politics. When Facebook filed to go public in 2012, Zuckerberg explained that Facebook was never meant to be just an app, or even just a company.
 Instead, it was built to do something much more ambitious: ‚Äúto make the world more open and connected.‚Äù The scorecard on that mission is checkered.
 But, today, at least one thing is clear: Facebook, the company, is much more than just Facebook, the app‚Äîand it wants you to know it.
Facebook today introduced a brand redesign that will extend across the company‚Äôs many products, like a set of matching outfits for a family portrait. The Facebook logo now shines with new typography and an ‚Äúempathetic color palette‚Äù ‚Äîpink for Instagram, green for WhatsApp‚Äîthat features more prominently across Zuckerberg‚Äôs vast dominion. Instagram and WhatsApp will now tell you they‚Äôre ‚Äúfrom FACEBOOK,‚Äù newly in all caps, as if shouting to remind you who‚Äôs in charge.

Another blog post on the company‚Äôs design hub goes into more detail about how the team used ‚Äúcustom typography, rounded corners, open tracking and capitalization to create visual distinction between the company and the app.‚Äù This apparent faith in the world-changing power of a good font will be familiar to anyone who has ever read a design brief. ‚ÄúThe subtle softening of corners and diagonals adds a sense of optimism,‚Äù the reader is told, although it isn‚Äôt specified what we‚Äôre to be optimistic about.
All of these design tweaks add up to one clear takeaway: Facebook is more than just Big Blue. It‚Äôs the social technology that rules your life, from WhatsApp and Messenger and Instagram and Threads and Oculus and Portal and Workplace. Soon, if the company can navigate its way through a maze of regulatory and public perception challenges, it may also include Calibra, the digital wallet for its new cryptocurrency, Libra; one day, it could even include a Facebook-branded brain-computer interface. In the future, who knows what else Facebook will swallow up. Whatever it does, you won‚Äôt forget it was built by Facebook.

Zuckerberg has referred to his empire as a ‚Äúfamily‚Äù of apps for years , but recently, after a difficult couple of years at the company , those familial ties seems tighter than ever. The rebranding follows Facebook‚Äôs plan, from January, to integrate its various messaging services on the backend, which would stitch together communication on Messenger, WhatsApp, and Instagram. This summer, the company furthered this assimilation by adding the Facebook name to more of the products it owns. Instagram became ‚ÄúInstagram from Facebook,‚Äù like a designer collection sold exclusively by a big box department store.
It was curious timing for a company that is currently facing several separate antitrust investigations, from the US Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission, and 47 attorneys general across the United States. Presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has made unwinding Facebook‚Äôs various acquisitions a major part of her platform. Even Chris Hughes, Facebook‚Äôs cofounder, has called for regulators to break up the company, and has launched his own fund to support academic research and policy on antitrust matters.
Labeling the Facebook-owned apps and adding more cross-platform integration doesn‚Äôt make Facebook seem like less of a monopoly. It makes Facebook seem bigger than ever‚Äîand now with open letterforms and capitalization! But the rebrand also continues a kind of transparency that Facebook hasn‚Äôt always prioritized.
 Consider the push to #deletefacebook earlier this year, after which many migrated their social presence to Instagram, perhaps without realizing that their platform overlords remained the same. Now that connection is being slapped across products in all caps and bright colors. FACEBOOK.
The grand unification of Facebook‚Äôs products might serve as a reminder of all the ways it‚Äôs lapped up its competition and combined it into one massive communication stew. But it also signals how Facebook is trying to move forward with its family of products, as one company under one design.
That‚Äôs especially important as the Facebook app itself stalls in growth and the company struggles with its reputation. Make no mistake, it is still minting money.
 But Facebook‚Äôs future is especially reliant on the likes of Instagram, WhatsApp, and whatever else comes next. Where the new ‚Äúfrom Facebook‚Äù language once appeared quietly, subtly at the bottom of the Instagram app, it now shows up in all caps, in a font that makes it impossible to ignore‚Äîa visual representation of the idea that Facebook, the company, is only getting bigger.
