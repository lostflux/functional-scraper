Today, the vast majority host their personal email in the cloud, handing off that substantial burden to the capable security and engineering teams at companies like Google and Microsoft. Now, cybersecurity experts argue that a similar switch is due—or long overdue—for corporate and government networks. For enterprises that use on-premise Microsoft Exchange, still running their own email machine somewhere in a closet or data center, the time has come to move to a cloud service—if only to avoid the years-long plague of bugs in Exchange servers that has made it nearly impossible to keep determined hackers out.
The latest reminder of that struggle arrived earlier this week, when Taiwanese security researcher Orange Tsai published a blog post laying out the details of a security vulnerability in Microsoft Exchange. Tsai warned Microsoft about this vulnerability as early as June of 2021, and while the company responded by releasing some partial fixes, it took Microsoft 14 months to fully resolve the underlying security problem. Tsai had earlier reported a related vulnerability in Exchange that was massively exploited by a group of Chinese state-sponsored hackers known as Hafnium, which last year penetrated more than 30,000 targets by some counts. Yet according to the timeline described in Tsai’s post this week, Microsoft repeatedly delayed fixing the newer variation of that same vulnerability, assuring Tsai no fewer than four times that it would patch the bug before pushing off a full patch for months longer. When Microsoft finally released a fix, Tsai wrote, it still required manual activation and lacked any documentation for four more months.
Meanwhile, another pair of actively exploited vulnerabilities in Exchange that were revealed last month still remain unpatched after researchers showed that Microsoft’s initial attempts to fix the flaws had failed. Those vulnerabilities were just the latest in a years-long pattern of security bugs in Exchange’s code. And even when Microsoft does release Exchange patches, they’re often not widely implemented, due to the time-consuming technical process of installing them.
The result of those compounding problems, for many who have watched the hacker-induced headaches of running an Exchange server pile up, is a clear message: An Exchange server is itself a security vulnerability, and the fix is to get rid of it.
“You need to move off of on-premise Exchange forever. That’s the bottom line,” says Dustin Childs, the head of threat awareness at security firm Trend Micro’s Zero Day Initiative (ZDI), which pays researchers for finding and reporting vulnerabilities in commonly used software and runs the Pwn2Own hacking competition. “You’re not getting the support, as far as security fixes, that you would expect from a really mission-critical component of your infrastructure.” Aside from the multiple vulnerabilities Orange Tsai exposed and the two actively exploited unpatched bugs revealed last month, Childs points to another 20 security flaws in Exchange that a researcher reported to ZDI and ZDI reported to Microsoft two weeks ago, and which remain unpatched. “Exchange right now has a very broad attack surface, and it just hasn’t had a lot of really comprehensive work done on it in years from a security perspective,” says Childs.

Security podcast Risky Business went so far as to title a recent episode “ It’s Exchangehog Day ,” in a reference to the dreary cycle of vulnerability revelations and subsequent patching the servers require.
When WIRED reached out to Microsoft for comment on its Exchange security issues, Aanchal Gupta, the corporate vice president of Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC), responded with an exhaustive list of measures the company has taken to mitigate, patch, and harden on-premise Exchange servers. She noted that Microsoft quickly released updates in response to Tsai's findings to partially block the vulnerabilities he exposed before the company released the full fix in August. Gupta further wrote that MSRC “worked around the clock” to help customers update their Exchange servers in the midst of last year’s Hafnium attacks, released numerous security updates for Exchange over the year, and even launched an Exchange Emergency Mitigation service, which helps customers automatically apply security mitigations to block known attacks on Exchange servers even before a full patch is available.
Still, Gupta agreed that most customers should move from on-premise Exchange servers to Microsoft's cloud-based email service, Exchange Online. “We strongly recommend customers migrate to the cloud to take advantage of real-time security and instant updates to help keep their systems protected from the latest threats,” Gupta said in an emailed statement. “Our work to support on-premises customers to move to a supported and up-to-date version continues, and we strongly advise customers who cannot keep these systems up to date to migrate to the cloud.” If email administrators are, in fact, having trouble keeping Exchange fully patched, Trend Micro's Childs says that's due largely to the complexity of actually installing Exchange updates, both because of the age of its code and the risks of breaking functionality by changing interdependent mechanisms in the software. Security researcher Kevin Beaumont, for instance, recently live-tweeted his own experience of updating an Exchange server , documenting countless bugs, crashes, and hiccups in the process, which took him nearly three hours, despite the fact the server had last been updated just a few months earlier. “It’s a difficult and arduous process, so even though there are active attacks, people just don’t patch their on-premise Exchange,” says Childs. “So there are patched bugs that are taking forever to get fixed, and also unpatched bugs that have yet to get fixed.” Business What Sam Altman’s Firing Means for the Future of OpenAI Steven Levy Business Sam Altman’s Sudden Exit Sends Shockwaves Through OpenAI and Beyond Will Knight Gear Humanity’s Most Obnoxious Vehicle Gets an Electric (and Nearly Silent) Makeover Boone Ashworth Security The Startup That Transformed the Hack-for-Hire Industry Andy Greenberg Another problem compounding on-premise Exchange’s security woes arises from the fact that vulnerabilities found in its software are often particularly easy to exploit. Exchange bugs aren’t any more common than, say, vulnerabilities in Microsoft’s Remote Desktop Protocol, says Marcus Hutchins, an analyst for security firm Kryptos Logic. But they’re far more reliable to use because, despite the fact that an Exchange server hosts email locally, it’s accessed through a web service. And passing commands through an online interface to a web server is a far more reliable form of hacking than methods like so-called memory corruption vulnerabilities, which have to alter data in a lower-level and less predictable portion of a targeted machine. “It’s basically very fancy web exploitation,” says Hutchins. “It’s not something that’s going to crash the server if you do it wrong. It’s very stable and simple.” That exploitability is compounded by what seems to be Microsoft’s increasing inattention to maintaining the security of on-premise Exchange in favor of its cloud-based email service, 365 Exchange Online. As Beaumont pointed out earlier this month, Microsoft itself recommended that customers disable “legacy” authentication for Exchange—using industry jargon for outdated and often unsupported features—without acknowledging that there was no alternative form of authentication available.
That’s a strong hint that Microsoft itself thinks of on-premise Exchange servers on the whole as de facto “legacy” products, says Jake Williams, a former National Security Agency hacker who leads threat intelligence at cybersecurity firm Scythe. Microsoft no doubt wants customers to switch to its cloud-based service, he says, and seems to have shifted its security resources accordingly. “It’s clear the depth on the on-premise Exchange team is not where it was a few years ago and hasn’t kept up with the security landscape,” says Williams. “It’s pretty stark.” Williams acknowledges that some users may prefer or even require that their email be hosted locally rather than in the cloud for legal or privacy issues. But many enterprises that rely on the security of controlling the Exchange server themselves need to reckon with the fact they’re likely introducing more risks than they’re avoiding. “I tell customers, ‘I get it, you want to run on-prem for control reasons,’” says Williams. “But you have to start evaluating this as a liability. And that’s because Microsoft is not putting effort and resources into patching.” “The proof is in the pudding,” Williams adds. “This code base is not getting the love that it clearly and desperately needs.” And if Microsoft isn’t giving that love to your Exchange server, perhaps Exchange no longer deserves your love, either.
