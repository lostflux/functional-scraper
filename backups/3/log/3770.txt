OK, football season is far away, but we can help you enjoy the thrill of touchdowns and interceptions from the comfort of your kitchen table.
R&R Games wants to give two GamesBeat readers a copy of 1st & Goal, which distills the fun of football into a simple-to-learn board game. Each also comes with all six of the expansions, which brings the retail price of each prize package to $120.
Of course, if the whole board game thing turns you off, check out R&R Games’ Kickstarter for a digital version of 1st & Down , which will transform the same experience for mobile devices and desktop computers.
