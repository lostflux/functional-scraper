An IndabaX is a locally-organised Indaba (i.e gathering) that helps develop knowledge and capacity in machine learning and artificial intelligence in individual countries across Africa.
A Deep Learning IndabaX is a locally-organised Indaba that helps spread knowledge and builds capacity in machine learning.
Key Dates for #DLIndabaX2021: Proposals due: 08 April 2021 Notifications: 30 April 2021 Info: indabax@deeplearningindaba.com The IndabaX programme started in 2018 as an experiment in strengthening our machine learning community beyond the annual Deep Learning Indaba, to allow more people to contribute to the conversation on artificial intelligence and machine learning. We join hands across our beautiful continent. The initiative continues in 2021, and it is YOUR initiative! In 2018, we supported 13 IndabaX events that were run locally in different countries across Africa.
In 2019, the IndabaX grew to include 27 countries! The events range from roughly 50 attendees per event, up to some of the larger ones which exceeded 300, allowing our community to grow to several thousand attendees.
