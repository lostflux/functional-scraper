SoundCloud has updated its iOS app with support for Google Chromecast. The company previously only allowed casting through its Android app but has extended this feature to its iOS app and added new features.
“With SoundCloud and Google Chromecast, you can stream everything you want, the way you want, through your TV and speakers,” SoundCloud wrote in a blog post.
Now that the iOS app is on par with the Android version, all SoundCloud listeners can enjoy audio tracks and recordings on their computer or mobile device as well as on a bigger screen, which may have better speakers or, in some cases, be hooked up to a more sophisticated sound system.
You can now do more than before with the app, as the company has also enabled share playback to allow multiple users to control what’s playing. Additionally, SoundCloud Go+ subscribers are able to stream entire catalogs to their television sets. These additional features are available on both iOS and Android.
