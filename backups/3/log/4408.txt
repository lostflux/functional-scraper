Streamers have a new way to make some cash.
Gaming peripheral creator SteelSeries announced a new affiliate program today. Any streamer who takes part in it that uses SteelSeries products can earn a commission off sales made via links on their streams. With game-streaming on sites like Twitch and YouTube becoming a big industry, with millions of viewers tuning in to watch other people play (Twitch alone had a peak concurrent audience of 2.1 million people in 2015), this move gives you an idea of how game companies are evolving their advertising plans.
“To kick-start the program, SteelSeries will offer all approved, affiliate program participants who sign-up within the next 30 days — by October 30 — an industry-high rate of 8 percent on all SteelSeries peripheral sales generated from their unique links and banners,” SteelSeries detailed in a press release sent to GamesBeat.
SteelSeries specializes in mice, keyboards, headsets, and controllers for PC gaming. Other peripheral-makers, like Razer , have affiliate programs of their own, which also give streamers affiliate links to put in their pages.
