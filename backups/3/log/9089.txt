AlphaGo took the first of three scheduled games against the brash 19-year-old Chinese world number one Ke Jie, who after the match anointed the program as the new “Go god”.
AlphaGo stunned the Go community and futurists a year ago when it trounced South Korean grandmaster Lee Sedol four games to one.
 That marked the first time a computer program had beaten a top player in a full contest and was hailed as a landmark for artificial intelligence.
This week’s battle, in the eastern Chinese city of Wuzhen between Ke and an updated version of AlphaGo, was preceded by intense speculation about whether the world’s top player could be beaten by a computer.
After his defeat, a visibly flummoxed Ke – who last year declared he would never lose to an AI opponent – said AlphaGo had become too strong for humans, despite the razor-thin half-point winning margin.
Ke Jie looks glum after his defeat.
“I feel like his game is more and more like the ‘Go god’. Really, it is brilliant,” he said.
Ke vowed never again to subject himself to the “horrible experience”.
AlphaGo’s feats have fuelled visions of a new era of AI that can not only drive cars and operate smarthomes, but potentially help mankind tackle some of the most complex scientific, technical and medical problems.
Computer programs have previously beaten humans in cerebral contests, starting with the victory by IBM’s Deep Blue over chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov in 1997.
But AlphaGo’s success is considered the most significant yet for AI due to the complexity of Go, which has an incomputable number of move options and puts a premium on human-like “intuition”, instinct and the ability to learn.
Go involves two players alternately laying black and white stones on a grid, seeking to seal off the most territory.
Before AlphaGo, mechanical mastery of the game had been perceived to be years away. Its victories have been analysed and praised by students of the game as innovative and even “beautiful”, opening up new ways of approaching strategy.
AlphaGo uses two sets of “deep neural networks” containing millions of connections similar to neurons in the brain. It is partly self-taught, having played millions of games against itself following initial programming.
After Lee lost to AlphaGo last year, Ke boldly declared: “Bring it on!” But the writing was on the wall in January when Ke and other top Chinese players were flattened by a mysterious competitor in online contests.
That opponent was revealed afterwards to be the latest version of AlphaGo, which was being given an online test run by its developer, London-based AI company DeepMind Technologies, which Google acquired in 2014.
Ke, who turned professional at 11 and describes himself as pretentious, has vacillated between awe and disdain for AlphaGo. He called it a “cold machine” lacking passion for the game in comments on Monday night on China’s Twitter-like Weibo platform.
Ke and AlphaGo will face off again on Thursday and Saturday.
For some, rapid advances in AI conjure sci-fi images of a “Terminator” future in which machines “wake up” and enslave humanity. But DeepMind founder Demis Hassabis dismissed such concerns.
“This isn’t about man competing with machines, but rather using them as tools to explore and discover new knowledge together,” he said before Tuesday’s match. “Ultimately, it doesn’t matter whether AlphaGo wins or loses … either way, humanity wins.” Explore more on these topics Artificial intelligence (AI) Google Board games China Alphabet Computing Consciousness news More on this story More on this story China censored Google's AlphaGo match against world's best Go player 24 May 2017 AlphaGo beats Lee Sedol in third consecutive Go game 12 Mar 2016 Google's AlphaGo wins second game against Go champion 10 Mar 2016 … … Google's AlphaGo AI defeats human in first game of Go contest 9 Mar 2016 … … Way to Go: how Google’s computer beat the Chinese game’s world champion 9 Mar 2016 … … AlphaGo computer beats Go champion – video 9 Mar 2016 The Guardian view on robots and humanity: passing Go 9 Mar 2016 … … Google's AI machine v world champion of 'Go': everything you need to know 8 Mar 2016 … … Most viewed Most viewed US World Environment US Politics Ukraine Soccer Business Tech Science Newsletters Wellness News Opinion Sport Culture Lifestyle About us Help Complaints & corrections SecureDrop Work for us Privacy policy Cookie policy Terms & conditions Contact us All topics All writers Digital newspaper archive Facebook YouTube Instagram LinkedIn Twitter Newsletters Advertise with us Guardian Labs Search jobs Back to top
