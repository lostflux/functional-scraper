Alphabet reported $39.3 billion in revenue last quarter, up 22 percent from a year earlier. Pichai gave some of the credit to Google‚Äôs machine learning technology, saying it had figured out how to match ads more closely to what consumers wanted.
One thing Pichai didn‚Äôt mention: Alphabet is now cautioning investors that the same AI technology could create ethical and legal troubles for the company‚Äôs business. The warning appeared for the first time in the ‚ÄúRisk Factors‚Äù segment of Alphabet‚Äôs latest annual report, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission the following day: ‚Äú New products and services, including those that incorporate or utilize artificial intelligence and machine learning, can raise new or exacerbate existing ethical, technological, legal, and other challenges, which may negatively affect our brands and demand for our products and services and adversely affect our revenues and operating results.
‚Äù Companies must use the risk factors portion of their annual filings to disclose foreseeable troubles to investors. That‚Äôs supposed to keep the free market operating. It also provides companies a way to defuse lawsuits claiming management hid potential problems.
It‚Äôs not clear why Alphabet‚Äôs securities lawyers decided it was time to warn investors of the risks of smart machines. Google declined to elaborate on its public filings. The company began testing self-driving cars on public roads in 2009 and has been publishing research on ethical questions raised by AI for several years.
Alphabet likes to position itself as a leader in AI research, but it was six months behind rival Microsoft in warning investors about the technology‚Äôs ethical risks. The AI disclosure in Google‚Äôs latest filing reads like a trimmed down version of much fuller language Microsoft put in its most recent annual SEC report, filed last August : ‚Äú AI algorithms may be flawed. Datasets may be insufficient or contain biased information. Inappropriate or controversial data practices by Microsoft or others could impair the acceptance of AI solutions. These deficiencies could undermine the decisions, predictions, or analysis AI applications produce, subjecting us to competitive harm, legal liability, and brand or reputational harm.
‚Äù Microsoft also has been investing deeply in AI for many years, and in 2016 it introduced an internal AI ethics board that has blocked some contracts seen as risking inappropriate use of the technology.

Both Microsoft and Alphabet have played prominent roles in a recent flowering of concern and research about ethical challenges raised by artificial intelligence. Both have already experienced them firsthand.
Last year, researchers found Microsoft‚Äôs cloud service was much less accurate at detecting the gender of black women than white men in photos. The company apologized and said it has fixed the problem. Employee protests at Google forced the company out of a Pentagon contract applying AI to drone surveillance footage, and it has censored its own Photos service from searching for apes in user snaps after an incident in which black people were mistaken for gorillas.
Microsoft‚Äôs and Google‚Äôs new disclosures might seem obscure. SEC filings are sprawling documents written in a special and copiously sub-claused lawyerly dialect. All the same, David Larcker, director of Stanford‚Äôs Corporate Governance Research Initiative, says the new acknowledgements of AI‚Äôs attendant risks have probably been noticed. ‚ÄúPeople do look at these things,‚Äù he says.
Investors and competitors analyze risk factors to get a sense of what‚Äôs on management‚Äôs mind, Larcker says. Many items are so commonly listed‚Äîsuch as the risks of an economic slowdown‚Äîas to be more or less meaningless. Differences among companies or unusual items, like ethical challenges raised by artificial intelligence, can be more informative.
Some companies that claim their futures depend heavily on AI and machine learning do not list unintended effects of those technologies in their SEC disclosures. In IBM‚Äôs most recent annual report, for 2017, the company claims that it ‚Äúleads the burgeoning market for artificial intelligence infused software solutions‚Äù while also being a pioneer of ‚Äúdata responsibility, ethics and transparency.‚Äù But the filing was silent on risks attendant with AI or machine learning. IBM did not respond to a request for comment. The company‚Äôs next annual filing is due in the next few weeks.
Amazon, which relies on AI in areas including its voice assistant Alexa and warehouse robots, did add a mention of artificial intelligence in the risk factors in its annual report filed earlier this month. However, unlike Google and Microsoft, the company does not invite investors to entertain thoughts of how its algorithms could be biased or unethical. Amazon‚Äôs fear is that the government will slap business-unfriendly rules on the technology.

Amazon didn‚Äôt respond to a request for comment about why it thinks investors need to know about regulatory but not ethical uncertainties around AI. That assessment may change in time.
Larcker says that as new business practices and technologies become more important, they tend to sprout in risk disclosures at many companies. Cybersecurity used to make a rare appearance in SEC filings; now mentioning it is pro forma. AI could be next. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs kind of the natural progression of things,‚Äù Larcker says.
