The numbers tell the story. In 2020, ecommerce will account for over $700 billion in sales across the U.S.
, a boost of nearly 20 percent over last year. At the heart of that $700 is Amazon , accounting for a full 38 percent, approximately $270 billion. And since half of Amazon’s sales this year will actually come from its third-party selling partners, that’s $135 billion coming in this year from Fulfilled by Amazon (FBA) businesses.
So if you’re asking whether it pays to open a business in the Amazon FBA space… well, the figures tell the tale.
Of course, it takes some know-how to get your piece of those billions upon billions of dollars.
With the training in The Complete Amazon Dropshipping and Private Label Master Class Bundle , even first-time retailers can learn all the steps to open a digital storefront under the Amazon umbrella — and start making it rain.
The collection is comprehensive, featuring 11 courses covering nearly 100 hours of training in everything it takes to begin life as an Amazon FBA business, how to find products that will connect with customers, and ultimately grow that business into a serious moneymaker.
The training begins with the Amazon FBA 2021 Course , a solid blueprint for getting any business off the ground. Led by veteran entrepreneur Thomas O’Donoghue, this course not only covers basics like supplier searches, inventory ordering, marketing and promotion, packaging, and more, it uncovers the missteps that handcuff 99 percent of Amazon FBA sellers and stymie their growth.
From that base, the other courses guide sellers through the rest of the Amazon FBA ecosystem, examining how to run PPC ad campaigns that actually work, the keys to finding a successful product to sell, and how to avoid committing the cardinal sins that could warrant a crippling account suspension.
If you want to get started, but don’t have a business in mind, there’s even the Amazon FBA Book Reseller Pro training. You can jump in immediately as an Amazon Marketplace dealer in second-hand books, finding cheap books to resell for high prices as this course explains each step in the business-building process.
Finally, a trio of courses also dig into one of the prestige corners of Amazon retailing — starting your own private label brand. In Amazon FBA Tycoon: The Ultimate Private Label Masterclass and The Last Amazon FBA Course: 2021 Private Label Guide , learners find it isn’t so hard to discover, source, and sell a product with your label, then guide it to 6, or even 7-figure sales.
Right now, all the training in The 2021 Complete Amazon Dropshipping and Private Label Master Class Bundle is on sale at hundreds off its regular price, just $34.99.
