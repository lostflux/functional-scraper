A year ago, then White House CTO Chopra wrote a guest post for VentureBeat about the government health insurance exchange, which at the time was mired in technical glitches and was considered a big black eye for the Obama Administration’s health reform program. Chopra says a lot has happened since then, and that the exchange has gone on to a new, and better, phase.
Above: Former (and first) White House CTO Aneesh Chopra Chopra also discusses new digital health approaches to personalizing health care for consumers, and new federal initiatives that will pay health providers to begin sharing health care data with each other.
