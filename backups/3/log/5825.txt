April Fools‚Äô Day is upon us, and while companies like Microsoft have told their employees not to participate, Google is as always trying to outdo itself. The company releases all sorts of jokes, ranging from the ridiculously lame to the very clever, from a simple blog post or video to an elaborate gag or new feature. It‚Äôs a very Google-specific tradition ‚Äî even other Alphabet companies don‚Äôt really participate in the celebration.
Google‚Äôs various divisions create more practical and impractical jokes for the holiday than any other tech firm (although the overall number seems to be decreasing), and it‚Äôs simply hard to keep track of them all. As such, we have put together our annual roundup ‚Äî here are all of Google‚Äôs April Fools jokes for 2019. (If you‚Äôre curious how it compares to previous years, see our roundups for 2018 , 2017 , 2016 , and 2015.
) Snake in Google Maps The Google Maps team tends to have more intricate jokes ‚Äî usually playable games ‚Äî and this year it‚Äôs a spinoff of the classic Snake.
 You can play Snake in Google Maps in different locations across the world, including Cairo, London, San Francisco, S√£o Paulo, Sydney, and Tokyo. To play, open the Google Maps app for Android or iOS, tap on the menu icon on the top left corner, and hit ‚ÄúPlay Snake.‚Äù Pick a city, grab as many passengers as you can, and make sure not to hit anything. Snake on Google Maps will be live in the app for about a week, and it even has a standalone site that Google says will stay up ‚Äúlong after April Foolsss is over.‚Äù Event GamesBeat at the Game Awards We invite you to join us in LA for GamesBeat at the Game Awards event this December 7.

This year, the team has added to the Gboard keyboard app with a new device that provides a more comfortable character input environment. The Gboard spoon bending version is all about flexibility: You input characters by bending a spoon. All you have to do is connect the Gboard spoon bending version to your smartphone or computer, bend the spoon, and the corresponding letter to that angle is entered. The less you bend, the closer you are to the beginning to the alphabet, and the more you bend, the closer you are to the end. Even more intriguing, if you bend the spoon with your mind, you‚Äôll enter more characters. The team has released designs, schematics, firmware, and so on, so you can even use a home 3D printer to build your home.
Google Tulip Your Google Home can now talk to tulips (‚ÄúHey Google, talk to my tulip.‚Äù), thanks to ‚Äúgreat advancements in artificial intelligence.‚Äù Translation between Tulipish and dozens of human languages means you can finally talk to tulips ‚Äî they‚Äôll tell you when they need water, light, or more space. Apparently, tulips are not only very chatty, they‚Äôre also great listeners and offer ‚Äúsound advice.‚Äù Google Tulip was largely developed in the Netherlands, a country that produces 12.5 billion flowers a year, and tested in the world-famous flower park Keukenhof. As for the AI part, Google and the Wageningen University & Research team built on Neural Machine Translation to map tulip signals to human language. It took two years of training to add Tulipish as a language to Google Home‚Äôs recently introduced Interpreter Mode.
Screen Cleaner in the Files app The Files by Google app for Android is no longer just an app. Instead of merely cleaning your device on the inside, the app now offers a ‚ÄúScreen cleaner‚Äù feature that can ‚Äúwash away smudges and polish your screen.‚Äù It uses the Smudge Detector API to identify imperfections using geometric dirt models and a haptic micromovement generator to dislodge dirt, smudges, and more. In fact, once your device is clean, the feature uses internal vibrations and haptic controls to form a ‚Äúlong-lasting, non-stick shield‚Äù using a thin magnetic field, complete with a pineapple scent.
Google Fi now works in the Atlantic Ocean No, not just on the Atlantic Ocean. Google Fi now works at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. Who is Google to judge where you need cellular service? You‚Äôll feel a ~wave~ of emotions about this news‚Äîyou‚Äôre now covered on Fi at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. üåä pic.twitter.com/da34B5LDEh ‚Äî Google Fi (@googlefi) April 1, 2019 Google Colab Power Mode Google Colab introduced a Power Mode that lets you ‚Äúrack up combos and see sparks fly.‚Äù Power Mode causes sparks to fly out from the cursor when you are typing and shows an animated ‚Äúcombo counter.‚Äù This is one of the lamer gags this year.
Power Mode is now live in Colab ‚Äì rack up combos and see sparks fly. Happy April 1st! pic.twitter.com/rh9oqSc1hi ‚Äî Colaboratory (@GoogleColab) April 1, 2019 Google Assistant In previous years, if you asked Google Assistant about April Fools‚Äô on the day, it would respond with something along the lines of ‚ÄúWe can get through April Fools‚Äô together. Here‚Äôs one thing to remember. If something seems too good to be true today, it probably is.‚Äù This year, it just spits out historical pranks like this one: Just say ‚ÄúApril Fools'‚Äù to Google Assistant and it will keep spitting out other examples.
Waymo Pet The Alphabet rule is broken every once in a while by Waymo. Why do humans get to have all the self-driving car fun? Pets have places to go, too, and they don‚Äôt want to deal with the hassle of driving either. Waymo has redesigned the driving experience for pets, including a custom laser show for cats, a cooling system for hamsters, and so on.
When it comes to April Fools‚Äô Day, Google seems to have a bottomless pit for a marketing budget. Will 2019 be the same as previous years? We will update this post as the company launches more jokes.
