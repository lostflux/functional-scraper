RadiumOne runs an automated platform for online and mobile ads.
Chahal was fired from RadiumOne last year after refusing to resign amid allegations he had beaten his girlfriend.
In a blog post last year, Chahal said he pled guilty to two misdemeanors because he didn’t want to endure a lengthy trial.
“While I had full intentions of getting fully exonerated of these charges, that would require me to go through trial and waste another one year of my life,” he said.
He’s since started a new ad tech venture called Gravity4.
 He’s also reportedly made moves to buy his old company back.
In a regularly scheduled court appearance, city prosecutors said Chahal had completed 43 classes — ostensibly related to domestic violence — and was compliant with his sentencing.
“This is a very good report, Mr. Chahal,” said Judge Tracie Brown.
Chahal was ordered to reappear in court on April 3.
