She is excited about methods to turn data into actionable knowledge. Her core research in machine learning, computational statistics, and data science is inspired by—and often applied to—the objective of accelerating scientific progress and practical impact in healthcare and other domains.
Specifically, she is interested in questions such as: How can we design robust, principled models to combine complex data sets with other knowledge sources? How can we design models that summarise and generate hypotheses from such data? How can we characterise the uncertainty in large, heterogeneous data to provide better support for decisions? Finale is interested in developing the probabilistic methods to address these questions.
Prior to joining SEAS, Finale was an NSF CI-TRaCS Postdoctoral Fellow at the Center for Biomedical Informatics at Harvard Medical School. She was a Marshall Scholar at Trinity College, Cambridge from 2007-2009, and she was named one of IEEE’s “AI Top 10 to Watch” in 2013.
