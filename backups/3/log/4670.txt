Sony is coming with a big lineup of games for its PlayStation Plus subscribers next month.
If you’re a member of Sony’s premium PlayStation Plus service in June and own a PlayStation 4, you’ll get access to an amazing basketball game and one of the most beloved independent games of the last few years. Like always, all three PlayStation platforms — PS4, PS3, and PS Vita — are getting two games each as part of PS Plus’s “instant library” feature. Here’s the fulle lineup: NBA 2K16 (PS4) Gone Home: Console Edition (PS4) Echochrome (PS3) Siren: Blood Curse – Episodes 1-12 (PS3) God of War: Chains of Olympus (PS Vita) Little Deviants (PS Vita) Let’s look a bit closer at each game.
