What’s the greatest shortcoming of online education today? It’s boring. Really boring.
That’s the problem NovoEd raised $2 million to solve.
NovoEd , the fourth massive open online course (MOOC) platform to launch out of Stanford — following edX, Udacity, and Coursera — aims to make online education stickier. While most MOOC platforms attempt to recreate the lecture hall, NovoEd wants to facilitate collaborative, group-driven education for universities.
NovoEd’s goal, of course, is to reverse the huge dropout rate online courses often face.
Following a April 2013 debut , NovoEd claims it’s already “ improving college graduation rates by tackling remedial math” and “increasing online course retention rates by more than 10x.” As we wrote last year, “the company started out as Venture Lab, a project run by a Stanford professor and a PhD student to make online learning more social, experiential, and interactive.” The site has so far partnered with UC Berkley , Princeton, and numerous other educational organizations.
To date, NovoEd has raised over $2.04 million, according to a public SEC filing.
 The round first kicked off over two months ago and has yet to close.
