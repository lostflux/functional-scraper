The first home devices that will be controlled by Apple’s HomeKit connected home platform will start arriving next week.
So says a new report from 9to5Mac today, citing sources briefed on the matter.
HomeKit is a framework in iOS 8 for communicating with and controlling connected accessories in a user’s home. The cloud platform will let users discover HomeKit devices in their home and configure them, according to Apple. Users can also group actions together and trigger them using Siri.
We already knew that the HomeKit-certified devices would start arriving in June, because Apple said so in a statement in mid-May.
“HomeKit has been available for just a few months and we already have dozens of partners who have committed to bringing HomeKit accessories to market and we’re looking forward to the first ones coming next month,” a spokesperson said in a statement.
Apple pointed out at the time that HomeKit is enabled in iOS 8 and that chip and accessory makers have already been making announcements about being certified. The first wave of HomeKit-certified products and apps will begin hitting the market shortly, Apple told VentureBeat.
Broadcom recently announced that its new WICED Internet of Things platform would be closely integrated with HomeKit.
The news today comes one day after Google announced its new Internet of Things operating system, Brillo, and a new common language for connected devices called Weave.
