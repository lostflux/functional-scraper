Insight Venture Partners led a $30 million investment for SmartRecruiters , the hiring startup announced today.
SmartRecruiters said the capital will be used to further develop its product and global reach.
“Unlike other newer recruiting vendors or legacy applicant tracking system providers, only SmartRecruiters’ enterprise talent acquisition platform delivers both the user experience that today’s candidates and hiring managers demand and the level of customization, flexibility and scale that enterprises demand,” the startup explained.
The Mayfield Fund , an early Lyft funder, also participated in the series C round for SmartRecruiters.
SmartRecruiters has raised at least $55 million to date.
