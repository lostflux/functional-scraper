PlayStation 3 hit The Last of Us recently got remastered for the PlayStation 4. We’ve already seen games like Tomb Raider get a similar treatment, and we know that Grand Theft Auto V is also getting released on the Xbox One and PlayStation 4.
So what other PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Wii classics (too soon to call them classics?) deserve the same treatment? Let us know by writing for GamesBeat Unfiltered , our community-focused site where all of our readers can publish their own work! Pick a game, and make your case. Maybe the Uncharted trilogy needs a spiffy collection for the PlayStation 4, or maybe an under-looked gem like Alan Wake could get the recognition it deserves with a new-gen re-release.
Let us know what you think! Just head over to our “ about ” page. It’ll tell you how to make your own account and submit stories to GamesBeat Unfiltered.
