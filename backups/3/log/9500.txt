Hal, the thinking computer Photograph: Ronald Grant Raising HAL Science Raising HAL: introducing our new AI and data blog Raising HAL is a new blog by science writer Martin Robbins, with a focus on artificial intelligence, and the data and algorithms that make up the fabric of our new online reality Thu 25 Feb 2016 06.34 EST There’s an old book on my shelf, and nearly eight years ago I wrote my first ever blog post about it. It’s called March of the Machines, and the back jacket confidently predicts that, “within 5 years robots will exist with the brain power of cats,” and, “in 10-50 years robots will exist that are more intelligent than humans.” The book was published in 1997, and nineteen years later the claims of “Britain’s leading prophet of the Robot Age,” seem oddly relevant. This was before Google or Facebook with their vast server fields and billion-dollar AI teams, before the rise of deep learning and the fall of Moore’s Law, before the Internet was anything like the economic and cultural force it is today. A digital eternity has passed – almost six hundred billion ticks of the UNIX clock – and yet here we still are; the same prophets predicting the same milestones in the same timeframes.
I started my old blog, The Lay Scientist, in a golden age of scepticism that’s not so much fizzled out as been assimilated into wider media. In 2010 when I moved it to the Guardian to help launch the Science blog network , writers like Ben Goldacre were still an anomaly. A few years later a small horde of smart sassy debunkers – not least my outstanding colleagues here – stand ready to shoot nonsense down at a moment’s notice.
It’s all a bit too fast for me. It’s still true that “a lie can travel halfway around the world while the truth is putting on its boots”, but even the truth is shuffling through Terminal 5 before I’ve stopped punching my alarm clock. I was never that interested in repeating what everyone else is doing, and frankly I’m not needed anymore, so it’s time to refocus.
Rutger Hauer as the all-too-mortal Batty in Blade Runner Where better to go than back to the start? There is a vast and growing gap between the increasingly data- and algorithm-driven environment we live in and the ability of most science and tech writers to keep up with it. The result is low quality coverage of artificial intelligence, characterised by PR hype, tech hysteria, moral panic and the vacant regurgitation of buzzwords.
The job of journalists is to speak truth to power. Power is increasingly tied to data, and the forces – human or artificial – that control, analyse, manipulate and present it on our behalf. We also need to explain, and frankly there hasn’t been enough explanation - what actually is deep learning? How does a neural net really work? How are these algorithms used in the real world, how good are they and what are the real dangers? So my blog here is re-launching as Raising HAL, and I’ll do my best to shed a little bit of light on all of the above. I won’t always be right, but I’ll try to at least ask the right questions. And I definitely won’t create a sentient machine that enslaves your entire family to clean its solar panels, so there’s that.
