This approach allows both entities to maintain their unique strengths while benefiting from the collective expertise.
Global impact: With a global team of 160, SplitMetrics currently manages over $250 million in annual ad spend, catering to clients such as Babbel, Skyscanner, Glovo, and Rakuten Viber. App Radar specializes in app store optimization and automation for 30,000 app developers and marketers globally.
