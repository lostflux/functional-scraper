Now, having amassed a database of nearly all human protein structures, the company is making the resource available online free for researchers to use.
The key to understanding our basic biological machinery is its architecture. The chains of amino acids that comprise proteins twist and turn to make the most confounding of 3D shapes. It is this elaborate form that explains protein function; from enzymes that are crucial to metabolism to antibodies that fight infectious attacks.
Despite years of onerous and expensive lab work that began in the 1950s, scientists have only decoded the structure of a fraction of human proteins. DeepMind’s AI program, AlphaFold, has predicted the structure of nearly all 20,000 proteins expressed by humans.
 In an independent benchmark test that compared predictions to known structures, the system was able to predict the shape of a protein to a good standard 95% of time.
DeepMind, which has partnered with the European Molecular Biology Laboratory’s European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI), hopes the database will help researchers to analyse how life works at an atomic scale by unpacking the apparatus that drives some diseases, make strides in the field of personalised medicine, create more nutritious crops and develop “green enzymes” that can break down plastic.
Q&A What is AI? Show Artificial Intelligence has various definitions, but in general it means a program that uses data to build a model of some aspect of the world. This model is then used to make informed decisions and predictions about future events. The technology is used widely, to provide speech and face recognition, language translation, and personal recommendations on music, film and shopping sites. In the future, it could deliver driverless cars, smart personal assistants, and intelligent energy grids. AI has the potential to make organisations more effective and efficient, but the technology raises serious issues of ethics, governance, privacy and law.
Collaboration in recent months with scientists working on a range of projects – from diseases that disproportionately affect poorer parts of the world to studying antibiotic resistance or the biology of the virus that causes Covid – has already begun.
“The applications are actually limited only by our imagination – but at a more fundamental level, the AlphaFold database will increase our understanding of how proteins function, and their role in the fundamental processes of life,” said Prof Edith Heard, the director-general of the EMBL.
“This understanding means we can be better equipped to unravel the molecular mechanisms of life and accelerate our pursuits to protect and treat human health, as well as the health of our planet, and making this tool open access will accelerate the power of research discovery and innovation for scientists around the world.” AlphaFold’s ability to predict protein structure with dizzying accuracy was unveiled at the biennial “protein olympics” last year. Participants were given the amino acid sequences for about 100 proteins and challenged to work them out. AlphaFold not only eclipsed the performance of other computer programs but achieved accuracy analogous to laborious lab-based methods.
“I almost fell off my chair in just excitement and amazement that this longstanding problem of how proteins fold had been solved,” said Prof Ewan Birney, the director of the EMBL-EBI, after the results were first presented in November.
“This dataset is rather like the human genome … and it’s this dataset where we start some new bits of science that we weren’t able to do beforehand. I’m very excited to start walking down that road.” Explore more on these topics DeepMind Artificial intelligence (AI) Medical research Microbiology Biology news More on this story More on this story Demis Hassabis: the deep mind Dominic Cummings turned to as the pandemic hit 27 May 2021 DeepMind AI cracks 50-year-old problem of protein folding 30 Nov 2020 Google’s DeepMind makes AI program that can learn like a human 14 Mar 2017 … … Google's DeepMind plans bitcoin-style health record tracking for hospitals 9 Mar 2017 AI can win at poker: but as computers get smarter, who keeps tabs on their ethics? 5 Feb 2017 … … Whatever happened to the DeepMind AI ethics board Google promised? 26 Jan 2017 The Guardian view on AI in the NHS: not the revolution you are looking for 6 Jan 2017 … … No one can read what’s on the cards for artificial intelligence 29 Jan 2017 … … Labour calls for closer scrutiny of tech firms and their algorithms 18 Dec 2016 … … Most viewed Most viewed US World Environment US Politics Ukraine Soccer Business Tech Science Newsletters Wellness News Opinion Sport Culture Lifestyle About us Help Complaints & corrections SecureDrop Work for us Privacy policy Cookie policy Terms & conditions Contact us All topics All writers Digital newspaper archive Facebook YouTube Instagram LinkedIn Twitter Newsletters Advertise with us Guardian Labs Search jobs Back to top
