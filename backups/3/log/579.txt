Cohere Website For Business Docs Research Lewis Stott Introducing Cohere's Accelerator Program For Business Share: At Cohere, we aim to offer the best level of support in our industry across every tier of our users â€” from developers, to startups, to our enterprise-level deployments. As a startup ourselves, we know first-hand how challenging it can be for a small team with limited resources to get MVPs to market quickly and drive growth. So, this month, we launched the Cohere Accelerator Program , which provides enhanced assistance to ambitious startups looking to put language AI at the heart of what they do.
Giving technology language is core to our mission, so we ensure that even those without machine learning expertise can easily enhance their mobile app, backend service, or platform by adding language AI features using an intuitive API. Through our partnership with Google, Cohere leverages Google Cloudâ€™s TPUs to give customers access to massive supercomputing power at a fraction of the cost. This can be a game-changer for startups who donâ€™t have the resources to build, train, and maintain LLMs on their own. Cohere makes it easy for teams to quickly build products that include language AI features, such as copywriting, search, conversational AI, summarization, or content moderation, to name a few.
If you want to enhance your teamâ€™s productivity or create better customer experiences with large language models, our program can help fast-track your growth, development, and success.
What is the Cohere Accelerator Program? Cohereâ€™s rapidly expanding customer base includes a broad range of users and businesses, from individual developers to some of our largest enterprise customers, such as Spotify and Jasper. The business worldâ€™s appetite and excitement for language AI has truly never been greater, yet we frequently see smaller businesses and startups grappling with how best to approach and adopt natural language processing (NLP) within their organizations. Recognizing this need, we designed the Cohere Accelerator Program to give these teams a head start.
One of the most common feedback themes we receive from enterprise customers is that our in-house experts help them to move further, faster. Weâ€™ve seen this experience benefit some of our startup customers as well. Once such customer that recently closed their Series B highlights how the Cohere team has supported their growth: With a focus on 1:1 support, collaboration, and beta access to our latest offerings, the Accelerator Program will help startups rapidly drive production-ready deployments.
