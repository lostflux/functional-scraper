 Please also consider subscribing to WIRED Picturesque Platformer $20 at PlayStation Store Intrepid Ensemble $60 at PlayStation Store Deck Crafter $25 at PlayStation Store Rural Trappings $20 at PlayStation Store It’s close to the third anniversary of Sony’s PlayStation 5 release. (That was a wild moment in time !) Whether you’re one of the 40 million people who’ve already snatched a PS5 or you’re still holding onto that dusty PS4, PlayStation Plus is a worthwhile video game subscription service.
 While longtime PlayStation devotees may have to really dig through the catalog to uncover a delightful surprise, new adoptees will revel in the available choices.
The three tiers of PS Plus are Essential, Extra, and Premium.
Essential is the cheapest option; for $10 a month you gain access to online multiplayer and can download a couple of curated titles each month. The Extra tier is similar to Xbox Game Pass , and it’s the main focus of this roundup. You receive access to over 100 games for $15 a month with this option. Another $3 elevates you to the Premium tier, which mainly adds streaming access to classic PlayStation games.
For a deeper diver into this subscription service, check out our PS Plus explainer.
 Searching for even more PlayStation picks? We got you covered with this list of top-tier PS5 games.

Picturesque Platformer Celeste While it’s been five years since its initial release, Celeste is a retro-inspired platformer that’s worth revisiting. The ethereal music sets the perfect tone as you dash your way through level after level. Even though the art is cute, be ready to focus up as you attempt to beat the more challenging aspects. Fans of visual novels will enjoy the narrative elements as well.
