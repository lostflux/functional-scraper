[laughing] This probably gets typed in the most.

Is Nick Offerman anything like Ron Swanson? Uh, sure.
He looks and sounds an awful lot like him.
Loves meat.
Loves making things with wood.
Loves scotch, particularly Lagavulin single malt and he really gets randy for women that look like Megan Mullally.
Is Nick Offerman show appropriate for kids? Yeah.
If you're talking about my touring show which I think is what they're asking.
If your kids are conservative, they might get their feelings a little bit hurt.
When I intimate that they're indecent.

I was a carpenter, then I became a scenery carpenter, then I became a woodworker.

He plays several.
Does Nick Offerman have tattoos? He does, two.
One on each python.
One is a heart viney thing with a rose.
The rose looks kind of like lady parts.
It's called a Georgia O'Keefe rose and it has a banner that says mater, Latin for mother.
It's my pretentious mother tattoo.
The other one are these sort of Mississippi Indian band, wrap around with an ankh right here and that tattoo says I'm a very big fan of the Red Hot Chili Peppers right after Blood Sugar Sex Magick came out.
I stand by it.

Two sisters and a brother.
All magnificent creatures.

How to meet Nick Offerman.
Politely.
How did Nick Offerman meet Megan Mullally? We met doing a play in Los Angeles called the Berlin Circle by Chuck Mee.
Thank my lucky stars.
Chuck Mee is a cool absurdist writer.
He calls himself a collage writer and has characters like Eric Honaker and Megan played New York socialite Pamela Harriman and it ended with the celebratory, everybody gets together and sings the Beatles' All You Need Is Love in German, [speaking in German] I believe and the rest is history.

My inner beast, Tim Curry as Frank Furter in Rocky Horror Picture Show.
Frank N. Furter.
Nick Offerman, Lord of the Rings.
Nick Offerman, quotes to live by.
Stick around, they're coming up any moment now.
Nick Offerman, shirts on making it.

Check 'em out, their stuff is dope.
Nick Offerman yule log.
A brilliant idea by a young man named David Philips.
I shoot commercials for Lagavulin Scotch.
One of them for Christmas is me sitting by a roaring fireplace meant to be put on the television to a company, your office party, your family gathering, as I sip scotch in a satisfying manner.
You're welcome.
Nick Offerman quotes about love.
Love is where it's at.
It all turns on affection.
I feel pretty, like that was pretty nice and harmless and I'm surprised frankly, you know, that there weren't any like why don't we put Nick Offerman in prison.
