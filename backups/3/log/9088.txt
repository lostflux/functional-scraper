Lee Sedol, who is the world’s second best player of the strategy game, lost three games in a row in Seoul this week, with the latest AlphaGo victory on Saturday handing Google the best-of-five match.
“I’ve never played a game where I felt this amount of pressure, and I wasn’t able to overcome this pressure,” Lee said at a post-game press conference.
Go has simple rules, but is highly intuitive and complex in practice. Mastering it has been an exceptionally difficult task for even the world’s best IT designers.
“We came here to challenge Lee, to learn from him and see what AG was capable of,” said Demis Hassabis, co-founder of Google’s artificial intelligence business, DeepMind , which created the program.
“AlphaGo controlled the momentum over more than four hours of gameplay, with Lee struggling to maintain territory against the program’s creative approach. Google DeepMind taught AlphaGo to recognise the optimal move in thousands of possible scenarios.” AlphaGo’s dominance amounts to a significant, and much faster than previously expected, advance in artificial intelligence.
Google co-founder Sergey Brin, who was in Seoul to watch the third match, described Go as a beautiful game and said he was excited the company had been able to “instil that kind of beauty in our computers”.
Michael Redmond, one of the match’s commentators and a professional Go player, said some people initially doubted AlphaGo’s abilities. “After three matches and three straight victories, we are convinced,” he said.
AlphaGo won $1m in prize money, which Google DeepMind said would be donated to charities, including Unicef and Go organisations.
“AlphaGo controlled the game amazingly,” said Fan Hui, the European Go champion who was the first professional player to lose to the program when he played it in October.
Hui said the advances in artificial intelligence appeared to bode well for the future of the ancient game.
“We now have this new way of learning about Go. And look how many people are watching this now. More and more people are interested in Go now.” Explore more on these topics Artificial intelligence (AI) Board games South Korea Google Alphabet Asia Pacific Computing news More on this story More on this story China censored Google's AlphaGo match against world's best Go player 24 May 2017 World's best Go player flummoxed by Google’s ‘godlike’ AlphaGo AI 23 May 2017 Google's AlphaGo wins second game against Go champion 10 Mar 2016 … … Google's AlphaGo AI defeats human in first game of Go contest 9 Mar 2016 … … Way to Go: how Google’s computer beat the Chinese game’s world champion 9 Mar 2016 … … AlphaGo computer beats Go champion – video 9 Mar 2016 The Guardian view on robots and humanity: passing Go 9 Mar 2016 … … Google's AI machine v world champion of 'Go': everything you need to know 8 Mar 2016 … … Most viewed Most viewed US World Environment US Politics Ukraine Soccer Business Tech Science Newsletters Wellness News Opinion Sport Culture Lifestyle About us Help Complaints & corrections SecureDrop Work for us Privacy policy Cookie policy Terms & conditions Contact us All topics All writers Digital newspaper archive Facebook YouTube Instagram LinkedIn Twitter Newsletters Advertise with us Guardian Labs Search jobs Back to top
