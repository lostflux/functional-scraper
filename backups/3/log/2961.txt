You know what I mean? 100 and I do know that.
[board thumps] Okay, let's see here.
Is Ice Cube a Raider fan? Come on, man, you know the answer to that.
I'm the president of the Raider Nation.
Tom Brady, you're a rookie.
We need donuts in the locker room, bro.
Is Ice Cube coming out with another Friday? Hopefully, but you never know, you know? It's not in my hands.
If it was in my hands, we'd be on the 20th version.
It'd be like Fast and Furious.
Is Ice Cube East or West Coast? West Coast, baby.
I am the West Coast Warlord.

What is Ice Cube's good day? Man, it's a good day when I'm kicking it and nothing bad happened to my family, my friends, or anybody I know, that is a good day.
Yeah, it's a little different now.
You know I'm a married man, you know what I'm saying? I can't be doing the things I did in that song, man.

Does Ice Cube like Korn? You talking about the band? Of course I like Korn.
Come on, man, you know one of the best bands to come out of LA, baby, Korn.
My partner Jeff Kwatinetz used to manage Korn.
We ran into each other and it was just a good vibe.
We did music together, went on the Family Values Tour with them, friends to this day.
Does Ice Cube live in Anaconda? How can I live in Anaconda? Oh, did I live in the movie Anaconda? I was like, man, how can I live in the anaconda? Yes, Ice Cube did live in Anaconda.
Since I'm the black guy you probably thought I'll die early in the movie like in Jurassic Park.
Thank you, Steven Spielberg.
Does Ice Cube own his Masters? Yes, I do. [board clunks] [sighs] How old was Ice Cube in Boyz in the Hood? 19.
When did Ice Cube get famous? My breakout hit was a song that I did called Dope Man, Dope Man.
Produced by Dr. Dre, put out on Rufus Records.
We dropped it in '87.
Ice Cube's, Ninja Turtles.
What about my Ninja Turtles? I'm playing Superfly, the baddest villain since Darth Vader.
The baddest villain since Jaws.
Don't get on his bad side, he'll shit on you.
How did Ice Cube and Dr. Dre meet? I met Dr. Dre because his cousin lived right down the street from me.
I was always waiting for him to come over.
He came over, I rapped for him, the rest is history.
[board clunks] Ice Cube, that's me, Bow Down lyrics.
♪ The world is mine homie get back ♪ ♪ Don't mess with my stack the gage is racked ♪ ♪ About to drop the bomb I'm they motherfuckin' don ♪ ♪ Big fish in a small pond ♪ You know the rest.
Ice Cube, first song? Is it the first hit song or just the first song I ever wrote? 'cause the first song I ever wrote was kind of, it was boo boo, it was a few years of rapping.
I started rapping when I was 14.
I wrote a song for The Wrecking Crew when I was 15.
It was a song called The Cabbage Patch Dance.
It was, you know, my first song written, very proud of it.
And then I wrote Boyz-n-the-Hood when I was 16.
Ice Cube's yay, yay.
George Clinton, I actually got it off of a Knee Deep record.
He'd say, ♪ A beat yeah yeah ♪ ♪ Not just knee deep ♪ ♪ As long as the knee deep when she did the freak with me ♪ That's where the Yay Yay comes from, George Clinton.
Ice Cube's eyebrow.
It is I, it is mine.
