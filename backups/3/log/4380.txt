Trion Worlds is tired of waiting for your turn.
The developer announced today Atlas Reactor, a multiplayer tactics game for PC with a futuristic setting. While most tactics games have players take turns, Atlas Reactor has both sides simultaneously taking their actions. This means that you have to guess what your opponent is going to do as well as worry about your own turn. The competitive gaming market is becoming huge thanks to the booming esports scene.
 Thanks to hits like League of Legends and Dota 2, it’s a $621 million business, according to intelligence firm SuperData Research.
Trion Worlds is known for other online PC games, including the massively multiplayer online role-playing games Rift and the Defiance shooter (which has a TV show on SyFy).
You can sign up for the game’s Alpha test here.
