With the explosion of data processing needs for increasingly sophisticated AI, real-time streaming and analytics, the environmental implications of power-hungry data centers have come into sharp focus.
IT and data leaders are now making efforts to curb energy consumption and reduce their environmental footprint in line with organizational sustainability goals. It’s also smart: it can save costs and thus improve the bottom line as well.
— Aliyah Mohammed Associate Managing Editor 5 Ways to Rein in Data Center Consumption in 2024 Sharon Goldman IT and data leaders have known for years that data centers are power-hungry and energy-intensive, but demand for data centers has also skyrocketed thanks to the growth of remote work and high-speed streaming, as well as the explosion of generative AI models and tools. As a result, U.S. data center demand is forecast to grow by 10% per year until 2030.
Addressing data center consumption is crucial experts say. This is because of environmental impacts like carbon emissions associated with data centers (which doubled between 2017 and 2020) and resource depletion, as well as the need to boost cost efficiency, comply with regulations, tackle corporate responsibility and improve disaster resilience.
