Game two left him speechless, and in game three he felt powerless.
Sedol came back to win in game four but the final game ended with Google's AlphaGo defeating the Go master again.
A computer had beaten the best Go player in the world, four to one.
The weight of this defeat stirred a certain sadness in many people around the world because unlike chess, Go is a complex game that requires human intuition and creativity or so it was thought.
AlphaGo's system uses deep neuro-networks which approximate the web of neurons in the human brain.
These networks learn to perform tasks by analyzing large amounts of digital data.
The AlphaGo team took it a step farther.
Using reinforcement learning, they set up countless matches in which different versions of AlphaGo played each other.
So AlphaGo learns from human moves, and then it develops its own strategy.
It understands how humans play, but it can also look beyond that to play an entirely different level of the game.
This may seem frightening, but the reality is that the technologies at the heart of AlphaGo are the future.
They're poised to reinvent everything from robotics to scientific research.
In the years to come as we humans work with these machines our genius will only grow in tandem with our creations.
Well, hopefully.
So don't view it as human versus machine, but rather human and machine.
