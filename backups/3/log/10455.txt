But InSight’s greatest accomplishment may also be its last act; just two weeks later, scientists on the InSight team revealed that the lander’s solar panels are now blanketed with dust, which has gradually accumulated since its arrival on the planet. Those panels’ diminishing power will likely spell the end of the mission.
When the lander arrived on the Red Planet, the panels generated 5,000 watt-hours per sol (a Martian day), but now they’re down to about a tenth of that, said Kathya Zamora Garcia, InSight deputy project manager at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, at a virtual press conference on Tuesday. The scientists will keep running Insight’s seismometer and robotic arm camera full-time for a few more weeks, and will run them for half-days every other sol after that, but they expect InSight’s science operations to end this summer, possibly in July.
“We’re getting to the point where, we think in the next few months, we’ll probably have to shut down the instruments. Then maybe a few months after that, the spacecraft itself won’t have enough power to stay awake and communicate with Earth,” said Bruce Banerdt, InSight’s principal investigator at JPL, speaking the day before the press conference.
Since 2018 , InSight has resided near the Martian equator in a smooth impact crater named Elysium Planitia, probing the planet’s interior with a seismometer provided by a team of scientists at France’s National Centre for Space Studies. The sensitive instrument detects seismic waves as tiny motions in the ground, measuring how much the ground shakes. Last year it helped scientists measure the size and density of Mars’ core as well as the thickness of its crust. The lander collects weather data too.
Its most remarkable finding so far may have been its detection of the big quake earlier this month, which was nearly 10 times the strength of the previous record holder, a marsquake it measured last August. On Earth, the shifting, building, and colliding of tectonic plates causes earthquakes as well as volcanoes.
 Mars doesn’t have such an active tectonic system, although it may have had one, along with a molten core, billions of years ago. Nonetheless, scientists believe it still has some limited tectonic activity. Even though the planet’s crust isn’t flowing, it’s brittle and has fractures and weak points, because the planet is shrinking slightly as it gradually cools. Learning more about the crust and the goings-on below has been a major goal of the InSight mission.
Originally planned to last two years, InSight has nearly doubled that lifespan. The convertible-sized lander has stoically completed most of its mission while planted in its equatorial spot, surviving both swirling dust storms and clear Martian weather, and functioning during tectonic activity and quiet periods. InSight has already achieved all of its goals with the exception of sinking a heat probe into the ground, Banerdt says. That instrument, developed and built by the German Aerospace Center, was designed to take the Red Planet’s internal temperature and provide more information about its underground geology, but InSight couldn’t burrow the probe, also known as the “mole,” sufficiently deep into the clumpy Martian soil. (The Martian dirt also thwarted NASA’s Perseverance rover’s first attempt to collect a rock sample.)

While dust storms come by frequently—though not as intensely as portrayed in The Martian —they emerge more often during the summer, says Raymond Arvidson, a planetary scientist at Washington University in St. Louis and a member of the Mars Science Laboratory and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter teams. Over time, dust continually collected atop the flat, horizontal solar arrays, which started off near-black, but are now almost completely a dusty auburn. This has limited the lander’s power, and ultimately, its life expectancy.
In January, a particularly large, thick dust storm blocked sunlight from reaching the panels. Because of the reduced power supply, the InSight team put the lander in “safe mode,” suspending all but the essential functions needed for survival, until resuming normal operations about 12 days later. Since InSight is stuck in one place, it has almost no ability to shake off the dust by moving around. “With a rover, you might be able to tilt the panels, but with a lander, you are where you are,” says Amy Williams, a geologist at the University of Florida who works with the Curiosity and Perseverance rovers. (Both are powered by radioactive plutonium , while their predecessors, Spirit and Opportunity, were solar-powered.) While Martian storms can sprinkle dust on solar panels, they also come with winds that can sweep off dust, too, which benefited Spirit and Opportunity, Williams says: “They had enough dust devils nearby that actually cleaned the solar panels and allowed those missions to go a long time. InSight has not been so fortunate.” “Dust isn’t our friend,” Arvidson agrees. “Apparently, the location of InSight doesn’t have a lot of these dust devils or high winds to blow dust off; it just accumulates.” In May 2021, the InSight team successfully tried a new dust-removal technique, using the lander’s robotic arm to trickle some grains of sand onto a solar panel—when a gust of wind carried the sand away, it swept a little dust off with it. But the trick isn’t enough to save the lander this time; last year it only brought back a few tens of watt-hours of energy. The scientists now think there is only around a 5 percent chance of a lucky windstorm clearing enough dust to give the lander a new lease on life this summer, Banerdt says.

We can also think of seasons to send spacecraft—like in planning for the Mars sample return mission, we could send the lander during a season that’s less dusty,” said Lori Glaze, director of NASA’s Planetary Science Division at the agency’s Washington headquarters, during Tuesday’s press conference. Design of the seismometer for the Dragonfly spacecraft that will be sent to Saturn’s moon Titan could also be informed by InSight’s instrument.
While all space missions have limited lifespans, those who work on them for years, and fans who follow their development and findings, understandably grow attached to these spacefaring machines. After the lander shuts down later this year, it’s possible that if the wind blows just right, InSight could awaken and once again send signals back home. Banerdt and his colleagues will be listening, just in case. But in the meantime, they are mourning as they anticipate InSight’s likely end. “It’s really sad. This lander has done everything that we’ve asked of it and more. It really feels almost like part of the family,” Banerdt says. “I wake up every morning and see what messages it sent us, what data it sent us. I’m not sure what it’ll be like, when I wake up and there’s not anything in my email to tell me about what’s going on in Mars. It’s going to leave a little hole in my life.” You Might Also Like … 📨 Make the most of chatbots with our AI Unlocked newsletter Taylor Swift, Star Wars, Stranger Things , and Deadpool have one man in common Generative AI is playing a surprising role in Israel-Hamas disinformation The new era of social media looks as bad for privacy as the last one Johnny Cash’s Taylor Swift cover predicts the boring future of AI music Your internet browser does not belong to you 🔌 Charge right into summer with the best travel adapters , power banks , and USB hubs Staff Writer X Topics Mars NASA space planetary science Spacecraft seismology Astronomy Ramin Skibba Matt Simon Matt Simon Amit Katwala Grace Browne Ramin Skibba Jim Robbins Matt Simon Facebook X Pinterest YouTube Instagram Tiktok More From WIRED Subscribe Newsletters Mattresses Reviews FAQ Wired Staff Coupons Black Friday Editorial Standards Archive Contact Advertise Contact Us Customer Care Jobs Press Center RSS Accessibility Help Condé Nast Store Do Not Sell My Personal Info © 2023 Condé Nast.
