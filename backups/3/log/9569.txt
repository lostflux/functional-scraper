These days, Google has greater ambitions. This much was clear at Google I/O , the company's annual developer conference, which kicked off this morning at Google headquarters in Mountain View, California. Executives presented their vision for the future of the company‚Äîone where its services work everywhere, for everyone, and for everything.
Google is doing this in ways both big and small. It‚Äôs trying to make the Google Assistant work more seamlessly in your life‚Äîso that, for example, you can simply say ‚ÄúStop‚Äù to turn off the alarm on your smart speaker or ask it to do a few things without having to say ‚ÄúHey Google‚Äù between every request. It's helping automate some of the inane tasks of online life, like filling out web forms, with Google Duplex.
 It‚Äôs also drilling down on its mission to merge the digital world with the physical one. Want to understand the scale of that great white shark? Look it up on Google‚Äîthen bring the shark to life before your eyes in augmented reality.
All of this came together in a keynote speech with CEO Sundar Pichai and other Google executives. Missed the show? You can watch the whole thing here , read a play-by-play on WIRED‚Äôs liveblog , or read on for the TL;DR.
Google For years, the price of a smartphone has steadily crept up, to the point where we now expect to spend $1,000 or more on a new one.
 Not anymore. Google‚Äôs latest Pixel devices, the Pixel 3a and 3a Plus , pack all of the premium features at half the price. For $400, you get some of the Pixel‚Äôs best tricks‚Äînight sight in the camera, an adaptive battery, augmented reality built into Google Maps‚Äîplus a headphone jack! You won‚Äôt find bells and whistles like wireless charging or a 1440p display‚Äîbut for all the money you‚Äôll save, we don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll notice the difference.
Read WIRED's review of the Pixel 3a here.
 Both phones go on sale May 8.
Whether you opt for a new Pixel 3a or stick with your old Android phone, you‚Äôll soon be able to do a whole lot more, thanks to the newest version of Android. The as yet unnamed Android Q comes with some cool updates, like a Smart Reply feature that works across all your messaging apps and a Live Caption tool that translates videos when the sound isn‚Äôt on. The key here, Google says, is that none of this data leaves your phone‚Äîthe focus is on-device machine learning. You can more easily monitor your app permissions, and Google will prompt you to review which apps have access to data like your location. For families, new parental controls offer better oversight of kids‚Äô screen time, and a new Focus Mode lets you neuter distracting apps like email and the news when you‚Äôre trying to be productive.
Android Q also offers a glimpse at what Google sees as the future of mobile technology: It‚Äôs built to support foldable phones, 5G connectivity, and Dark Mode. A beta version is now available on more than 21 Android devices, with the full thing rolling out later this year.
Google says Assistant can now deliver answers and respond to requests up to 10 times faster. During an onstage demo, Google showed how you can fluidly switch between tasks and toggle across apps without having to say ‚ÄúHey Google‚Äù between requests. Assistant can also better understand the difference between requesting an action, like a command to ‚Äúsend an email to Jessica,‚Äù and dictating the message itself. This zippier Assistant comes to Pixel phones later this year.
A few other on-phone features: Personal References lets Google Assistant better understand what you mean when you say ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the weather like at Mom‚Äôs house‚Äù or ‚ÄúShow me pictures of my son.‚Äù And Driving Mode pulls up a personalized dashboard designed for when you‚Äôre in the car. Say ‚ÄúHey Google, let‚Äôs drive‚Äù and it surfaces the things you‚Äôre most likely to need while driving‚Äîyour favorite podcasts, the navigation screen‚Äîwith voice controls to control everything hands-free. That feature will be available this summer on Android phones with the Google Assistant.
Remember Duplex , Google‚Äôs eerily humanlike bot that can make restaurant reservations and schedule appointments for you over the phone? Now it can help you on the web too. Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre traveling to San Francisco and need to rent a car. Open the car rental website and Duplex automatically fills in all of the required fields‚Äîthe dates of your trip, your time of arrival, and so on‚Äîwithout you entering anything. You can double-check that everything is right before booking. Definitely not creepy.
Last year, Google introduced a set of accessibility apps called Live Transcribe and Sound Amplifier , aimed at the 466 million people in the world who are deaf or hard of hearing. Those apps leveraged Google‚Äôs speech-to-text smarts to transcribe conversations in real time.
Now, Google has a few new tricks. An assistive chat feature called Live Relay gives people the option to ‚Äútype‚Äù instead of talk on a phone call. Pichai suggested the feature could make phone calls easier for those whose speech can be difficult to understand‚Äîthose who have suffered strokes, who are deaf, or who have ALS. To that end, Google is also building out a bigger data set of voices to train its technology, so that Google Assistant and other voice interfaces can better understand those who have nontypical speech patterns.
Photograph: Google Google‚Äôs new smart display, the Nest Hub Max , works like a command center for your smart home. It can control your Nest Thermostat or your smart lights. It has a camera, so you can use it to watch cooking tutorials on YouTube, and a microphone, so you can shout at Google Assistant to turn off the timer. (You can now use a hand-waving gesture for that too.) The camera and microphone also support video chat‚Äîbut if having a camera-enabled device in your home freaks you out, there‚Äôs a physical toggle to turn them both off. Like Google‚Äôs other home devices, this one supports multiple users.
Voice Match recognizes each person in your household by the sound of their voice, and the new Face Match tells them apart through the camera. It ships this summer for $229; the older Nest Hub (n√©e Google Home Hub) is now $129.
Like everyone else in Silicon Valley, Google is getting serious about your privacy. At least, that‚Äôs what it wants you to think. Today‚Äôs presentation included more than a few mentions of Google‚Äôs commitment to privacy and some features to let you better control it. You can now enable Incognito Mode in Google Maps, so that the places you search and navigate won‚Äôt be linked to your account; soon, you‚Äôll be able to do the same in YouTube. All of your privacy and security settings have been moved to a more accessible place on your Google account, with the most relevant controls appearing first. And you can now choose to auto-delete your data after a certain number of months.
