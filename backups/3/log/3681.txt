As the “offers” space has become more popular, consumers have often found it cumbersome to take advantage of the variety and amount of deals available. Card-linked offers help solve that problem by giving merchants and advertisers the ability to deliver an offer or deal to consumers via their credit, debit or other payment cards without having to use a paper coupon, voucher or promotion code.
