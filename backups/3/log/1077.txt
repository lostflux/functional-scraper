Start by backing up your old phone. If it's an iPhone, this will make copying over your data a bit easier. The simplest method is to back up to iCloud by going to Settings , tapping on your name at the top, and choosing iCloud , iCloud Backup , and tapping Back Up Now.
 You can find alternative methods and more details in our guide on how to back up your iPhone.
 You can also take advantage of Apple's Quick Start feature for switching iPhones simply by enabling Bluetooth on your old iPhone and having it nearby when you turn the new one on. We have a guide on how to switch iPhones that goes into more depth and offers some alternative methods, but we're also going to go into it below.

On the Apps & Data screen during the setup process for your new iPhone, tap Move Data from Android.
 Go back to your Android phone, open the app, tap Continue , and follow the instructions from there. You can‚Äôt transfer everything, but you can bring over your contacts, messages, photos and videos, calendars, and email accounts. Some apps will even make the jump. Just be aware, depending on how much data you have, it can take a long time to move.
Photograph: Apple Stick your SIM card into your new iPhone (skip this step if you are using an eSIM) and hold down the power button to turn it on. You‚Äôll be greeted by the Apple logo and the word ‚ÄúHello‚Äù in many languages. You can then choose Quick Start (the easy way) or Set Up Manually (the hard way). Which path you choose depends on whether this is your first iPhone.
Photograph: Apple If you‚Äôre an Apple vet and have your old iPhone handy, try Quick Start for the fastest path to getting that new iPhone set up. Make sure your old iPhone is fully charged and that Bluetooth is turned on, then just bring your new iPhone close to your old one, and confirm that you want to use the same Apple ID on the new device. An animation should appear on your new device; hover your old one over it until that image appears in your viewfinder. Wait until you see Finish on New [Device] on your old iPhone. Enter your password at the prompt, and you‚Äôre on your way to setting up Face ID. From there, you can choose exactly what you want to back up, and which settings‚Äîincluding for Apple Watch , if you have one‚Äîyou want to carry over.

 Then enter your Apple ID and password, and go grab a peppermint mocha while your iPhone restarts with all of your settings, preferences, apps, and more in place. In other words, it‚Äôll be just like your old device, but ‚Ä¶ newer.
Photograph: Apple If this is your first Apple rodeo, or you just want a fresh start and like fiddling around in menus, select Set Up Manually.
 Follow the onscreen instructions to activate your iPhone or iPad. You will connect to your Wi-Fi network, activate your eSIM or pop your physical SIM into the new device, set up a six-digit passcode, set up Face ID or Touch ID, and restore or transfer your data and apps. (You can choose to Restore from iCloud Backup , Restore from Mac or PC , Transfer Directly from iPhone , or Move Data from Android.
) People coming from Android, remember that you can use the Move to iOS app.

You‚Äôll also be asked if you want to set up Siri (you do!), which includes saying a few phrases so the assistant can get to know your voice. Your final options relate to Screen Time , which tracks your device usage and lets you set limits, and some display settings like True Tone (where available) and Display Zoom to set icon and text size to suit you. It sounds like a lot of decisions and inputs, but the whole process takes only a few minutes. Better yet, none of these choices are binding; you can find them all again later in the Settings app.
Photograph: Apple Apple has supported eSIM technology since the iPhone XS. It's basically an electronic SIM card instead of the tiny, physical chip you insert into your phone for cellular connectivity. The iPhone 14 series were the first devices to completely get rid of the physical SIM card slot (in the US). That means the only way for you to set up a cellular connection in the US is with an eSIM.

During setup, you'll be asked if you want to transfer your number from your old iPhone. Once you agree, it will take a minute or two to activate cellular data on your new iPhone, and you're good to go. Keep in mind that your old physical SIM card will effectively stop working once you do this.
If you're coming from an Android phone (with or without eSIM support), you will need to scan a QR code provided by your carrier. This might even be the case with an iPhone if you're having trouble‚Äîjust contact your carrier and they should be able to sort things out quickly.
Otherwise, it‚Äôs just a matter of personalizing your preferences. Want to add an email account? Go to Settings , Mail , Accounts , and choose Add Account.
 Want to fine-tune which apps refresh in the background (and drain your battery in the process)? Head to Settings , General , Background App Refresh , and toggle your little heart out. Want to save time on web forms? Go to Settings , Safari , Autofill , and preload your contact info. You can also turn on the battery percentage view by going to Settings, Battery, and toggling on Battery Percentage.
Your new device will be running iOS 17, which boasts some important new features , but you should change these privacy settings right away.
One last recommendation: Get rid of the clutter. iOS now lets you delete Apple‚Äôs many, many stock apps. Do it! It feels great, I promise. We even have tips on how to customize your iPhone's home screens.
 Oh, and while you‚Äôre digging around in Apple‚Äôs software, go to Settings and then Focus to take advantage of the Do Not Disturb mode that lets you cut down on the constant stream of alerts.
Hitting these basics should get you started on the right path. When you're settled, read our hidden iPhone tips and tricks for more goodies. And if you're done with your old iPhone, read our instructions on how to factory reset it.
You got a cool gadget! You lucky duck. Now you‚Äôve gotta set it up. You poor sap.
