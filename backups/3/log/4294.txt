“When running the latest preview SDK and emulator in your local development environment, your apps will be able to access the latest Windows capabilities and APIs available in the preview build,” Microsoft program manager Clint Rutkas wrote in a blog post on the news today. “Each preview SDK release installs side by side of the official Windows 10 tooling for Visual Studio 2015.” Incidentally, Microsoft said just yesterday that Visual Studio 2015 will become available on July 20. Then, on July 29 , Microsoft will officially release Windows 10.
Early adopters in recent months have been able to try out the latest previews builds of Windows 10 through the Windows Insider Program. (You can sign up for it here.
) Microsoft has correspondingly been dropping updated SDKs for the preview builds.
Today’s new SDK preview comes with new application programming interfaces (APIs). One allows hardware makers to expose camera metadata for computer vision into universal Windows platform applications. Others can permit applications to make high-definition resolution (HDR) images. Devices that don’t natively support HDR but do support variable photo sequence (VPS) can tap a special algorithm to make HDR images.
Developers can start using the new SDK preview by downloading it and then updating Visual Studio Release Candidate, Rutkas wrote.
