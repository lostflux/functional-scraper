Nathan Drake’s greatest adventure doesn’t involve a lost city — it involves building one.
Sony is bringing characters from some of its biggest games into the block-building world of Minecraft for PlayStation 3. That includes the aforementioned Drake and his cohorts, the Hellghast from Killzone, Sly and his friends, and the four main characters from Heavy Rain. Players can purchase these in Skin Pack 1, which is available now for $1. Players can apply these skins to their characters to walk around the world of Minecraft as their favorite PlayStation persona.
Additionally, Sony is introducing the City Texture and Plastic Texture packs that will change the look of the entire game.
“For those of you who aren’t content with the classic Minecraft styling, two new texture packs are also launching,” Minecraft spokesperson Owen Hill wrote in a PlayStation blog. “The City Texture pack is perfect for the modernist Minecrafter; it’ll give your creations a more clean, clinical look. The Plastic Texture pack makes things look a lot more, erm, plasticy.” Event GamesBeat at the Game Awards We invite you to join us in LA for GamesBeat at the Game Awards event this December 7. Reserve your spot now as space is limited! Sony is playing catchup when it comes to Minecraft. The popular game, which players have downloaded over 35 million times across PC, consoles, and mobile, debuted in 2012 on Xbox 360 (a year after its PC release). It has consistently sold well on the Microsoft platform, which has likely gobbled up much of the potential audience. The PS3 version did not launch until December. By adding PlayStation-exclusive content, Sony is trying to make its late offering more appealing.
Minecraft is still due out on Xbox One as well as PlayStation 4 and Vita later this year.
