Her friend had sent her r√©sum√© to infinite job portals, only for it to seemingly disappear into a black hole. ‚ÄúShe was going around asking everyone, ‚ÄòWhat‚Äôs the trick?‚Äô‚Äù Nilizadeh remembers. Nilizadeth didn‚Äôt have job advice, but she did have an idea. A computer scientist at the University of Texas at Arlington, Nilizadeh specializes in security informatics, or the way adversaries can breach computer systems.
Oh my god , she thought.
We should hack in.
Most large companies use software in their hiring process. Programs called applicant tracking systems can sift through online applications and score them based on how well a candidate appears to match the open role. Some, like Oracle‚Äôs Taleo, can also rank applicants to give recruiters a short list of people to interview. The r√©sum√©s at the bottom of the list can end up like those from Nilizadeh‚Äôs friend, without ever seeing the light of day.
Nilizadeh devised an experiment to see if she could trick a r√©sum√©-ranking algorithm. She collected 100 r√©sum√©s from LinkedIn, GitHub, and personal websites and scraped a variety of job postings from Indeed. She then randomly enhanced some of the r√©sum√©s by embedding keywords from the job posting in the text. When she ran those through a r√©sum√©-ranking program, she found their ranking improved significantly‚Äîjumping up as many as 16 spots. It didn‚Äôt matter if the r√©sum√© listed other relevant qualifications or if it appeared to match the open role.
Nilizadeh‚Äôs experiment was purely academic: She published her results last fall, with an audience of security researchers in mind. But as software pervades the hiring process, job seekers have developed their own hacks to increase their interview chances, such as adding keywords to the metadata of their r√©sum√© file or including the names of Ivy League universities in invisible text. One person, applying for an entry-level job at Google, told me they listed their Facebook page on their r√©sum√© because they believed Google‚Äôs applicant tracking systems rewarded mentions of other large tech companies. Some applicants believe such tactics help: Marco Garcia, a master‚Äôs student at √âcole Polytechnique in France, struggled to get an interview for an internship last year until he started copying the job description of each job into his r√©sum√© in tiny white type. It was invisible to the naked eye but not to a computer. After adding the job descriptions, he told me he ‚Äúdefinitely got more interviews.‚Äù Sending a r√©sum√© is just one piece of the hiring process, and plenty of hiring still happens through referrals rather than cold applications. But since so many jobs are formally advertised online, recruiters rely on algorithms to wade through the flood. ‚ÄúYou might receive anywhere from 100 to 250 r√©sum√©s for a single job opening,‚Äù says Julie Schweber, an adviser at the Society of Human Resource Managers, who worked in HR for 18 years. Schweber says software can filter out as many as 75 percent of applicants who don‚Äôt meet the job criteria, and can help recruiters choose the small number of candidates to advance to the next level.
Software can also disadvantage certain candidates, says Joseph Fuller, a management professor at Harvard Business School. Last fall, the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission launched an initiative to examine the role of artificial intelligence in hiring, citing concerns that new technologies presented a ‚Äúa high-tech pathway to discrimination.‚Äù Around the same time, Fuller published a report suggesting that applicant tracking systems routinely exclude candidates with irregularities on their r√©sum√©s: a gap in employment, for example, or relevant skills that didn‚Äôt quite match the recruiter‚Äôs keywords. ‚ÄúWhen companies are focused on making their process hyperefficient, they can over-dignify the technology,‚Äù he says.
‚ÄúIt's more important to focus on a human looking at your r√©sum√© rather than clever tricks, like trying to stuff keywords in there.‚Äù Nate Smith, CEO, Lever To help workers get around these algorithmic gatekeepers, another group of companies offer to help job seekers optimize their r√©sum√©s. Jobscan, one such optimizer, was founded by a disgruntled job seeker who couldn‚Äôt seem to get any interviews. For $50 a month, Jobscan offers access to software that mimics an applicant tracking system. It claims to boost candidates‚Äô chances by showing them what recruiters are looking at, including r√©sum√© scores and keyword matching. It also suggests specific skills to add and edits out r√©sum√© clich√©s, like ‚Äúteam player‚Äù or ‚Äúself-starter.‚Äù The company says more than 1 million people have used its software since it launched in 2014.
Other tools, like ResyMatch and R√©sunate, help job applicants see how well their skills match a job description and suggest how often they should mention specific keywords in their r√©sum√©. Austin Belcak, who created ResyMatch, says this technique works similarly to the way people tried to boost their placement in search results in the early 2000s, where they would ‚Äútake a bunch of keywords and write them on their website in the same color as the background.‚Äù A visitor to the webpage wouldn‚Äôt notice, but Google would pick up on it and would boost the website‚Äôs page rank. Techniques have evolved since then, creating an entire field of search engine optimizers. Similarly, Belcak says it‚Äôs fairly simple to optimize a r√©sum√©, but some of the applicant tracking systems are getting smarter.

Jill Popelka, the company‚Äôs president, says the software has evolved to prevent blatant keyword stuffing‚Äîlike a person writing ‚Äúaccounting accounting accounting accounting‚Äù in white text in their r√©sum√© footer. ‚ÄúA keyword by itself is weighted less than a keyword used in the context of a sentence, such as in a candidate‚Äôs description of previous work experience,‚Äù says Popelka.
Even when an applicant can hack their way to the top of the r√©sum√© ranking, it doesn‚Äôt always help them get the job, says Nate Smith, the CEO of Lever, which also makes an applicant tracking system. ‚ÄúIt's more important to focus on a human looking at your r√©sum√© rather than clever tricks, like trying to stuff keywords in there,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThat just looks weird to a person.‚Äù Schweber, the HR veteran, said that the ranking software acts more as a guide: If the r√©sum√© doesn‚Äôt seem like a great fit, it‚Äôs not going to lead to an interview or a job offer.
To that end, recruiters are now turning to other types of assessments to evaluate job candidates, beyond their r√©sum√©s. Pymetrics, an AI job-matching platform, offers soft skills assessments in the form of little games. The company says it takes the pressure off candidates to self-report their skills and allows them to show how they might perform in a workplace. Berke, used by a number of Fortune 500 companies, offers personality assessments of job candidates, to tell hiring managers how they might fit into an existing team. The job platform Indeed also offers tools to test a job applicant‚Äôs attention to detail, critical thinking, or ability to memorize information.
The idea is that these software programs can give recruiters a more reliable sense of who they‚Äôre bringing in for an interview. That is, until job candidates find a way to hack their scores on those, too.
