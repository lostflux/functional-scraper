Sony Interactive Entertainment showed off a brutal scene from The Last of Us: Part II at Paris Games Week on Monday, and the cruelty in that clip generated a loud response from fans and others who were watching the publisher’s live show. On this week’s GamesBeat Decides podcast, hosts Jeffrey Grubb and Mike Minotti discuss why Sony would want to use shocking violence to market a blockbuster sequel.
In addition to watching The Last of Us characters smash arms in with a hammer, we also talk about some recent releases and the news. The big headlines include Microsoft dropping the Kinect, PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds fate in China, and the rest of the announcements from Paris Games week.
