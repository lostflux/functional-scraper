And the troubled platform isn’t the only well-known company downsizing. This week brought cuts at Salesforce and Meta, which eliminated 11,000 jobs , or 13 percent of its workforce. Snap, Lyft, and the payments company Stripe have also recently shrunk their payrolls, collectively shedding around 3,000 workers.
In total, more than 118,000 people have lost their jobs in tech this year, according to Layoffs.fyi , a site that tracks publicly reported job cuts in the industry. At the same time, companies including Amazon and Apple have slowed or frozen their hiring, reducing the number of open roles in Big Tech that can soak up people suddenly out of work. Yet while many individual workers must now find new jobs, the broader outlook for tech workers remains strong. Their skills are still in demand, and their peers have responded to recent cuts with a wave of grassroots support to help laid-off workers find new jobs.
Despite their command of the headlines, Big Tech companies are just one niche in the broader tech industry. Many smaller firms and companies in adjacent industries are still hiring tech workers, albeit at slower rates than tech giants recently did, and potentially for lower salaries. Some companies are now jumping at the chance to attract people previously monopolized by recruiters from the largest companies.
“These workers are at a huge advantage,” says Julia Pollak, chief economist with ZipRecruiter. “There is still strong demand for tech talent in a wide range of industries, from government to retail to agriculture. Those industries for the past years have been left in the dust.” The Big Tech forced exodus is also opening new opportunities for startups and investors aiming to create the next big thing. “To everyone affected by the Meta layoffs: Monomi Park is hiring,” Nick Popovich, CEO of an independent gaming studio, tweeted this week. Day One Ventures, a venture capital firm, responded to Big Tech’s cuts by launching an initiative aimed at laid-off workers offering to invest $100,000 in 20 different ideas for new companies. PitchBook, which tracks startup data, recently estimated that VCs have about $290 billion on hand to invest, suggesting there’s plenty of funding available for new entrepreneurs.

“You have two diverging paths for tech workers,” says Pollak. “One group is taking a flight-to-safety approach and going to companies and industries that are recession-resistant. And another group will throw caution to the wind and take a big risk and start their own companies.” Overall, the job market for tech talent remains strong. In August, the unemployment rate for tech occupations in the US stood at 2.3 percent, according to the Computing Technology Industry Association, significantly lower than the US unemployment rate of 3.7 percent that month, which is itself low by historical standards. There are an estimated 8.7 million tech workers in the US, according to numbers CompTIA released earlier this year.
At least some of the recent layoffs are less a symptom of a major turn in the economy and more a response to over-hiring by tech companies during the unexpected boom they experienced during the Covid-19 pandemic.
 “We were much too optimistic about the internet economy’s near-term growth in 2022 and 2023,” Patrick Collison, Stripe’s CEO, said in a memo to staff about the company’s layoffs. Mark Zuckerberg cited his own misreading of the pandemic internet surge in his memo to staff about Meta's job cuts. “Many people predicted this would be a permanent acceleration that would continue even after the pandemic ended,” he wrote. “I got this wrong, and I take responsibility for that.” Culture Taylor Swift and Beyoncé Are Resurrecting the American Movie Theater Angela Watercutter Gear The Best Home Depot Black Friday Deals Matt Jancer Gear Apple’s Pledge to Support RCS Messaging Could Finally Kill SMS Boone Ashworth Business Sweden’s Tesla Blockade Is Spreading Morgan Meaker The hiring pauses at companies like Amazon, Apple, and Alphabet can also be seen as signs of sober restraint, not a major crisis, says Rucha Vankudre, senior economist with the labor market analytics firm Lightcast. “Everyone is looking ahead, seeing prices are up, and trying to cut costs,” says Vankudre. Companies, she says, are “trying to be more measured.” The bigger picture may not be that reassuring to individuals who were laid off and are now scrambling to quickly find new employment or risk losing work visas. But technology workers have a tradition of banding together to help fellow techies after layoffs.
“There is a general identity of being a tech worker,” says Nataliya Nedzhvetskaya, a grad student researching sociology and employee activism at UC Berkeley and a member of Collective Action in Tech, a volunteer-run project to unite tech workers. “There’s a precedent in this industry for sharing information [and] a culture that values transparency.” Tech workers trying to soften the impact of layoffs have formed groups on LinkedIn for workers recently let go by Meta. They started and circulated a Google sheet with potential opportunities. And they’re elevating each other’s posts on LinkedIn and other social platforms to boost their audiences and catch the eye of managers who are hiring, not cutting staff.
There's also some institutional support. Coda, an online documents startup, hosts company alumni lists that laid-off workers can add their details to. Collective Action in Tech published a guide for those laid off at Twitter, including tips to help workers to understand their rights and how to communicate securely, for example by using Signal.
That swell of support is helping some tech workers stay calm even as headlines about layoffs pile up. “There’s a lot of uncertainty, and people are acknowledging that there’s going to be a lot of fluctuation,” says Nedzhvetskaya. Yet while people are understandably anxious about job losses, she says, she doesn’t see a “full-fledged panic.” You Might Also Like … 📩 Get the long view on tech with Steven Levy's Plaintext newsletter Watch this guy work, and you’ll finally understand the TikTok era How Telegram became a terrifying weapon in the Israel-Hamas War Inside Elon Musk’s first election crisis —a day after he “freed” the bird The ultra-efficient farm of the future is in the sky The best pickleball paddles for beginners and pros 🌲 Our Gear team has branched out with a new guide to the best sleeping pads and fresh picks for the best coolers and binoculars Staff Writer X Topics Silicon Valley Startups Venture Capital Work Jobs Economy Vittoria Elliott Vittoria Elliott Steven Levy Vittoria Elliott Vittoria Elliott Paresh Dave Matt Burgess Will Knight Facebook X Pinterest YouTube Instagram Tiktok More From WIRED Subscribe Newsletters Mattresses Reviews FAQ Wired Staff Coupons Black Friday Editorial Standards Archive Contact Advertise Contact Us Customer Care Jobs Press Center RSS Accessibility Help Condé Nast Store Do Not Sell My Personal Info © 2023 Condé Nast.
