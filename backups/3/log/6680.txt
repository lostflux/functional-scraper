VPNs have actually been around for more than 20 years, but it probably feels like you only started hearing about their online security powers over the past decade. Over these past few years, the virtues of a Virtual Private Network to help serve as a formidable first line of defense over all of your online activities have definitely taken hold. We’ve now up to a full third of web users who are using a VPN … which is certainly progress.
That is, of course, counterbalanced by the fact that that means two-third of web users worldwide aren’t protected by a VPN. And while more than two-thirds of American adults know what a VPN is, only 5 percent of Americans are actually using one.
Since that means most of the people you know are unprotected, this KeepSolid VPN Unlimited 2 Account Bundle deal is for you, offering a lifetime of KeepSolid VPN coverage for you, as well as that same impregnable online service for one of your nearest and dearest too.
We’re going to assume you already understand the supreme value of a VPN, but in case you need to sell this idea to a skeptical mother or a very un-tech savvy friend, we’d suggest making a few key points.
Starting with KeepSolid’s stellar reputation among VPN services. KeepSolid has been one of the VPN industry’s real standard-bearers for a long time, currently logging over 10 million users and generating high marks from noted tech outlets like Laptop Review Pro, Software Informer, and even PCMag, which honored KeepSolid with the site’s Top VPN award.
In case that doesn’t do the trick, tell your loved one that a VPN is a particularly staunch method for protecting yourself from cybercriminals and identity theft online. With a server network of more than 400 servers in over 80 locations across the globe, users can connect to the web via KeepSolid’s encrypted network, shrouding everything a user does in complete anonymity. With no access to your identifying IP address and other details, it’s nearly impossible for online crooks to steal your information or compromise your safety online.
Wrapped in KeepSolid protection, users enjoy zero speed or bandwidth issues, even when using potentially dodgy public WiFi networks.
In addition to military-grade AES 256-bit encryption, you can also sell friends and family on the fact that a VPN can get them around international content restrictions, allowing them to access streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, ESPN+, and HBO Now no matter where they are anywhere in the world.
A lifetime of KeepSolid VPN Unlimited protection is usually a $199 value, which would make the cost of two subscriptions almost $400. But as part of the limited-time Memorial Day Sale, you can land two KeepSolid subscriptions now for a radically low $55.
 The deal is only available for the next few days until June 2 — then it’s gone.
