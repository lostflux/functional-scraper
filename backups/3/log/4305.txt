Game publishers covet any nods they can get from the prestigious Game Critics Awards for the best games of the Electronic Entertainment Expo industry tradeshow. I participated again this year and voted for my favorites at the show.
This year, the big winners included Electronic Arts’ Star Wars: Battlefront, with five nominations. That was followed by four nominations each for Guerrilla Games’ Horizon: Zero Dawn and Bethesda Softworks’ Fallout 4.
Here’s the nominees below. My own votes matched up pretty well with the winners. I’ll be voting in the final tally as well. (Note: I didn’t vote in categories where I couldn’t come up with three nominees).
