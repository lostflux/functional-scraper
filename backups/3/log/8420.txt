It does so with all the trappings of a hit: a competitive price, popular franchises stacked to the ceiling, Forky. Even more important to its inevitable success, though, is what it exhibits few signs of: growing pains.
Athena seems like a hifalutin metaphor for yet another streaming service from a multinational megacorp. But go with it for a second, because it gets at what makes Disney+ singular more than the ever-expanding Star Wars universe ever could. It‚Äôs that Disney+ is bursting into existence fully formed, straight from the noggin of Disney CEO Bob Iger.
It‚Äôs hard to overstate the advantage this gives Disney over fellow newcomers like Apple TV+ and the forthcoming HBO Max. And it's important to understand that Disney‚Äôs head start comes not only from its extensive back catalog of TV shows and movies but also from a technological prowess in this space that that few companies can match.
Start with the fun part. At launch, Disney+ will bring to bear the full power of not just Mickey and friends but Marvel, Pixar, and Star Wars, along with a heaping helping of Fox and National Geographic. It‚Äôll have fewer total hours of stuff to watch than Netflix does, but also substantially less filler.
More importantly, it can offer most of those movies and TV shows from day one, including franchises with shelf lives that are measured in the decades. (A few exceptions, like Mary Poppins Returns , are tied up with licensing agreements elsewhere, but will make it over the transom eventually.) That means Disney+ will enter the market at $7 per month with confirmed hits, rather than plodding through years of trial and error to find a show or two that sticks.

That‚Äôs not a knock on Apple, which is both starting from scratch and effectively giving its streaming service away to anyone who buys one of its devices; it‚Äôs like getting a branded koozie along with a large appliance purchase. But it does speak to all the trouble Disney doesn‚Äôt have to go through to build out its stable.
‚ÄúDisney knows it has an audience,‚Äù says Dan Rayburn, a streaming media analyst with Frost and Sullivan. ‚ÄúApple‚Äôs never been known for content, because they‚Äôve never been in that space. So it‚Äôs much more difficult for them to find an audience and say, ‚ÄòWhat does my audience want to watch, what do they want to see?‚Äô‚Äù That process can take years. Just ask Netflix or Amazon. The former relied on licensing outside content for years‚Äîmost notably from Starz, which sent Netflix subscribers reeling when it pulled out of the deal in 2011‚Äîbefore finally striking oil with House of Cards two years later. But even now, Netflix is spending an estimated $15 billion on original content this year alone, in search of the next big hit. To build up its arsenal, Amazon spent its early years asking Prime members to vote on which TV show pilots they wanted to see more of.

It will launch with instantly recognizable, universally beloved movies and shows. (Along with plenty that are ‚Ä¶ less so.
) Because it owns all of that intellectual property, it can show them all over the world without navigating the thickets of local licensing agreements Netflix still contends with regularly. And as Disney continues fills out its library with new projects, it knows full well who its customers are and what they like. It‚Äôs been at this game for nearly a century.
In the long run, that could place a cap on Disney‚Äôs streaming appeal. ‚ÄúDisney+ is not going to be a generalist service like Netflix or, to some extent, even Amazon,‚Äù says Tony Gunnarsson, streaming media analyst at Ovum. ‚ÄúIt will be Disney titles only. I think that will be the most important thing to bear in mind.‚Äù Still, ‚ÄúDisney titles only‚Äù is miles ahead of where any other streaming service started. Not to mention that Disney knows how to get them to you without a hiccup.
Having hours of highly watchable stuff isn‚Äôt enough. As anyone who‚Äôs struggled to stream Game of Thrones knows, the infrastructure that gets those shows to paying customers is every bit as important.
Disney knows that too, and better than you might think. In 2017, it put down $1.58 billion to gain a majority stake in BAMTech, a company that grew out of Major League Baseball Advanced Media in the early aughts. Without getting into a deep history of online streaming infrastructure, know that BAMTech is the gold standard, for years supporting everything from Major League Baseball to WWE to Disney-owned Hulu. Last year, Disney renamed BAMTech internally as Disney Streaming Services.
Throughout its various iterations, BAMTech has proven itself unflappable. The unpredictable popularity of baseball games taught it how to balance loads and handle usage spikes. Its work streaming those games to the MLB.tv app as early as 2009 means it‚Äôs logged more years of service delivering video to iOS devices than just about anybody. (Netflix‚Äôs iOS app launched in 2010.) The actual Disney+ launch could still have issues. Having BAMTech on board, though, gives Disney the best possible chance at pulling it off without a hitch. It‚Äôs an advantage that another looming competitor‚ÄîAT&T-owned HBO Max, which can almost rival Disney+ for sheer size‚Äîvery notably lacks. To pull off its streaming ambitions, AT&T needs to somehow bring its disparate properties at HBO, CNN, TBS, TNT, Cartoon Network, Adult Swim, Warner Bros., and more onto one shared platform.

And the reason for that is they bought the company that has the most expertise in this space.‚Äù That expertise extends beyond the nuts and bolts of pushing encoded video across various pipes. BAMTech can handle credit cards and authentication and subscriptions and all of the other unglamorous aspects that make streaming services actually run. It even knows how to sell tickets, thanks to its MLB roots.
‚ÄúDisney has a huge advantage over everybody because of the expertise of BAMTech,‚Äù says Rayburn, especially when it comes to relatively new entrants. Netflix may have every bit as sophisticated a backend, but it took years to build out.
That‚Äôs the real story of Disney+, and the reason it deserves more attention than some of its fellow flashy upstarts. This may be its first day, but it‚Äôs got one hell of a head start.
