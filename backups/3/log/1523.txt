Photograph: Graham Turner for the Guardian Shortcuts Google Demis Hassabis: 15 facts about the DeepMind Technologies founder Now 37, Hassabis was born in London in July 1976 and quickly showed academic promise and skill with board games, especially chess.
At the ages of 13 Hassabis reached the rank of chess master, and was the second-highest-rated player in the world under 14 at the time – beaten only by the Hungarian chess grandmaster and strongest female chess player in history, Judit Polgár.
Accelerated through school, Hassabis completed his A-level exams two years early.
He began a career in video games at British studio Bullfrog Productions , co-designing and lead programming on the classic game Theme Park at 17 years old, alongside the legendary games designer Peter Molyneux.
Released in 1994, Theme Park sold several million copies and won a Golden Joystick award. The game set players the task of building a successful theme park in the UK with just a few thousand pounds and a small plot of land. (Strategies for success in the game included putting more salt in crisps so people would buy more drinks, making queues long but fast-moving and obscuring the destination, hiring a cleaner to clean the toilets, and placing the exit of one roller-coaster close to the entrance of the next to minimise walking distance between attractions.) Hassabis left Bullfrog to study Computer Science Tripos at Cambridge University, which in 1953 had the world's first undergraduate computer science course. He graduated from Queens' College Cambridge with a double first-class honours degree in 1997.
After graduation, Hassabis rejoined Molyneux, who had now set up another games developer called Lionhead Studios , a breakaway from developer Bullfrog. Hassabis briefly worked as a lead AI programmer on the title Black & White , a game that allowed gamers to play the role of a god ruling over an island populated by various tribes.
In 1998, Hassabis left Lionhead Studios to found his own London-based independent games developer, Elixir Studios.
 The company grew to 60 people strong and signed deals with large publishers Vivendi Universal and Microsoft. His games included Republic: The Revolution and Evil Genius.
 The intellectual property and technology rights from Elixir Studios were sold to various games publishers and the studio was closed in April 2005.

Hassabis was later elected as a fellow of the Royal Society of Arts in 2009 for his influential game-design work and contribution to the games industry.
Hassabis then changed tack, switching from games development to a career in cognitive neuroscience, to allow him to return to his primary interest in artificial intelligence. During the course of a PhD in cognitive neuroscience at University College London (UCL), Hassabis published several influential papers concerning memory and amnesia.
His work was listed as in the top 10 scientific breakthroughs of 2007 by Science magazine. Hassabis established a new theory around the way the mind creates and maintains the context of remembered events as a key process underlying both the recall of memories and imagination. Some of Hassabis's findings were subsequently disputed by experts in the field; the debate is still ongoing.
Hassabis received his PhD in cognitive neuroscience from University College London in 2009. He continued his neuroscience and AI research at the Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit at UCL as a Wellcome Trust research fellow. He was also a visiting researcher jointly at MIT and Harvard.
In 2011 he left academia to co-found a London-based artificial intelligence startup, DeepMind Technologies, with Shane Legg, whom he met at UCL, and Mustafa Suleyman. Among other things, the company developed a computer system capable of understanding and playing an Atari computer game simply by looking at it on a screen as a human would.
On 27 January, DeepMind was acquired by Google for £400m – the company's largest European acquisition – in order to add technology and talent to Google's core business of search. Google uses AI to understand search queries providing context awareness and allowing users to talk to the computer as they would a human, whether by voice or using a keyboard.
