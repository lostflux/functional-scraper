Kambule Dr Thamsanqa “Wilkie” Kambule, one of South Africa's greatest mathematicians and teachers, is remembered for his life’s contribution to education, specifically black education under the Bantu Education Act, a segregated education system enforced by the apartheid regime. Through his teaching, 20 years of which he was the principal of Orlando High School in Soweto, he went on to shape and influence many great minds, including Nobel Peace Prize winner Desmond Tutu, former national police commissioner Jackie Selebi, and former chief executive officer of the Independent Electoral Commission Pansy Tlakula. Alongside his passion for teaching, he was also a gifted mathematician. He was awarded honorary doctorate degrees from the universities of the Witwatersrand, Pretoria and Fort Hare, and was the University of the Witwatersrand’s first black professor in mathematics. In 2002, former South African president Thabo Mbeki bestowed him with an Order of the Baobab in gold for his exceptional contribution to mathematics, education, human development and community service, and in 2008 went on to be awarded an honorary membership of the Actuarial Society of South Africa, a membership he was denied during Apartheid. The Thamsanqa Kambule Doctoral Dissertation Award is established in honour of his contributions to the field of mathematics and his dedication to furthering the minds of his students.
