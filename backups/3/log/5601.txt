On this episode, we have only the latest in entertainment. That includes … Super Mario Bros. 3 and The Legend of Zelda? Well, co-host Jeffrey Grubb has at least spent some time with Forza Horizon 4 and Assassin’s Creed: Odyssey. He dives into both of those, while fellow co-host Mike Minotti wastes his life with NES Nintendo Switch Online games.
Before getting into the news, Mike and Jeff talk about the 5 bad PlayStation games they want on the PlayStation Classic.
In the headlines, the pair talk about the tragic end of Telltale Games and unionization. Then it’s a lot of PlayStation news. Sony is permitting crossplay now. The Vita is dead. And you can download PlayStation Now games.
