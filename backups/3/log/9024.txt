Usually, their arrival means wildfires are on the way, a recurring threat to life and property thanks to climate change and urban sprawl.
This time was a little different, though. As The New York Times points out , five out of the 10 most destructive wildfires in California history were at least in part the fault of equipment belonging to Pacific Gas & Electric, the utility company that delivers power to 16 million people in the top half of the state. In part because of liability claims from victims of past fires, $8.4 billion worth, PG&E is in the midst of bankruptcy.
 So this time, when the red wind started to blow, PG&E turned off the power.
Did they do it out of an overabundance of caution and concern for safety? Definitely. But at least one expert suspects another set of priorities at work: PG&E’s ongoing bankruptcy negotiations.
A core function of bankruptcy is to let a business continue to operate while it figures out what it owes, and to whom. PG&E has spent hundreds of millions of dollars to figure that out. “If the assumptions in your analysis turn out to be wrong, your whole strategy can blow up and be immensely costly, and delay your bankruptcy,” says Jared Ellias, an expert in bankruptcy law at UC Hastings College of the Law. That means you try to get through it fast, and with minimal chaos.
A wildfire would definitely qualify as chaos. In large part, that’s because of the damages PG&E is on the hook for. Expenses incurred during a bankruptcy take precedence over the ones from before the bankruptcy. The bills are, in the language of the law, “senior.” Ellias says that while damages are supposed to get paid out of a common pot, claims from victims of a fire in 2019 could in this case supersede those of earlier victims.
The rules get more complicated than that. This summer California passed a law called AB 1054, which set terms for how PG&E will pay out claims for previous fires and established a $20 billion insurance fund to pay future claims. That carefully negotiated, controversial plan didn’t take into account what would happen if a massive fire happened right now. “Of greater significance to PG&E is the fact that it cannot access the ‘insurance’ fund established by AB 1054 for fires this season,” writes Mike Danko, a lawyer representing fire victims, in an email. “Those funds would be available to PG&E for fires beginning in 2020, at the earliest—another reason for PG&E to protect itself at the expense of the ratepayers by turning off power, even if not really necessary.” Culture Taylor Swift and Beyoncé Are Resurrecting the American Movie Theater Angela Watercutter Gear The Best Home Depot Black Friday Deals Matt Jancer Gear Apple’s Pledge to Support RCS Messaging Could Finally Kill SMS Boone Ashworth Business Sweden’s Tesla Blockade Is Spreading Morgan Meaker So a fire in 2019 would be a mess. “If you’re well advised by great lawyers, which they are, as much as you always don’t want a fire to happen, you really don’t want one right now,” Ellias says. “Imagine how ugly it would get if you had a competition between bankruptcy fire victims and pre-bankruptcy fire victims. That would be ugly, ugly, ugly—ugly for the people involved, ugly for the representatives in Sacramento.” PG&E then looks, let’s say, highly incentivized. In mid-October 2018, it shut off power over a wide swath of the North Bay and Sierra Nevada mountains in advance of a predicted wind event. On November 6, 2018, PG&E warned 70,000 customers that it might do it again, but then did not. Two days later, a tower on PG&E’s Caribou-Palermo transmission line caught fire , sparking the Camp Fire, which destroyed the town of Paradise and killed 88 people , making it the deadliest wildfire in the US in a century.
To be clear, the power shutdown seems to be doing what it was supposed to. Starting Wednesday, more than 700,000 bill-payers—perhaps 2 million people— went dark , from the state’s northern marijuana- and wine-growing regions to the hills of the East Bay and the ocean-facing side of the Silicon Valley peninsula.
 Since then, a few small fires have broken out, but nothing on the order of last year’s massive blazes. Still, it’s unclear why PG&E shut down such a large area, or what criteria the agency used to activate its Public Safety Power Shutoff program. “Many questions remain as the state reels with the consequences of this decision,” wrote state senator Jerry Hill to the California Public Utilities Commission. “I strongly disagree with the binary position currently offered by PG&E—they can turn the power off and shut down the economy and livelihoods of millions in California, an action which may protect us from wildfire; or they can roll the dice and continue with the lights on.” PG&E says the reason for the shutoff is right there in the name. “We faced a choice between hardship or safety, and we chose safety,” said Michael Lewis, PG&E’s senior vice president for electric operations, in a press statement. “We deeply apologize for the inconvenience and the hardship, but we stand by the decision because the safety of our customers and communities must come first.” Culture Taylor Swift and Beyoncé Are Resurrecting the American Movie Theater Angela Watercutter Gear The Best Home Depot Black Friday Deals Matt Jancer Gear Apple’s Pledge to Support RCS Messaging Could Finally Kill SMS Boone Ashworth Business Sweden’s Tesla Blockade Is Spreading Morgan Meaker PG&E denies that its financial travails had anything to do with the decision to turn off the power. “This has nothing to do with the bankruptcy,” says Lynsey Paulo, a spokesperson for the company. “This is about reducing wildfire risk and keeping our customers and community safe.” Its power shutoff program, she adds, has expanded since 2018 to include both distribution lines as well as bigger transmission lines, part of a comprehensive Community Wildfire Safety Program “to harden our system so it can withstand extreme weather.” In addition to shutdowns, that includes “vegetation management,” inspections of equipment, and new weather stations and fire-monitoring cameras. (In April, a federal judge chided PG&E —at a probation hearing stemming from a whole other deadly equipment failure —for spending $4.5 billion on dividends, but pleading poverty when it came to tree-trimming.
) Yes, shutting off the power was about public safety. But in this case, that decision was at least semi-aligned with bankruptcy prep and shareholder value. “The company is currently controlled by the board of directors, who work for the shareholders, and the shareholders sit behind pre-bankruptcy fire victims in the pecking order,” Ellias of UC Hastings says. “So from their perspective, if the board cares about the shareholders, any fire during the bankruptcy would wipe out the shareholders. And they have been trying very hard to avoid wiping out their shareholders.” This is what retreat in the face of climate change looks like: letting cities go dark. It’s not as obvious as abandoning coasts ahead of rising seas, but this week a utility responsible for as many people as the entire population of Cambodia has essentially declared, "We can’t provide electricity safely because of climate change." Still, worsening wildfires are just a hazard; it took bad management, deferred maintenance, and urban sprawl to turn them into a disaster.
