It’s the last day of 2014, so let’s look back at what people spent all their cash on.
The United Kingdom’s Entertainment Retailer’s Association just sent out its list of the top 20 best-selling physical albums, movies, and games. As far as gaming is concerned, publisher Electronic Arts’ soccer sim FIFA 15 outsold all other pieces of media in the U.K. throughout the last 12 months. Consumers purchased more than 2.6 million copies of the game, which put it over Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare. That Activision-published shooter racked up 1.8 million copies sold.
Other top performing games include Grand Theft Auto V and Destiny — although all games, movies, and albums were outsold by Disney’s phenomenally popular animated film Frozen.
