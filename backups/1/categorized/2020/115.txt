Construction Construction Archives Cooling Tower Area Equipment installation advances In the heat rejection zone, the ITER Organization is installing equipment supplied by the Indian Domestic Agency. Follow all installation and commissioning news on the assembly pages of the ITER website (https://www.iter.org/construction/assembly). Â© Les Nouveaux MÃ©dias/SNC ENGAGE 22 December 2020 Download Cooling tower area ITER's heat rejection system, including 10 cooling towers, seen from the air. Â© Les Nouveaux MÃ©dias/SNC ENGAGE 15 June 2020 Download Towers equipped Ten fans have now been installed at the top of the building, one for each cooling tower. Photo: ITER Organization/EJF Riche 28 May 2020 Download 6,000 square metres The concrete batching plant has been removed from the platform (left) and the cooling plant is expanding into the zone. In all, it will cover a 6,000-square-metre area. Photo : ITER Organization/EJF Riche 27 May 2020 Download From river to droplets and mist Large fans at the top of the cooling tower building will induce an upward airstream that accelerates the evaporation process. Photo : ITER Organization/EJF Riche 25 May 2020 Download Next step: large fans At the top of the building each cooling cell is topped by a "fan cylinder." Once installed, the twelve-blade fans will induce an upward draft.
22 January 2020 Download Zigzag shape In order to recapture the water droplets that would be otherwise scattered by the upward draft, close to 4,500 "drift eliminator" packs located at the top of each cell provide a dense, zigzagging labyrinth that forces droplets to change direction, lose velocity and fall back into the cooling tower.
22 January 2020 Download Cylinders, rotors and motors A 3-tonne fan cylinder is being lifted into its final position above the cooling cell. The fan rotor (light grey), connected through a shaft to a 170 kW electrical motor (blue), is ready to be fitted with twelve 5-metre long plastic blades.
22 January 2020 Download Ready to lift Three "fan cylinders" made of fibre-reinforced plastic are ready to be lifted and installed on the roof. Each one measures more than 11 metres in diameter and weighs approximately 3 tonnes.
22 January 2020 Download First blade Rotating at 92 rpm, a large twelve-blade fan on top of each cell induces the upward draft that optimizes the cooling process. Here, inside a newly installed fan cylinder, the fan's rotor has just been equipped with its first blade.
22 January 2020 Download Fill packs Inside each cooling cell, stacked layers of millimetre-thick corrugated plastic sheet (''fill pack'') act like the honeycomb structure of a car radiator. (Look closely at the black ''floor.'') 22 January 2020 Download Last stop It all ends up here, in the 6,000-square-metre heat rejection zone. The squat black building to the left hosts the 10 cooling cells that are tasked with evacuating the heat generated by operation; to the right, a complex network of piping, pumps and heat exchangers connects the installation's cooling loops to the cells and the underground hot and cold basins.
22 January 2020 Download Evacuating 1 GW Cooling water flows through approximately 5 kilometres of piping and 17 heat exchangers inside the heat rejection zone. At full power, the combined load that needs to be evacuated is on the order of one gigawatt, approximately half generated by the burning plasma inside the Tokamak.
22 January 2020 Download 4,540 nozzles A set of 4,540 nozzles sprays the water coming in from the installation's cooling system over the stacked fill-pack layers. If unfolded, the total heat exchange surface provided by the fill pack would be approximately 704,000 square metres, the approximate equivalent of 70 soccer pitches.
22 January 2020 Download 10t of water per second Thirteen large vertical turbine pumps (in blue), each one powered by a 870 kW motor and capable of moving 10 tonnes of water per second, circulate water throughout the heat rejection system.
22 January 2020 Download Cooling tower installation underway Cooling water will flow from the Tokamak machine to the heat rejection zone (pictured) at rates of up to 14 mÂ³/s. Equipment arriving from India is being installed by ITER Organization contractors inside of infrastructure prepared by Europe.
08 January 2020 Download Installation of cooling fans Ten 16 x 16-metre cooling cells will receive water from the hot basin and discharge itâ€”once cooledâ€”to the cold basin. Each cell is filled with hundreds of layers of corrugated plastic fill and equipped with a large fan (installation underway at the top of the building) that pulls air upward.
16 December 2019 Download Ten cooling towers The first two fan cylinders are positioned near the cooling tower facility, ready to be lifted to the top. Â© Les Nouveaux MÃ©dias/SNC ENGAGE 04 December 2019 Download 10-metre-long shafts Thirteen vertical turbine pumps will take cooling water from deep in the hot basins and circulate it either to the cold basin, or through the installation's heat exchangers. The shafts, pictured, connect the rotor (impeller) to the motor.
23 September 2019 Download Preciseness counts Each six-tonne vertical shaft must be perfectly positioned and balanced to withstand the considerable forces that the rotation of the impeller and the flux of water exert. Horizontal deflection at the bearings cannot exceed 0.05 millimetre.
23 September 2019 Download To be repeated 13 times Workers install the vertical turbine pump shafts in each pump housing. The 10-metre-long shafts connect the rotor (or impeller) to a powerful 870 kW electrical motor.
16 September 2019 Download Ready for use One of 13 vertical turbine shafts is moved from storage to the heat rejection zone for installation over the hot basin.
11 September 2019 Download Pumping up ITER Organization contractors are managing equipment installation in the cooling tower zone. The infrastructure of the zone was provided by Europe; the design and fabrication of heat rejection equipment is part of India's procurement contributions to the ITER Project.
04 September 2019 Download Last stop for the heat of the tokamak Above the hot basin, contractors are supervising the installation of large lengths of piping. Over 5 km of piping is necessary to receive cooling water from the machine and plant systems and cycle it through the cooling water system, including 20-metre-tall cooling tower cells.
04 September 2019 Download Basins hidden The deep basins of the thermal rejection system were once visible in this corner of the platform. Now they have been covered over by the cooling towers (far left) and other heat removal infrastructure. Â© Les Nouveaux MÃ©dias/SNC ENGAGE 28 August 2019 Download Pump station 1 Equipment provided by India has been installed in one of the two pump stations planned on site.
07 August 2019 Download Next to be installed: large updraft fans The cooling tower zone is taking shape. A pump station has been erected (right, near the orange crane) and large cooling fans have arrived on site for installation in the cooling tower building.
06 August 2019 Download Cladding underway The cladding of the cooling water tower is progressing. The lower sides of the structure will remain open to facilitate air flow induced by large fans on the roof. The resulting draft will cool down the water falling through thousands of corrugated plastic sheets inside the tower.
12 April 2019 Download Hot basin During the ceremony participants were given access to the underground hot basin. During the machine's operational phase, water can enter the hot basin at up to 65 Â°C.
21 December 2018 Download Infrastructure completed On 21 December, the European Domestic Agency hands the completed cooling tower zone over to the ITER Organization for equipment installation. The areas handed over include the cold and hot basins, the water cooling pumping station, the heat exchange zone, and the water treatment facility.
21 December 2018 Download Heat rejection On the northern tip of the worksite the 6,000 mÂ² heat rejection zone is emerging. The most recent structure, in black, will house the 10-cell, 20-metre-tall cooling tower.
12 December 2018 Download Specially designed for ITER The cooling towers are one part of a high-performance heat rejection system that has been designed for ITER. The design and fabrication of the system is part of India's procurement contributions to the ITER Project; Europe has created the concrete basins and infrastructure; the equipment will be installed by the ITER Organization.
12 December 2018 Download One structure, 10 cells Each of the 20-metre-tall cooling tower cells will be filled with hundreds of layers of corrugated plastic fill and equipped with a large fan that pulls air upward. As water falls through the fill, some of it evaporates due to the strong uptake of air, removing heat. The dark-grey support structure for the cooling tower cells is made of pultruded fibre-reinforced polymer beams.
12 December 2018 Download Rushing water The cooling water circulating through the different cooling loops of the ITER installation will be directed toward the heat rejection zone through galleries like this. The maximum total flow rate during operation is 14 mÂ³/s. Â© Les Nouveaux MÃ©dias/SNC ENGAGE 05 October 2018 Download In September, the first structures appear If you look closely, you'll see the first cooling tower structures rising in the fourth and fifth cooling tower cells.

Only residual heat would need to be dissipated. In ITER, a high-performance heat rejection system has been designed and is under construction.
Heat rejection The heat rejection system must handle the large, intermittent heat loads from Tokamak pulse operations plus normal facility heat loads, while maintaining stable and predictable cooling tower basin water temperatures to meet the needs of cooling water system clients.
