$(document).ready(function(){ // Opening popup with dedicated list function openPop(width, list){ $('.inline-pop').colorbox({ iframe:true, opacity:0.8, href:"/ajax/www/popups/wd_700/lang_/urldepth_0/id_" + list, width: "65%", scrolling: false, }); } // definition popup $('a.definition').each(function() { var widthValue = $(this).data('width') + 'px'; $(this).qtip({ content: { text: function(event, api) { $.ajax({ url: api.elements.target.attr('data-source') // Use href attribute as URL }) .then(function(content) { // Set the tooltip content upon successful retrieval api.set('content.text', content); }, function(xhr, status, error) { // Upon failure... set the tooltip content to error api.set('content.text', status + ': ' + error); }); return 'Loading...'; // Set some initial text } }, position: { viewport: $(window), target: 'mouse' }, style: { classes: 'qtip-rounded qtip-wiki', // No additional classes added to .qtip element width: widthValue } }); }); }) Assembly will proceed bottom to top. Beginning with the heaviest single componentâ€”the 1,250-tonne cryostat baseâ€”Assembly Phase I operations will continue with the installation of lower cryostat components; the nine large, 40Â° vacuum vessel sectors (pre-assembled with thermal shield panels and a pair of toroidal field coils); the components at the top of the machine; and finally the cryostat lid.

The Cleaning Facility operates as an airlock between the Hall and the outside environment.

Then, in the order determined by assembly sequences, the components or assemblies are transported to the Tokamak Building.

Each ITER component is absolutely uniqueâ€”and in many cases has required up to five years to manufacture. Every possible precaution is taken in their unloading and transport.

Repair strategies have been decided and contracts signed (summer 2023). Repair work is getting underway.

13 September 2023 Download Protected in pink Eighteen supports for the toroidal field magnets are protected in pink plastic. Just inside the circle formed by the supports is poloidal field magnet #5.
07 September 2023 Download Central solenoid: now a two-module stack Lifted by a bespoke tool exercising pressure through radial compression, a second 110-tonne central solenoid module is positioned on the assembly platform above the first. (A third waits its turn on the left.) 05 September 2023 Download Pin-point precision It takes a whole range of tools to position the 110-tonne component with the required precision: once cranes and ''synch hoists'' have done the heavy job, a complex system of subtle adjustment devices allows micrometric movements in pitch, roll and spin.
05 September 2023 Download Small adjustments Stacking cylindrical devices and connecting their fragile electrical and cryogenics leads demands a particular attention to concentricity and straightness.
05 September 2023 Download Thermal shield repair/replacement contracts signed For vacuum vessel thermal shield sectors showing no sign of stress corrosion cracking, the panels can be repaired. The initial scope of the repair contract is for two sector sets to be disassembled at ITER, repaired at the contractor's premises, and returned. For thermal shield sectors already compromised by damage, complete re-fabrication is necessary. See news about thermal shield repair/replacement contracts here: https://www.iter.org/newsline/-/3914 30 August 2023 Download Thermal shield: metrology underway Metrology is underway on outboard segments of thermal shield at one end of the Poloidal Field Coils Winding Facility on site.
30 August 2023 Download Sector module #8 Vacuum vessel sector #8, seen here in a horizontal position on the upending tool, was removed from vertical tooling when it became evident that sector #6 (already in the pit) would need to be removed and repaired alongside sector #7. Sector #8 will be repaired horizontally in the former Cryostat Workshop.
29 August 2023 Download Disassembly works Disassembly of sector module #7 is well advanced; thermal shield panels have been removed and toroidal field coils have been dissociated. In this striking view taken from under the tool, the sector's "underbelly" is clearly visible, as are the toroidal field coils on either side in the tool "wings." 29 August 2023 Download Next cylindrical magnet in line This cylindrical, 110-tonne central solenoid magnet, delivered by the United States Domestic Agency, has been unwrapped to prepare for its installation on the dedicated assembly platform in the right corner of the photo.
29 August 2023 Download Thermal shield panels These are some of the 27 vacuum vessel thermal shield panels that must be repaired or replaced to correct stress corrosion cracking in the cooling pipes. In September, the ITER Newsline will have a full report on repair strategies and contracts.

05 July 2023 Download Reverse operation Lessons learned during the May 2022 installation of the sector module were essential to the reverse operation. So too was the fact that the same team was on deck... (Photo Kenichi Ueno, ITER) 05 July 2023 Download Rotating The load has now passed the wall and will be rotated 90 degrees to face the sector sub-assembly tool closest to the wall.
05 July 2023 Download Carefully now One of the most delicate passages: the toroidal field coil termination boxes (wrapped in protective pink plastic) are the most sensitive and delicate parts of the assembly. When passing the wall that separates the assembly pit from the Assembly Hall, the vertical clearance is less than 20 centimetres.
05 July 2023 Download Back towards the Assembly Hall Sector module #6 follows the same path out of the assembly pit as it did 15 months ago on its way in.
05 July 2023 Download Watching the weight The load supported by each of the four crane hooks is displayed in real time on small screens, so the math is easily done: the module weighs slightly in excess of 1,350 tonnes.
05 July 2023 Download Step by step From detaching the module from its moorings in the assembly pit to lifting and transporting it to the sub-assembly tool, more than one hundred different steps had to be defined, validated and integrated into the lift procedure.
05 July 2023 Download A few centimetres At its narrowest, the clearance between the module and the central column does not exceed a few centimetres. The lift is paused at regular intervals to slow the swinging effect.
05 July 2023 Download Eagle eyes Although the lift operation relied heavily on sensors and strategically positioned cameras, "spotters" played a crucial role in overall safety and precision.
05 July 2023 Download Sector module #6 removed Sector module #6 (1,350 tonnes) is removed from the Tokamak pit on 5 July 2023. See: https://www.iter.org/newsline/-/3904 05 July 2023 Download Final instrument checks "A lift-off is not exactly the reverse of a landing," says Daniel Coelho, the ITER assembly engineer who will coordinate the lift operation. Procedures have had to be adapted and additional guiding systems have had to be manufactured and installed.
04 July 2023 Download Planning removal The paperwork is done. Every tool and system has been checked. A "functional briefing" has reminded everyone involved of how the operation will proceed and clarified the chain of command. This week, the delicate and complex "extraction" of vacuum vessel sector module #6 from the assembly pit (in the background) will take place.
03 July 2023 Download Reverse lift imminent Late June, technicians were busy preparing sector module #6 for removal from the pit.

(At the base of the column, a worker with a blue hard hat provides a sense of scale.) 28 June 2023 Download A window into the Tokamak pit On Saturday 24 June, Open Doors Day groups are taken through a port cell to the edge of the Tokamak pit. They are among the last people to see sector module #6 in place in the pit, since it is scheduled for removal (within days) for repair.
24 June 2023 Download Sector tools In the background, vacuum vessel sector #7 is suspended in tooling, and its two D-shaped toroidal field coils have been removed to the wings. The second tool, further to the back of the Hall, awaits sector module #6 from the machine pit.
24 June 2023 Download Extra support from below A temporary propping system is in place to support the central column tool (in the centre of the Tokamak pit) during machine assembly. These propping elements have been installed under the concrete slab of the Tokamak Complex, directly under the machine. Read all about it here: https://www.iter.org/newsline/-/3886 01 June 2023 Download Preparing for repair work The same tools that were used for assembling the vacuum vessel sector modules from 1 sector, 2 toroidal field coils and thermal shield panels, is now being used for disassembly. In this photo, two toroidal field coils are temporarily held after disassembly on the wings of vertical tool SSAT-2.
11 May 2023 Download Musical chairs The view inside the Assembly Hall now gives a clear indication of what will happen soon: to the left sector #7 stands in the tall assembly tool SSAT-1, ready for repairs once the outboard thermal shield panel is removed. To the right, sector #8 is solidly attached to the upending tool, waiting to be moved from vertical to horizontal and transported to another building.

Dimensional control will be critical to ensuring that tolerances are respected, and to recording the "as-built" status of the machine, which will be directly compared against ITER's Computer-Aided-Design (CAD) models in order to correct eventual deviations in alignment before they accumulate. Positional tolerances for the largest components, including the magnet coils and the vacuum vessel, are as low as 2 mm.

The welding tools will have to manoeuvre the complex geometry of the sectors and ports and reach areas that are not directly accessible to operators and where visibility is restricted. The robots will also be confined to welding from inside the vessel and ports, as the pre-installed vacuum vessel thermal shield makes access to the exterior surfaces impossible. Extensive trials on mockups have been performed to quantify and plan for shrinkage, and to qualify tools, processes, and inspection techniques.

To ensure correct machine performance, all connections associated with ultra-high vacuum or high vacuum components must be 100 percent leak-tight. Vacuum lines, helium lines, pipes, valves, seals, joints, and/or flanges have all gone through pre-qualification, while some of the largest vacuum componentsâ€”for example, the seals manufactured for the vacuum vessel's 50+ large portsâ€”are being tested on dedicated test rigs. During in-pit assembly, only qualified welding procedures, carried out by certified professionals, will be employed, and the quality of all vacuum-related welds will be verified by surface and volumetric non-destructive examination. Full-scale leak testing is planned during the 12-month integrated commissioning period before First Plasma, during which the large vacuum chambersâ€”the vacuum vessel and the cryostatâ€”will be evacuated and leak tested. In parallel, the ITER Organization is developing a set of specialized tools and technologies for the localization and detection of leaks smaller than the width of hair divided by one million.
