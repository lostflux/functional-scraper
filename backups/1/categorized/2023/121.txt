The capstone course is designed to apply knowledge into practice and to develop and improve critical skills such as problem-solving and collaboration skills.
Students are matched with research labs within the NYU community and with industry partners to investigate pressing issues, applying data science to the following areas: Probability and statistical analyses Natural language processing Big Data analysis and modeling Machine learning and computational statistics Coding and software engineering Visualization modeling Neural networks Signal processing High dimensional statistics Capstone projects present students with the opportunity to work in their field of interest and gain exposure to applicable solutions. Project sponsors, NYU labs, and external partners, in turn receive the benefit of having a new perspective applied to their projects.
“Capstone is a unique opportunity for students to solve real world problems through projects carried out in collaboration with industry partners or research labs within the NYU community,” says capstone advisor and CDS Research Fellow Anastasios Noulas. “It is a vital experience for students ahead of their graduation and prior to entering the market, as it helps them improve their skills, especially in problem solving contexts that are atypical compared to standard courses offered in the curriculum. Cooperation within teams is another crucial skill built through the Capstone experience as projects are typically run across groups of 2 to 4 people.” The Capstone Project offers the opportunity for organizations to propose a project that our graduate students will work on as part of their curriculum for one semester. Information on the course along with a questionnaire to propose a project, can be found on the Capstone Fall 2023 Project Submission Form.
