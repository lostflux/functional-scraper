Construction Projects underway Control Building Future control room The Control Building is advancing. In the main ITER control room (43 m x 18 m), the large display screens will be installed on the left wall, while viewers will get a glimpse of how ITER's "brain" operates from the viewing gallery at the far end.
29 August 2023 Download Work moves inside The Control Building, which occupies one corner of the platform, can be seen at bottom left in this image. Civil works are complete and the work is moving inside.
16 March 2023 Download One night in December The top of the Control Building has a reflective surface like many of the other structures on the platform. It almost seems like we're looking at the Assembly Hall and its lower antechamber, the Cleaning Facility. On this December night, the (nearly) full moon stands out in the sky.
06 December 2022 Download Nice view The view from inside the Control Building, where certain areas have now been handed over to the ITER Organization for installation activities.
06 December 2022 Download Construction essentially completed The construction contract for the Control Building was signed between the European Domestic Agency Fusion for Energy and Demathieu Bard Construction (France) in 2019. A team of approximately 35 people on the ground brought the project to fruition.
06 December 2022 Download On track for structure completion The Control Building is progressing well on the north corner of the ITER site. Structural work, including exterior cladding, should be completed by the end of the year.
23 September 2022 Download Future home to operators The steel and concrete structural works for the Control Building are complete and the installation of exterior cladding is advancing well. The team is finalizing roofing, windows and doors and installing cable trays. The control room will be staffed 7 days a week, 24 hours a day, by 60-80 operators during the operational phases of the ITER machine.
08 September 2022 Download A different livery Contrary to most buildings on the ITER platform, clad in mirror-like stainless steel and grey-lacquered metal, the Control Buildingâ€”because of its unique role as command centreâ€”will be dressed in dark grey and undulating steel. (Illustration ENIA Architects) 11 July 2022 Download Progress on the main control room The future ITER control room, where up to 80 operators, researchers, and engineers will be responsible around the clock for the operation and control functions of the machine and plant. Â© Luca Zanier (https://www.zanier.ch/) 06 July 2022 Download First cladding ITER's brain centreâ€”the Control Buildingâ€”should be completed by the end of the year. Cladding work is underway.
14 June 2022 Download Future control room Looking southwest, with the Tokamak Complex in the background, this is the 43 m x 18 m main control room. Its steel structure is in place and roof cladding will soon be installed. The room will have a raised floor 70 centimetres above the present slab to accommodate the dense cabling that will transport power and data to the various control desks.
05 May 2022 Download Control centre rising Work is progressing on the 3,500-square metre, three-storey ITER Control Building. Scientists, engineers and operators will work from here to monitor machine operation and analyze the data they receive from each pulse.
05 May 2022 Download Future server room Smaller than the main control room, the main server room (30 m x 13 m) will also have a raised floor to house the cabling carrying large amounts of data to and from the numerous CODAC cubicles. Concrete works have been finalized in this area and waterproofing is ongoing on the roof slab in order to commence interior finishing work.
05 May 2022 Download Meeting room with a view On southeastern side of the building, a meeting room with large glazed openings will provide an unobstructed view of the Tokamak Complex and the heat rejection areaâ€”a nice change from the numbers and graphs on the operators' computer screens.
05 May 2022 Download Control Building, part two Work has started on the steel structure of the ITER Control Building.
21 February 2022 Download Control Building: 24-hour presence The Control Building, going up now on the ITER site, will be the daily work environment for the operators, researchers, and engineers running ITER physics experiments or the routine 24-hour operation and control functions of the machine and plant.
08 December 2021 Download News from the northern corner The Control Building is rising on the northern corner of the construction site. Also visible in the aerial shot: the solar panels that now cover the ITER staff parking lot.
01 December 2021 Download Command centre, from the air The Control Building is under construction in the bottom right corner of this image. ITER personnel will enter through the pedestrian footbridge that connects to Headquarters. Â© Les Nouveaux MÃ©dias/SNC ENGAGE 29 October 2021 Download Control Building, October 2021 Shot from the top of the cooling towers, this photo dated from 15 October 2021 shows the progress on the construction of the ITER Control Building.
15 October 2021 Download Control Building rising Between ITER Headquarters and the cooling towers (background), a new building project is underwayâ€”the (non-nuclear) Control Building, from which scientists, engineers and operators will follow every pulse. A smaller (nuclear) Control Building will be erected at a later date as an emergency fallback area.
27 September 2021 Download Starting on the Control Building Work has started on the site of the ITER Control Building. A tunnel (and bridge) connect the ITER Control Building with Headquarters.
30 April 2021 Download Exploration begins for Control Building Ground exploration is beginning for the Control Building construction project in the bottom right hand corner of this image. Photo: ITER Organization/EJF Riche 06 November 2020 Download Thoughtfully created The main ITER control room will be carefully designed to create an optimum working environmentâ€”with plenty of light and space, and a careful study of ergonomics. Â© Enia Architectes, France Download The non-nuclear control building Construction is underway now on the non-nuclear control building. A nuclear building will go up at a later date, between the main control room and the cooling towers visible in the background. Â© Enia Architectes, France Download The inner structure The building superstructure is made of four independent concrete blocks, separated by structural joints, and a network of steel reinforcement. It should be completed by summer 2022.
