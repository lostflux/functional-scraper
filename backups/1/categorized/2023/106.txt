ICLR is globally renowned for presenting and publishing cutting-edge research on all aspects of deep learning used in the fields of artificial intelligence, statistics and data science, as well as important application areas such as machine vision, computational biology, speech recognition, text understanding, gaming, and robotics.
ICLR is one of the fastest growing artificial intelligence conferences in the world. Participants at ICLR span a wide range of backgrounds, from academic and industrial researchers, to entrepreneurs and engineers, to graduate students and postdocs.
The rapidly developing field of deep learning is concerned with questions surrounding how we can best learn meaningful and useful representations of data. ICLR takes a broad view of the field and includes topics such as feature learning, metric learning, compositional modeling, structured prediction, reinforcement learning, and issues regarding large-scale learning and non-convex optimization.
A non-exhaustive list of relevant topics explored at the conference include: unsupervised, semi-supervised, and supervised representation learning representation learning for planning and reinforcement learning metric learning and kernel learning sparse coding and dimensionality expansion hierarchical models optimization for representation learning learning representations of outputs or states implementation issues, parallelization, software platforms, hardware applications in vision, audio, speech, natural language processing, robotics, neuroscience, or any other field ICLR uses cookies to remember that you are logged in.
