Plant assembly Home Assembly Overview Tokamak Assembly Plant Assembly Assembly Tooling Metrology Commissioning Plant Assembly $(document).ready(function(){ // Opening popup with dedicated list function openPop(width, list){ $('.inline-pop').colorbox({ iframe:true, opacity:0.8, href:"/ajax/www/popups/wd_700/lang_/urldepth_0/id_" + list, width: "65%", scrolling: false, }); } // definition popup $('a.definition').each(function() { var widthValue = $(this).data('width') + 'px'; $(this).qtip({ content: { text: function(event, api) { $.ajax({ url: api.elements.target.attr('data-source') // Use href attribute as URL }) .then(function(content) { // Set the tooltip content upon successful retrieval api.set('content.text', content); }, function(xhr, status, error) { // Upon failure... set the tooltip content to error api.set('content.text', status + ': ' + error); }); return 'Loading...'; // Set some initial text } }, position: { viewport: $(window), target: 'mouse' }, style: { classes: 'qtip-rounded qtip-wiki', // No additional classes added to .qtip element width: widthValue } }); }); }) Everything outside of the Tokamak boundary falls into the category of "plant assembly"â€”including the installation of equipment and systems inside of the Tokamak Complex (pictured above) as well as the more standard plant installation works in buildings across the ITER platform.
$(document).ready(function(){ // Opening popup with dedicated list function openPop(width, list){ $('.inline-pop').colorbox({ iframe:true, opacity:0.8, href:"/ajax/www/popups/wd_700/lang_/urldepth_0/id_" + list, width: "65%", scrolling: false, }); } // definition popup $('a.definition').each(function() { var widthValue = $(this).data('width') + 'px'; $(this).qtip({ content: { text: function(event, api) { $.ajax({ url: api.elements.target.attr('data-source') // Use href attribute as URL }) .then(function(content) { // Set the tooltip content upon successful retrieval api.set('content.text', content); }, function(xhr, status, error) { // Upon failure... set the tooltip content to error api.set('content.text', status + ': ' + error); }); return 'Loading...'; // Set some initial text } }, position: { viewport: $(window), target: 'mouse' }, style: { classes: 'qtip-rounded qtip-wiki', // No additional classes added to .qtip element width: widthValue } }); }); }) First-phase plant assembly contracts cover the systems needed for First Plasma. This category includes the cryogenic, cooling water and electrical plants; basic diagnostics; some electron cyclotron heating, as well as large captive components for second plasma that must be installed in the buildings early.
$(document).ready(function(){ // Opening popup with dedicated list function openPop(width, list){ $('.inline-pop').colorbox({ iframe:true, opacity:0.8, href:"/ajax/www/popups/wd_700/lang_/urldepth_0/id_" + list, width: "65%", scrolling: false, }); } // definition popup $('a.definition').each(function() { var widthValue = $(this).data('width') + 'px'; $(this).qtip({ content: { text: function(event, api) { $.ajax({ url: api.elements.target.attr('data-source') // Use href attribute as URL }) .then(function(content) { // Set the tooltip content upon successful retrieval api.set('content.text', content); }, function(xhr, status, error) { // Upon failure... set the tooltip content to error api.set('content.text', status + ': ' + error); }); return 'Loading...'; // Set some initial text } }, position: { viewport: $(window), target: 'mouse' }, style: { classes: 'qtip-rounded qtip-wiki', // No additional classes added to .qtip element width: widthValue } }); }); }) For the most complex and time-sensitive areaâ€”the Tokamak Complexâ€”the choice has been made to split the works between two contractors, and to organize the division of scope by system, location and sequence ( see detail below ). Although the two assembly contractors for the Tokamak Complex work in distinct areas, their work scope contains many common elements.
$(document).ready(function(){ // Opening popup with dedicated list function openPop(width, list){ $('.inline-pop').colorbox({ iframe:true, opacity:0.8, href:"/ajax/www/popups/wd_700/lang_/urldepth_0/id_" + list, width: "65%", scrolling: false, }); } // definition popup $('a.definition').each(function() { var widthValue = $(this).data('width') + 'px'; $(this).qtip({ content: { text: function(event, api) { $.ajax({ url: api.elements.target.attr('data-source') // Use href attribute as URL }) .then(function(content) { // Set the tooltip content upon successful retrieval api.set('content.text', content); }, function(xhr, status, error) { // Upon failure... set the tooltip content to error api.set('content.text', status + ': ' + error); }); return 'Loading...'; // Set some initial text } }, position: { viewport: $(window), target: 'mouse' }, style: { classes: 'qtip-rounded qtip-wiki', // No additional classes added to .qtip element width: widthValue } }); }); }) Mechanical and piping works: vessels, piping systems, heat exchangers, pumps, motors; cable trays and cable pulling; wave guides; piping thermal installation; pressure tests, flushing.
Electrical, instrumentation and control: DC busbars, switching equipment, power cables, I&C cables and cabinets.
$(document).ready(function(){ // Opening popup with dedicated list function openPop(width, list){ $('.inline-pop').colorbox({ iframe:true, opacity:0.8, href:"/ajax/www/popups/wd_700/lang_/urldepth_0/id_" + list, width: "65%", scrolling: false, }); } // definition popup $('a.definition').each(function() { var widthValue = $(this).data('width') + 'px'; $(this).qtip({ content: { text: function(event, api) { $.ajax({ url: api.elements.target.attr('data-source') // Use href attribute as URL }) .then(function(content) { // Set the tooltip content upon successful retrieval api.set('content.text', content); }, function(xhr, status, error) { // Upon failure... set the tooltip content to error api.set('content.text', status + ': ' + error); }); return 'Loading...'; // Set some initial text } }, position: { viewport: $(window), target: 'mouse' }, style: { classes: 'qtip-rounded qtip-wiki', // No additional classes added to .qtip element width: widthValue } }); }); }) Co-activity in the Tokamak Complex will be a challenge to manage, as ITER Organization assembly contractors work inside of congested areas alongside the European Domestic Agency contractors who are finishing the installation of building services such as HVAC, fire protection and electrical services. Also challenging are the installation tolerances, the large number of components and the tight schedule.
$(document).ready(function(){ // Opening popup with dedicated list function openPop(width, list){ $('.inline-pop').colorbox({ iframe:true, opacity:0.8, href:"/ajax/www/popups/wd_700/lang_/urldepth_0/id_" + list, width: "65%", scrolling: false, }); } // definition popup $('a.definition').each(function() { var widthValue = $(this).data('width') + 'px'; $(this).qtip({ content: { text: function(event, api) { $.ajax({ url: api.elements.target.attr('data-source') // Use href attribute as URL }) .then(function(content) { // Set the tooltip content upon successful retrieval api.set('content.text', content); }, function(xhr, status, error) { // Upon failure... set the tooltip content to error api.set('content.text', status + ': ' + error); }); return 'Loading...'; // Set some initial text } }, position: { viewport: $(window), target: 'mouse' }, style: { classes: 'qtip-rounded qtip-wiki', // No additional classes added to .qtip element width: widthValue } }); }); }) The installation of equipment is progressing in the Tokamak Complex in areas that have been handed over as completed by the European Domestic Agency (beginning with the basement levels and moving up). Work to install systems is also underway in plant buildings across the ITER platform; others have been fully equipped and turned over to the ITER Organization for commissioning.

With a core team of about 80 people chosen from the ITER Organization, the European Domestic Agency buildings team, contractors, suppliers, and the Domestic Agencies, the HIT works in a step-by-step way to assess all available system design elements for completeness, consistency and constructability.

Inserted into a wall opening, the spool will connect the cryolines installed inside the building to those coming from the cryoplant along the elevated ''cryobridge.'' 17 October 2022 Download Manual alignment Whatever the size or weight of a cryoline spool, the most delicate sequences of final alignment are done manually. Here, an operator delicately guides the 5.5-tonne spool into the wall opening, whose diameter is only a few millimetres larger than that of the component.
17 October 2022 Download Heavy duty "shape sorter" At level 3 (L3) of the Tokamak Building, the teams are ready to play a heavy-duty version of "Shape Sorter": the cylindrical object to introduce in the circular opening measures 8 metres in length, 1 metre in diameter and weighs 5.5 tonnes.
17 October 2022 Download Not just pipes Procured by India, manufactured by INOX-CVA in India and Air Liquide in France, cryolines are more than just pipes: they are high-tech, vacuum-insulated components that, for the most complex of them, host several multi-process pipes transporting different cooling fluids in and out of the ITER Tokamak.
17 October 2022 Download Diagnostics: installing captive components now Support elements for diagnostic pipes, cables and lines are received at the workshop of the installation contractor on the ITER site, before they are assembled and installed in the Tokamak Complex. Any captive components (soon to be boxed in by other systems or components) must be installed now.
31 March 2022 Download Early installation for optical diagnostics Recently installed diagnostics supports at the L1 level of the Tokamak Building, showing some of the detail of how the supports are bolted to the ceiling by first welding threaded studs to steel plates embedded in the ceiling concrete.

25 November 2021 Download 5,000 tonnes of equipment As tall as a seven-storey building and covering the equivalent of two soccer fields, the ITER cryoplant is located south of the Tokamak Complex. The largest single-unit cryogenic installation in the world, it is tasked with a daunting mission: to provide cooling fluids to 10,000 tonnes of superconducting magnets, eight massive cryopumps, and thousands of square metres of thermal shielding. Approximately 5,000 tonnes of equipment have been installed and commissioning is about to start.
25 November 2021 Download Cryoplant, from above Despite being water cooled, the large power machines inside the cryoplant will dissipate considerable amounts of heat (on the order of 20 MW). HVAC ducts on the building's roof are tasked with extracting it. The yellow elements at the top of this drone photograph are busbars feeding electrical power to the installation.

25 September 2021 Download Just tall enough This L3 gallery is just tall enough to permit the handling, by telescopic spider crane, of the 1.5-tonne, 11-metre-long spool. On 16 June it is inserted into the narrow ''south shaft'' connecting L3 to B2, which is designed to host this cryoline plus one other.
16 June 2021 Download Vertical "Vertical cryolines" will connect the cryoline network in the basement (B2 level) with those on level L3. A first vertical spool is installed in the south shaft at L3 on 16 June.
16 June 2021 Download Building the feeders, segment by segment This cryostat feedthrough is one of two feeder components introduced into the basement of the Tokamak Complex on 14 April. Called the STR3 feedthrough, it will supply supercritical helium at 4.5 K to the toroidal field coil cases and other coil structures (central solenoid, correction coils).
14 April 2021 Download Just large enough This opening in the Tritium Building is just large enough for feeder elements to pass. This one (the coil termination box for poloidal coil #4 ) is 17 metres long.
14 April 2021 Download Down the alley A large cryoline spool, with several process pipes inside its metal case, is transported along the cryoplant to be installed through the roof of the far end, near the Tokamak Building.
25 March 2021 Download Delivers helium The largest of the two spools installed on Thursday 25 March was 12 metres long, 1 metre in diameter and weighed 6 tonnes. It is tasked with delivering supercritical helium at 4.7 K (minus 269 Â°C) to the magnets.
25 March 2021 Download Carefully The cryoline spools are delicate pieces of high technology that can only tolerate a certain level of acceleration during transport and lift. Shock recorders allowed operators to control every step of the process.
25 March 2021 Download Through the roof A massive steel structure supports the 6-tonne component that has come through the roof. It needs to be precisely aligned with the connections on top of the cryoplant's termination cold box.
25 March 2021 Download Dark grey elements The two elements in dark grey have now been installed. At the bottom, they connect to the cryoplant's termination cold box (which acts as a dispenser of cooling fluids). At the top, other spools will connect to carry the cooling fluids across a bridge to the Tokamak Building.
