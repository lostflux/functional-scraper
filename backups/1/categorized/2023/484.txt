HKIA develops digital twin Alita Sharon October 3, 2019 Share via Facebook Like Twitter Pinterest LinkedIn Digg Del Tumblr VKontakte Print Email Reddit Buffer Love This Weibo Pocket Xing Odnoklassniki WhatsApp Meneame Blogger Amazon Yahoo Mail Gmail AOL Newsvine HackerNews Evernote MySpace Mail.ru Viadeo Line Flipboard Comments Yummly SMS Viber Telegram Subscribe Skype Facebook Messenger Kakao LiveJournal Yammer Edgar Fintel Mix Instapaper Copy Link Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) is working to become a smart airport by applying innovation and technology to create an enjoyable and hassle-free experience for passengers, as well as enhance operational efficiency. A part of this vision is the creation of a digital twin of HKIA.
The digital twin is a virtual 3D model in which data from different sources can be integrated, made available instantly, visualized in a human-centric interface and analysed to make predictions in an explainable way.
Digital twins are also constructed for new construction projects to provide a lifelike look of the design and amenities to facilitate better planning and design adjustments.
The creation of HKIA’s digital twin first started with the BIMs of HKIA linked with various operation data from the airport’s asset management system, which is integrated with a geographical information systems (GIS) map to create the static state of the digital twin.
A unity engine – a development platform designed to integrate and create 3D models also used in video games and architecture – is then deployed to navigate the 3D model of the airport in a photo-realistic manner.
To make the digital twin come alive, the model is fed with real-time data from IoT devices deployed throughout the airport. This is coupled with simulation tools, corporate applications and an enterprise analytics platform. This way, HKIA can literally predict what the airport will experience in the future.
The virtual model has been completed for the areas of Terminal 1 that are accessible by passengers, while remaining areas of the airport will be added to the replica in stages.
The digital twin’s lifelike visualization helps the airport authority streamline the design review for new construction projects, especially for off-site construction methods that require more precise planning.
Moreover, using predictive analytics, the digital twin can provide maintenance alerts that are useful in effective resources deployment, resulting in cost savings and improved services.
The supplier perspective HKIA and a Vietnamese company worked closely together on the development of the airport’s digital strategy for deploying a digital twin at the main terminal.
The company’s goal is for digital twin technology to start making recommendations based on what the data shows will happen. The airport can then set its own rules about how those recommendations are actioned. Some will be handled automatically, while other decisions will always need human input, particularly during times of heavy disruption.
Ultimately recommendations made by digital twin technology will help inform that decision-making. The technology will learn which recommendations are typically accepted and suggest a new rule to make the process even more efficient.
A fully functioning digital twin of an airport is still some time off. However, as experts work to build it out more widely and deeply, the full extent of its potential is becoming clear.
Advice for those looking to develop digital twins Airport owners must identify the end-user and the intended use of the digital twin. They should also know what problem they are attempting to solve. This will lead to what types of maps, models, drawings and engineering data should be collected and how it should be presented.
The key is to engage all key stakeholders within the airport to see how they use the data. Establish standards and protocols for model management and updating. Future-proof the data in the model and do not rely on proprietary software; the airport will be around long after the software.
Upskill staff in the use of manipulation of the data and models. This will need a step-change in terms of people, process and technology. If unsure, seek professional help to map out a strategic roadmap for the digital transformation of the airport prior to deploying a digital twin.
There is significant potential in digital twin technology and it is certainly something all airports should be looking at. However, a digital twin of an airport can only be truly effective if every available piece of data is used, making it important to ensure there is buy-in from all stakeholders involved in running the airport.
Share on LinkedIn Share on Facebook Singapore: Revolutionising Metal 3D Printing Yen Ocampo November 1, 2023 Share via Facebook Like Twitter Pinterest LinkedIn Digg Del Tumblr VKontakte Print Email Reddit Buffer Love This Weibo Pocket Xing Odnoklassniki WhatsApp Meneame Blogger Amazon Yahoo Mail Gmail AOL Newsvine HackerNews Evernote MySpace Mail.ru Viadeo Line Flipboard Comments Yummly SMS Viber Telegram Subscribe Skype Facebook Messenger Kakao LiveJournal Yammer Edgar Fintel Mix Instapaper Copy Link A groundbreaking development in the field of 3D printing has emerged, offering the potential for 3D-printed metal components with distinct and contrasting properties is spearheaded by Nanyang Technological University, Singapore (NTU Singapore) and the University of Cambridge, promises to reshape the manufacturing landscape by eliminating the need for additional raw materials, mechanical treatments, or complex machining processes.
Instead, this new method leverages the principles of materials science and mechanical engineering, in tandem with 3D printing techniques, to alter the microscopic structures of metals, thus modifying their properties.
Traditionally, the concept of altering metal properties often conjures images of blacksmiths hammering and reshaping metals to enhance their strength. However, this age-old method isn’t suited for complex 3D-printed structures. Dr Gao Shubo, a research fellow at NTU’s School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, embarked on a journey to find an innovative way to adjust the microstructures of 3D-printed metals without resorting to traditional “beating.” Dr Gao’s solution lies in harnessing the unique capabilities of 3D printing. By adjusting the energy source, typically a laser beam, during the printing process, it became possible to melt layers of metal powder in specific ways.
This controlled the formation of gaps in the metal, but the real breakthrough lay in how this affected the metal’s microstructures. The researchers found that by altering the laser parameters, they could create distinct microstructures within the same metal part, some of which enhanced its strength while others made it mechanically weaker.
What sets this method apart is the ability to fine-tune the characteristics of each 3D-printed metal at different points within the structure. This level of precision is unattainable with conventional manufacturing processes, offering manufacturers the exciting prospect of designing intricate components with tailored properties. For instance, a single metal part can exhibit contrasting properties in different regions, catering to a wide range of applications.
Remarkably, the research team discovered that 3D-printed metals with both strong and weak regions displayed a synergistic interaction, resulting in slightly greater strength than metals with uniformly strong regions. This revelation has the potential to challenge conventional wisdom, potentially leading to the creation of stronger and tougher materials that defy classical theories governing composite materials.
Additionally, the researchers believe that this method can be applied to produce 3D-printed metals with varying functional properties. For instance, a metal component could be designed to exhibit increased corrosion resistance in submerged sections while being less corrosion-resistant in parts exposed to the atmosphere. The possibilities appear limitless, and future endeavours may involve exploring new microstructure designs that further enhance mechanical and functional properties.
This groundbreaking approach marks a significant milestone in the realm of 3D printing. Not only does it open doors to a new era of manufacturing efficiency by reducing costs and simplifying the production process, but it also ushers in a wave of customisation previously unattainable in the world of metals.
The ability to fine-tune a metal’s properties at a microscopic level will undoubtedly lead to innovative and groundbreaking applications across various industries. As technology continues to advance, the future of 3D-printed metals appears to be filled with endless opportunities for creativity and innovation.
The two universities believe that 3D printing may serve as a bridge between the digital and physical worlds and that its integration into the digital economy is changing how things are developed, manufactured, and consumed. It mirrors the digital economy’s broader shift toward more nimble, personalised, and data-driven techniques.
