Metrology Home Assembly Overview Tokamak Assembly Plant Assembly Assembly Tooling Metrology Commissioning Metrology $(document).ready(function(){ // Opening popup with dedicated list function openPop(width, list){ $('.inline-pop').colorbox({ iframe:true, opacity:0.8, href:"/ajax/www/popups/wd_700/lang_/urldepth_0/id_" + list, width: "65%", scrolling: false, }); } // definition popup $('a.definition').each(function() { var widthValue = $(this).data('width') + 'px'; $(this).qtip({ content: { text: function(event, api) { $.ajax({ url: api.elements.target.attr('data-source') // Use href attribute as URL }) .then(function(content) { // Set the tooltip content upon successful retrieval api.set('content.text', content); }, function(xhr, status, error) { // Upon failure... set the tooltip content to error api.set('content.text', status + ': ' + error); }); return 'Loading...'; // Set some initial text } }, position: { viewport: $(window), target: 'mouse' }, style: { classes: 'qtip-rounded qtip-wiki', // No additional classes added to .qtip element width: widthValue } }); }); }) Controlling the geometry of the machine during the assembly process will be a very demanding activity that can only be achieved by managing variation at each stage. Accurate dimensional control will ensure that the exacting tolerances required for machine operation are achieved, and by the end of the process metrologists will have recorded the exact as-built geometry of the machineâ€”an invaluable source of information for future maintenance, modifications or revision.
$(document).ready(function(){ // Opening popup with dedicated list function openPop(width, list){ $('.inline-pop').colorbox({ iframe:true, opacity:0.8, href:"/ajax/www/popups/wd_700/lang_/urldepth_0/id_" + list, width: "65%", scrolling: false, }); } // definition popup $('a.definition').each(function() { var widthValue = $(this).data('width') + 'px'; $(this).qtip({ content: { text: function(event, api) { $.ajax({ url: api.elements.target.attr('data-source') // Use href attribute as URL }) .then(function(content) { // Set the tooltip content upon successful retrieval api.set('content.text', content); }, function(xhr, status, error) { // Upon failure... set the tooltip content to error api.set('content.text', status + ': ' + error); }); return 'Loading...'; // Set some initial text } }, position: { viewport: $(window), target: 'mouse' }, style: { classes: 'qtip-rounded qtip-wiki', // No additional classes added to .qtip element width: widthValue } }); }); }) All measurement tasks require a fixed reference base (or datum) from which measurements can be made and calculated. For large-volume metrology applications, the reference base typically takes the form of a survey network that consists of a collection of target "nests" and/or instrument stations that have known geometry and computed uncertainty.

The accuracy requirements for each network vary according to the alignment tasks for which they are designed.

$(document).ready(function(){ // Opening popup with dedicated list function openPop(width, list){ $('.inline-pop').colorbox({ iframe:true, opacity:0.8, href:"/ajax/www/popups/wd_700/lang_/urldepth_0/id_" + list, width: "65%", scrolling: false, }); } // definition popup $('a.definition').each(function() { var widthValue = $(this).data('width') + 'px'; $(this).qtip({ content: { text: function(event, api) { $.ajax({ url: api.elements.target.attr('data-source') // Use href attribute as URL }) .then(function(content) { // Set the tooltip content upon successful retrieval api.set('content.text', content); }, function(xhr, status, error) { // Upon failure... set the tooltip content to error api.set('content.text', status + ': ' + error); }); return 'Loading...'; // Set some initial text } }, position: { viewport: $(window), target: 'mouse' }, style: { classes: 'qtip-rounded qtip-wiki', // No additional classes added to .qtip element width: widthValue } }); }); }) Optimization algorithms will be used to achieve the best possible configuration for machine operation by analyzing "as-built" geometry at each stage of the assembly and by modifying the alignment criteria to suit. This is especially important when defining the as-built magnetic axis of the machine and the subsequent alignment of components against this.

This is critical for the successful operation of the ITER machine.

Metrology accompanied the operation, from rehearsal to the component's final arrival in the pit.

It is based on 11 geodetic pillars that have been measured in relation to one another and to a wider GPS system, and which now provide a fixed reference base (or datum) from which more localized measurements can be made and calculated.

Metrologists will be able to access the overall coordinate system from any location by measuring a small number of local reference points. The accuracy of the network has been measured within a global uncertainty range of 0.2 to 0.4 mm, allowing installation contractors to align components to sub-millimetre accuracy.

As the pit becomes more crowded and lower pit wall targets are progressively hidden from view, targets in the port cell galleries will maintain lines of sight and play an important role in measurement tasks.

The cryostat base will be aligned using the target nests of the Tokamak Pit Network; the toroidal field coils and cryostat lower cylinder will be aligned in relation to the as-built position of the cryostat base; and the coordinate frame of the 18 toroidal field coils will serve as reference for the final alignment of the vacuum vessel, the remaining magnet systems and the in-vessel components.

Manufactured in plants around the world and shipped to ITER, several thousand components must be customized during assembly to achieve the demanding tolerances allocated to in-vessel systems. As a single example, the assembly of the blanket modules inside the vessel requires a survey of approximately 4,400 components; each one needs to be individually customized to deliver the required alignment.
