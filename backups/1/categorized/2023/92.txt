13 September 2023 Download Protected in pink Eighteen supports for the toroidal field magnets are protected in pink plastic. Just inside the circle formed by the supports is poloidal field magnet #5.
07 September 2023 Download Central solenoid: now a two-module stack Lifted by a bespoke tool exercising pressure through radial compression, a second 110-tonne central solenoid module is positioned on the assembly platform above the first. (A third waits its turn on the left.) 05 September 2023 Download Pin-point precision It takes a whole range of tools to position the 110-tonne component with the required precision: once cranes and ''synch hoists'' have done the heavy job, a complex system of subtle adjustment devices allows micrometric movements in pitch, roll and spin.
05 September 2023 Download Small adjustments Stacking cylindrical devices and connecting their fragile electrical and cryogenics leads demands a particular attention to concentricity and straightness.
05 September 2023 Download Thermal shield repair/replacement contracts signed For vacuum vessel thermal shield sectors showing no sign of stress corrosion cracking, the panels can be repaired. The initial scope of the repair contract is for two sector sets to be disassembled at ITER, repaired at the contractor's premises, and returned. For thermal shield sectors already compromised by damage, complete re-fabrication is necessary. See news about thermal shield repair/replacement contracts here: https://www.iter.org/newsline/-/3914 30 August 2023 Download Thermal shield: metrology underway Metrology is underway on outboard segments of thermal shield at one end of the Poloidal Field Coils Winding Facility on site.
30 August 2023 Download Recording as-built dimensions This segment of thermal shield must be dismantled into four individual panels. Before that takes place, teams of metrologists record all of its as-built dimensions.
30 August 2023 Download Sector module #8 Vacuum vessel sector #8, seen here in a horizontal position on the upending tool, was removed from vertical tooling when it became evident that sector #6 (already in the pit) would need to be removed and repaired alongside sector #7. Sector #8 will be repaired horizontally in the former Cryostat Workshop.
29 August 2023 Download Things in reverse The "upending tool" had to turn into a "downending tool" in order to remove sector #8 from the sector sub-assembly tool where it had been positioned. This unplanned for operation required study and measurements.
29 August 2023 Download New buildings emerge The concrete facade of the Tokamak Complex is now obscured by the High Voltage Building for neutral beam power supply (black, centre). Other fast-evolving features on the platform include the structure of a new bridge for the transfer of electrical power to the magnets (right) and the low-voltage Neutral Beam Power Supply Building (left).
29 August 2023 Download Future control room The Control Building is advancing. In the main ITER control room (43 m x 18 m), the large display screens will be installed on the left wall, while viewers will get a glimpse of how ITER's "brain" operates from the viewing gallery at the far end.
29 August 2023 Download New bridges In addition to the cryobridge (foreground, for the distribution of cryogenic lines) there are now two other bridges spanning the main boulevard of the platform They are busbar bridges, for the transport of electrical busbars from the Magnet Power Conversion buildings to the Tokamak Complex.
29 August 2023 Download Inside the cryobridge In order to connect the cryolines coming from the cryoplant to those already installed in the Tokamak Building, the cryobridge runs for 130 metres, first crossing the boulevard and then making a sharp left turn to run along the Assembly Hall. This employee is inside the cryobridge, walking towards the cryoplant.
29 August 2023 Download Late summer 2023 With cladding, the two buildings for neutral beam power supplies (centre and left of centre) are looking close to finalized. In between them is a technical area designed to house 10 high voltage transformers.
29 August 2023 Download Late August Despite the heat waves of July and August, progress made over the summer is observable in every corner of the ITER platform. The last major addition to the construction platform will be the Hot Cell Facility, a large building will go up where the two cranes are standing, at left.
29 August 2023 Download Tritum Building: end of civil works Civil works on the seven-storey concrete Tritium Building are nearly complete and the tall cranes will soon be dismantled. Teams are working on the last level, L5, to complete all kinds of finishing works, including waterproofing.
29 August 2023 Download Game of comparison Comparing this latest general view with the one taken in January 2023 permits us to measure the progress accomplished.
29 August 2023 Download Disassembly works Disassembly of sector module #7 is well advanced; thermal shield panels have been removed and toroidal field coils have been dissociated. In this striking view taken from under the tool, the sector's "underbelly" is clearly visible, as are the toroidal field coils on either side in the tool "wings." 29 August 2023 Download Same tool, different operation The assembly of sector module #7 was almost finalized when the decision to stop the process and to dismantle was taken at the end of 2022. The reverse operationâ€”the disassembly of the different elements making up a sectorâ€”is underway to prepare for repair work. (https://www.iter.org/newsline/-/3882 29 August 2023 Download Next cylindrical magnet in line This cylindrical, 110-tonne central solenoid magnet, delivered by the United States Domestic Agency, has been unwrapped to prepare for its installation on the dedicated assembly platform in the right corner of the photo.
29 August 2023 Download Disassembling sector #7 To prepare for the repair of the bevel region of vacuum vessel sector #7, the two toroidal field magnets have been removed from the sector into the wings of the tool.
29 August 2023 Download PF4 moved to storage On 8 August, poloidal field coil #4 (24 metres in diameter, 350 tonnes) is moved from the European Poloidal Field Coils Winding Facility to storage on site. Only one coil, PF3, remains to be completed by Europe.
08 August 2023 Download Preparing for the Scientific Data and Computer Centre Cooling and electrical equipment has been installed outside of Headquarters for the ITER Scientific Data and Computer Centre.

Only one more coil remains to be finalized: PF3.
07 July 2023 Download Into tool The last leg of the reverse operation for sector module #6: after removal from the Tokamak pit, the component is lowered into one of the twin sector sub-assembly tools to be disassembled and prepared for repair.
05 July 2023 Download Reverse operation Lessons learned during the May 2022 installation of the sector module were essential to the reverse operation. So too was the fact that the same team was on deck... (Photo Kenichi Ueno, ITER) 05 July 2023 Download Rotating The load has now passed the wall and will be rotated 90 degrees to face the sector sub-assembly tool closest to the wall.
05 July 2023 Download Carefully now One of the most delicate passages: the toroidal field coil termination boxes (wrapped in protective pink plastic) are the most sensitive and delicate parts of the assembly. When passing the wall that separates the assembly pit from the Assembly Hall, the vertical clearance is less than 20 centimetres.
05 July 2023 Download Back towards the Assembly Hall Sector module #6 follows the same path out of the assembly pit as it did 15 months ago on its way in.
05 July 2023 Download Watching the weight The load supported by each of the four crane hooks is displayed in real time on small screens, so the math is easily done: the module weighs slightly in excess of 1,350 tonnes.
05 July 2023 Download Step by step From detaching the module from its moorings in the assembly pit to lifting and transporting it to the sub-assembly tool, more than one hundred different steps had to be defined, validated and integrated into the lift procedure.
05 July 2023 Download A few centimetres At its narrowest, the clearance between the module and the central column does not exceed a few centimetres. The lift is paused at regular intervals to slow the swinging effect.
05 July 2023 Download Eagle eyes Although the lift operation relied heavily on sensors and strategically positioned cameras, "spotters" played a crucial role in overall safety and precision.
05 July 2023 Download Sector module #6 removed Sector module #6 (1,350 tonnes) is removed from the Tokamak pit on 5 July 2023. See: https://www.iter.org/newsline/-/3904 05 July 2023 Download Back in tooling In order to carry out this reverse operationâ€”sector module #6 from the Tokamak pit and re-placing it in tooling in the Assembly Hallâ€”metrologists were part of the preparation and execution teams.
05 July 2023 Download Final instrument checks "A lift-off is not exactly the reverse of a landing," says Daniel Coelho, the ITER assembly engineer who will coordinate the lift operation. Procedures have had to be adapted and additional guiding systems have had to be manufactured and installed.
04 July 2023 Download Planning removal The paperwork is done. Every tool and system has been checked. A "functional briefing" has reminded everyone involved of how the operation will proceed and clarified the chain of command. This week, the delicate and complex "extraction" of vacuum vessel sector module #6 from the assembly pit (in the background) will take place.
03 July 2023 Download Reverse lift imminent Late June, technicians were busy preparing sector module #6 for removal from the pit.
28 June 2023 Download June 2023 The ITER machine assembly pit, in late June 2023. (At the base of the column, a worker with a blue hard hat provides a sense of scale.) 28 June 2023 Download A window into the Tokamak pit On Saturday 24 June, Open Doors Day groups are taken through a port cell to the edge of the Tokamak pit. They are among the last people to see sector module #6 in place in the pit, since it is scheduled for removal (within days) for repair.
24 June 2023 Download Sector tools In the background, vacuum vessel sector #7 is suspended in tooling, and its two D-shaped toroidal field coils have been removed to the wings. The second tool, further to the back of the Hall, awaits sector module #6 from the machine pit.
24 June 2023 Download Overhead The completed cryobridge is 13 metres above the platform. Two other bridges along this road will house electrical busbars (one can be seen in construction in the background).
20 June 2023 Download Diagnostic port plugs: 1st units near completion Part of 23 vacuum vessel ports, " diagnostic port plug structures" will house diagnostics, integrated services, and other hardware. Two types are planned and the first units are coming off line. More at: https://www.iter.org/newsline/-/3894.
19 June 2023 Download Extra support from below A temporary propping system is in place to support the central column tool (in the centre of the Tokamak pit) during machine assembly. These propping elements have been installed under the concrete slab of the Tokamak Complex, directly under the machine. Read all about it here: https://www.iter.org/newsline/-/3886 01 June 2023 Download Under the Tokamak Complex Underneath the concrete slab that supports the Tokamak Complex is a vast, dimly lit space whose only features are squat, pillar-like structures called "plinths." Sandwiched between the top of the pillars and the slab above, flexible seismic pads ensure that in the event of an earthquake, the integrity of the building will be protected from sudden and strong horizontal accelerations.
01 June 2023 Download Highlighting the imporance of vacuum systems The ITER vacuum team organizes regular workshops to highlight the criticality of vacuum standards and quality with technical responsible officers, quality assurance specialists, and resident inspectors working at ITER and in the Domestic Agencies.
31 May 2023 Download ITER has a new test facility installed in one of the Magnet Power Conversion buildings to test how electronics react to magnetic fields.

15 May 2023 Download Preparing for repair work The same tools that were used for assembling the vacuum vessel sector modules from 1 sector, 2 toroidal field coils and thermal shield panels, is now being used for disassembly. In this photo, two toroidal field coils are temporarily held after disassembly on the wings of vertical tool SSAT-2.
11 May 2023 Download Beginning to re-centralize control stations Since 2018, small control rooms around the site have been established to support local testing and commissioning of plant equipment. With the opening of the temporary main control room (T-MCR) in late 2022 (https://www.iter.org/newsline/-/3845), some of these distributed functions are being brough back in and centralized (https://www.iter.org/newsline/-/3880).
09 May 2023 Download Musical chairs The view inside the Assembly Hall now gives a clear indication of what will happen soon: to the left sector #7 stands in the tall assembly tool SSAT-1, ready for repairs once the outboard thermal shield panel is removed. To the right, sector #8 is solidly attached to the upending tool, waiting to be moved from vertical to horizontal and transported to another building.
08 May 2023 Download Cold test ends The cold test of poloidal field coil #4 (PF4) has ended. Stay tuned for the lifting of the lid of the cryogenic chamber.
06 May 2023 Download Sturdy yet flexible Cryogenic process lines will be sheltered in this cryobridge, designed to withstand 200 tonnes of dead load and the "pushing and pulling" of the lines.
04 May 2023 Download Bridge with an angle A covered bridge runs 70 metres from the cryoplant to the Assembly Hall, before abruptly turning left at a 90-degree angle to run parallel to the Assembly Hall for another 60 metres in order to reach the Tokamak Complex. Its purpose? To carry gas and liquid helium to "clients" (superconducting magnets, thermal shield, cryopumps).
04 May 2023 Download Coordination is the key Success was achieved through the close collaboration the ITER Organization, global logistics provider DAHER, and transport platform operator Mammoet. The company Cegelec played an important role in designing systems and processes to synchronize the movements of the six individual transport platforms, and risk manager Apave was responsible for the overall safety of the transfer.
06 April 2023 Download 900 tonnes of dead weight A heavy duty, 50-centimetre-thick reinforced slab was recently constructed to accommodate the combined load of the top lid, support frame and transport platforms in the last phase of the operation. At approximately 900 tonnes, their total weight is equivalent to that of three Airbus A380s.
06 April 2023 Download An unusual vision On its way to the storage location, some 50 metres away from the Cryostat Workshop, the flying saucer-shaped component passes the Cleaning Facility and adjacent Assembly Hall, whose architectural design add a futuristic touch to the scene.
06 April 2023 Download Huge As it sat at the far end of the Cryostat Workshop, the top lid certainly felt like a large component. But as it slowly came out of the building amidst the roar of the power packs, it seemed to have dramatically grown in size. The 30-metre-in-diameter, 10-metre-tall load dwarfed everything around it.
06 April 2023 Download 6 self-propelled modular transporters Six self-propelled modular transport platforms, each equipped with a 500 HP power pack, worked in unison to move the cryostat top lid (665 tonnes) and its massive support frame.
06 April 2023 Download Team huddle Coordination and anticipation are key for a successful, smooth and safe operation. As the transport trailer power packs warm up, a last briefing brings together the operators and responsible officers from the dozen companies and organizations involved in the top lid transfer.
06 April 2023 Download Winding facility: progressive handover begins As poloidal field coil manufacturing activities wind down, the European Domestic Agency is progressively handing over the building to the ITER Organization, which will use the space for assembly activities. On 3 April, approximately 25% of the shop floor was officially transferred.
