We were very impressed by the quality of these proposals and thrilled to be able to include some of them as part of the ICLR program. We received 45 total submissions and accepted 19 workshops.
We also want to thank our team of reviewers, ICLR program committee and ICLR 2021 Workshop Chairs for their kind support.
The workshops will be held virtually (like the rest of the conference) in April 2022.
Selection Process Ultimately we could not accept every proposal but we worked to balance a few goals. We wanted to have a good representation of theory, applications and innovative multidisciplinary workshops to broaden the ICLR community. Additionally, as we have a single day for workshops, we wanted each workshop to be able to attract a good number of attendees, hence we tried to avoid having workshops with very similar topics.
A team of invited volunteer reviewers reviewed each workshop proposal which was an important part of the selection process. We strived to have a good balance between topics and took into account the diversity of the speakers and organising team across multiple factors such as gender, institution, seniority and geographic location.
We will not be releasing the reviews directly, but will be making available short meta-reviews on CMT to summarise the feedback, highlighting the strengths and opportunities for improvement.
We are looking forward to all your contributions to the workshops!
