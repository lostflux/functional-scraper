Lenders, money managers, and analysts‚Äîany jobs that involve crunching numbers to estimate a return‚Äîare at risk.
‚ÄúBanks have the curse of the baggage they have, like Kodak letting go of film,‚Äù Lee says. ‚ÄúTheir DNA is all wrong.‚Äù Lee‚Äôs VC firm, Sinovation Ventures, has started to invest in this space by financing Smart Finance Group, a company which algorithmically determines eligibility for payday loans. Lee expects the company‚Äôs algorithms to pay out 30 million loans this year, giving the company scale that would never have been achievable when hiring humans to do the same job. That core technology would be easily applicable to other kinds of loans and financial decisions.
As for the big banks that dominate now, the venture capitalist predicts they will be outmaneuvered by smaller startups able to deploy new technology much faster.
Lee has so much trust in AI‚Äôs financial prowess that he‚Äôs testing three algorithmic trading systems for his own wealth, which trade currencies, arbitrage, and a portfolio of its own choosing.
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt trade with humans anymore,‚Äù Lee tells Quartz.
His gamble has paid off: Lee reports that these systems have given an 8x return over his human personal banker, in an interview today with Quartz editor-in-chief Kevin Delaney.
But where small startups might have the ability to deploy their AI systems quickly, large financial institutions have the ability to work at a much larger scale and offer much more appealing compensation packages to computer science talent. JPMorgan has assigned 9% of its revenue this year to technology development, reports Bloomberg , channelling massive resources to hire and develop financial artificial intelligence systems.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre willing to invest to stay ahead of the curve, even if in the final analysis some of that money will go to product or a service that wasn‚Äôt needed,‚Äù JPMorgan CFO Marianne Lake told a conference audience last summer.
