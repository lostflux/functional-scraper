Strengthening African Machine Learning Support Africa’s community in AI to be owners and shapers of the advanced in technology and artificial intelligence. We do this by building communities, creating leadership, and recognising excellence in the development of machine learning and artificial intelligence across Africa.
Due to Covid-19, there will be no continent-wide Deep Learning Indaba in 2021. It was decided not to host a virtual event, as challenges around internet connectivity in some parts of Africa means we would unintentionally exclude too many participants that we would like to include. We’re hoping to host a massive, crazy, creative, colourful reunion in 2022! In the meantime, there are IndabaX events happening in 24 countries this year! Have a look at the wealth of collaborative activity near you.
