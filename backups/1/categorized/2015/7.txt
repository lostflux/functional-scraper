These sunshades will provide protection from the sun on the northwest facade of the building and reduce the need for cooling within. Made of highly resistant fibre concrete, the 3,104 sunshades will also provide structural strength. Photo: Ricciotti Download Architect's View #2 The underground auditorium of the ITER Headquarters will have a "green roof"â€”a natural way to regulate the temperature in the building. Photo: Ricciotti Download Architect's view #1 Two- to three-storey interior patiosâ€”spaced evenly along the central walkways of the building and planted with vegetationâ€”will generate ventilation, let in natural light, and provide a convivial setting for common areas.
