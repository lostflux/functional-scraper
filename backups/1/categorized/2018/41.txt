However, the environmental factors that control emission pathways and their sources are unclear; this complicates upscaling, forecasting and climate-impact-assessment efforts. Here we show that current whole-lake CH 4 and CO 2 emissions from widespread lakes in Arctic Alaska primarily originate from organic matter fixed within the past 3–4 millennia (modern to 3,300 ± 70 years before the present), and not from Pleistocene permafrost C. Furthermore, almost 100% of the annual diffusive C flux is emitted as CO 2.
 Although the lakes mostly processed younger C (89 ± 3% of total C emissions), minor contributions from ancient C sources were two times greater in fine-textured versus coarse-textured Pleistocene sediments, which emphasizes the importance of the underlying geological substrate in current and future emissions. This spatially extensive survey considered the environmental and temporal variability necessary to monitor and forecast the fate of ancient permafrost C as Arctic warming progresses.

 Current CH 4 emission estimates from Arctic lakes vary by a factor of two (11.9–24.2 Tg CH 4 yr −1 ) (refs 4 , 5 , 6 ), and future estimates from all permafrost-region sources span three orders of magnitude 7.
 Discrepancies persist because of uncertain climate projections 8 and because current lake-C-emission data sets fail to capture the complexity of Arctic-lake types 9 , specifically, their geological settings 10 , potential C sources 11 , 12 and CH 4 versus CO 2 emission pathways 13 , 14.
Approximately 20% of the total lake area in northern permafrost regions formed via thermokarst, in which degradation of ice-rich permafrost results in subsidence, ponding and thaw of the underlying sediments 11.
 The initiation and expansion of thermokarst lakes is sensitive to climate change 15 , and has been identified as a mechanism for the rapid decomposition of ancient (defined here as ≥11,500 years years before the present (YBP), that is, late Pleistocene and older) permafrost C and its emission to the atmosphere 16 , 17 , 18.
 Under a warming climate, there is the potential for an enhanced decomposition and emission of this ancient and vast C reservoir to provide a positive feedback to climate change 14.
 Yet, the ability of thermokarst lakes to act as conduits for permafrost C emissions to the atmosphere as CH 4 has only been verified in lakes that actively thaw into yedoma, a fine-textured, C- and ice-rich, aeolian sediment of the Pleistocene steppe. These environmental conditions comprise just 12% (150,000 km 2 ) of the landscapes with prevalent lake thermokarst (1,300,000 km 2 ) in the northern circumpolar permafrost region (18,410,000 km 2 ) (refs 10 , 11 ), and therefore under-represent the environmental diversity of Arctic lakes.
Current estimates of permafrost C loss from lakes are based on age measurements (radiocarbon ( 14 C) dating) of CH 4 emitted by ebullition (bubbling). Measured ages are highly variable, ranging from 40,000 YBP to modern (C fixed from the atmosphere after 1950) within a single lake 16 , 17 , 19 , 21.
 Ebullition itself is highly sporadic, and daily rates can span three orders of magnitude 13 , 22 , 23 , 24.
 And, although ebullition is probably the primary CH 4 emission pathway in actively expanding yedoma–thermokarst lakes (79% of the total emissions on average) 2 , 18 , diffusive CH 4 emissions can dominate whole-lake emissions in non-yedoma systems 13 , 25.
 Furthermore, northern lakes can also be large CO 2 sources 26 , but few studies have simultaneously quantified CH 4 and CO 2 emissions 22 , 27 or their C-source ages 28 , which leaves an incomplete understanding of the role of lakes in the climate feedback of permafrost C.
Study location and approach This study quantified whether ancient permafrost or young organic C (OC) dominates whole-lake C emissions from lakes on Alaska’s North Slope, and the proportion emitted as CH 4.
 In our 250,000 km 2 study region, lakes are a dominant landscape feature 29 , formed by a variety of processes, which include thermokarst, in a diverse range of geological substrates 9.
 Most of the North Slope remained unglaciated during the most-recent glacial maximum (~27–19 kyr ago) and has accumulated sediments with varying OC 30 and ice content 31.
 The general surficial geology is delineated by mixtures of marine gravel, sand, silt and clay (coastal-plain geology), glaciomarine deposits near the Beaufort and Chukchi Sea coasts 9 , 32 , a 250 × 60 km 2 zone of aeolian sand further inland 33 , yedoma-type aeolian silt along the northern edge of the Brooks range 34 and rivers that flow south to north with floodplain corridors underlain by fluvial sand and glacial outwash (Supplementary Fig.
1 ).
We quantified the 14 C age, 13 C content and concentrations of mass-integrated, whole-lake diffusive CH 4 and CO 2 in up to 40 lakes that span seven geological sediment types 35 , thermokarst and non-thermokarst lake types, and a 3.5 °C gradient in mean annual air temperature (Supplementary Table 1 ). The 40 lakes were studied over two winters (April 2013 and April 2014), and seven were studied during one summer (August 2014). Isotope measurements were made on CH 4 and CO 2 dissolved beneath floating ice in late winter, when the majority of any ebullition gas, trapped beneath the ice, would have dissolved into the lake water over the ice-cover season 36.
 We assume that the 14 C signature of dissolved ebullition gas would alter the whole-lake dissolved 14 C signature by the principle of mass balance (see equation ( 8 )), and that the below-ice 14 C signature of dissolved gases represents the mass-integrated value of the whole-lake emissions. Cumulative daily C fluxes for the open-water period were estimated by extrapolating the mean of triplicate dissolved CH 4 and CO 2 measurements, made on either a single day ( n = 7) or on two days (one week apart) ( n = 2) in August 2014, using daily air and water temperature, and daily wind speed. Annual diffusive emissions (g C) of CH 4 and CO 2 were estimated for each lake surveyed in the summer by adding an estimate of the springtime ice-out diffusive flux (based on below-ice accumulation) to cumulative daily fluxes from the ice-free period (Table 1 ( Methods )).
Full size table We estimated the mean and probable range of ancient permafrost C contributions to the whole-lake emissions of CH 4 and CO 2 with a five-source isotope mass-balance model 37.
 Carbon-source categories included C fixed from the atmosphere during 1950–2012 (which represents 14 C-enriched CO 2 from nuclear weapons testing), in 2013 (recent photoassimilates), 5,000 YBP (mid-Holocene), 11,500 YBP (end of the Pleistocene) and from 14 C-free sources (>50,000 YBP) (equation ( 8 )).
Sources of CH 4 and CO 2 emissions All lakes but one were oversaturated in CH 4 and CO 2 ( n = 40) (Fig.
1 and Supplementary Table 2 ). When an estimate of the ice-out flux is included, we found that all the lakes were sources of C to the atmosphere. Mean daily fluxes were 6.2 ± 3.4 mg CH 4 m −2 d −1 and 2,620 ± 2,240 mg CO 2 m −2 d −1 ( n = 7), and within the range previously reported from North Slope lakes using similar methods 27.
 Total lake-C emissions from the study area were 0.94 ± 0.14 Tg C yr −1 (C here is diffusive C-CO 2 + C-CH 4 ) (Table 1 ) and C-CO 2 emissions were over 180 times larger, on average, than C-CH 4 emissions.

 Values are averaged from the 2013 and 2014 winter measurements. Dashed horizontal lines indicate the 14 C signature of atmospheric CO 2 in the summer of 2013. Boxes indicate the 25th and 75th percentiles, and error bars are the 10th and 90th percentiles. Solid horizontal lines within boxes indicate the median. Open stars are outliers. Numbers within the parentheses indicate the number of lakes observed in each geological unit. Statistically different groups with respect to mean 14 C age are indicated by either (i) or (ii) (single-factor ANOVA and Tukey’s HSD post hoc analysis ( F (4, 21) = 19.49, P = 7.92 × 10 −7 ) and ( F (4, 30) = 10.85, P = 1.46 × 10 −5 ) for CH 4 and CO 2 , respectively).
Full size image Ages of whole-lake diffusive C emissions were much younger (Fig.
2 and Table 1 ) than the age of CH 4 emitted from yedoma–thermokarst lakes in Siberia and Central Alaska 16 , 17 and the age of permafrost C sources (>50,000 to 6,000 YBP) 19.
 Ages ranged from modern to 3,300 ± 70 YBP for dissolved CH 4 , and from modern to 1,590 ± 20 YBP for dissolved CO 2.
 The lake-category-weighted mean 14 C ages for the study region were 847 YBP for CH 4 ( n = 49 measurements) and 392 YBP for CO 2 ( n = 68). In all lakes but one, dissolved CH 4 was on average 400 14 C-years older than CO 2 (Fig.
2 and Table 1 ). This may reflect a combination of modern atmospheric CO 2 equilibrating with lake waters, CO 2 production from the aerobic decomposition of younger organic material produced within lakes and imported from surrounding soils, and methanogenesis being fuelled by older sedimentary and soil C sources. Stable isotope data (δD and δ 13 C (δ 13 C = [( 13 C/ 12 C) sample /( 13 C/ 12 C) standard ] − 1)) of CH 4 confirmed a microbial CH 4 origin in our lakes 38.
 In our study, the δ 13 C of dissolved CH 4 below ice was −56.7 ± 12.4‰ ( n = 16) (Supplementary Table 2 ), which again indicates microbial CH 4 (δ 13 C < −50‰) (ref.
39 ). The 14 C and 13 C data both demonstrate that lake-C emissions originated primarily from the degradation of recently formed terrestrial C, such as shallow-lake sediment C and surrounding soil C, rather than fossil C seeping through gaps in the permafrost from near-surface coal beds 40 or from C in sublake thawed sediments (talik) deposited during the Pleistocene 16.
Values, expressed as FM and 14 C age (YBP), represent the below-ice mean values from April 2013 and April 2014 ( n = 2) or either the 2013 or 2014 value ( n = 1). Error bars represent the s.d. when n = 2, or the procedural and analytical error when n = 1; in either case, the larger of the two is shown. Larger errors for CH 4 , relative to CO 2 , represent a combination of greater interannual variability and smaller sample size, for which procedural and analytical errors are more impactful. A greater distance from the 1:1 line indicates a greater 14 C content (age) difference between CH 4 and CO 2.
 Values greater than FM = 1 (shaded area) indicate samples that contain C fixed from the atmosphere post calendar year 1950.
Full size image Seasonal effects on dissolved CH 4 and CO 2 isotopes Comparing winters within the same lakes, dissolved CH 4 was 38% older on average in 2014 than in 2013 ( p < 0.05, n = 12); however, we found no difference in the ages of dissolved CO 2 ( p > 0.05, n = 19). Seasonally, the mean age of dissolved CH 4 in the winter was 180 14 C-years older than that in the summer ( p < 0.05, n = 6), and the mean age of dissolved CO 2 in the winter was 620 14 C-years older than that in the summer ( p < 0.05, n = 6). The older CO 2 observed below ice probably reflects a diminished aerobic decomposition of fresh (and young) organic material beneath the ice, and/or limited atmospheric exchange through the ice. We also found strong evidence for the oxidation of CH 4 into CO 2 , which could also explain the older below-ice CO 2 values because CH 4 was consistently older than the concomitant CO 2.
 The mean 14 C values of coexisting dissolved CH 4 and CO 2 were positively correlated across all the study lakes ( r = 0.93, p < 0.05, n = 26) (Fig.
2 ). This relationship implies CH 4 oxidation in the water column, in which the resulting dissolved CO 2 carries the 14 C signature of the oxidized CH 4.
 However, co-production of CH 4 and CO 2 with the same 14 C signature in sediments during acetate fermentation may also be a factor, especially where coexisting CH 4 and CO 2 are closer in 14 C age. If we assume that CH 4 oxidation is the only factor that alters the 14 C signature of below-ice dissolved CO 2 , a two-source 14 C mass-balance mixing model (which utilizes the previous summer 14 CO 2 and winter 14 CH 4 values as the end members) can be used to estimate that 60 ± 15% ( n = 5) of below-ice dissolved CO 2 may have originated from oxidized CH 4.
 In support of this hypothesis, we found that below-ice dissolved CH 4 was enriched in 13 C in six lakes (δ 13 C ranged from −39.5‰ to −19.0‰) relative to the common products of methanogenesis (δ 13 C from −110 to −50‰) (ref.
39 ). Likewise, significant negative relationships between below-ice dissolved CH 4 concentrations and δ 13 CH 4 in lakes when δ 13 CH 4 > −60‰ were also observed ( R 2 = 0.59, n = 4 in 2013, and R 2 = 0.91, n = 7 in 2014 ( p < 0.05)). Both observations are indicative that CH 4 consumption enriches the 13 C in residual dissolved CH 4 in a semiclosed system below ice. Together, these findings support our observations that the dissolved C-CO 2 pool was four times larger than the C-CH 4 pool, that below-ice CH 4 oxidation may age the dissolved C-CO 2 pool and that within-lake CH 4 oxidation regulates the global warming impact of Arctic lakes.
Emission ages in relation to geological substrate The interannual and seasonal variation in mean gas ages for individual lakes was small compared with the age differences observed across geological units (around 160%). Across the North Slope, C-emission ages were clearly related to the surficial geological unit that underlies the lakes (Figs.
1 and 3 ). Dissolved CH 4 and CO 2 were significantly younger in lakes in sandy and fluvial deposits compared with those in finer-textured coastal, glaciomarine and aeolian silt (yedoma-type) deposits ( p < 0.05, Single factor analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey’s honest significant difference (HSD) test and post hoc analysis) (Fig.
1 ). Mean gas ages in lakes that reside on glacial deposits were not significantly different from gas ages in any other geological unit.
Circles indicate the location of 27 lakes measured for below-ice dissolved 14 CH 4 ( n = 1−2 per lake). Methane ages were interpolated using inverse distance weighting with a 1/20 weight reduction parameter for predictions in non-similar geology categories (equations ( 9 )–( 11 )), which gives the effect of pronounced geology boundaries. Major geological boundaries are also emphasized with black lines. Geological units: A. sand, aeolian sand; A. silt, aeolian silt; CP, coastal plain; FO, fluvial old; FY, fluvial young; GM, glaciomarine; GY, glacial young. Grey areas represent unobserved geological units.
Methods and Supplementary Fig.

Full size image Sedimentary OC The geological substrate incorporates sediment texture, and thus the ground ice content, thermokarst behaviour and C-retention properties of the landscape. In contrast with lakes that form in sandy deposits, lakes in finer, ice-rich sediments exhibit a greater post-thaw subsidence, and thus can quickly degrade deeper (and presumably older) permafrost 9.
 Also, as fine-textured Pleistocene aeolian silt on the North Slope sequestered more C, lakes that formed into such deposits have more ancient sedimentary OC available within their taliks for potential decomposition than lakes in sand, given similar thaw depths. We determined that the OC content of aeolian silt (0.95 ± 0.34% OC, n = 38) was relatively OC rich compared with that of the adjacent aeolian sand (0.19 ± 0.10% OC, n = 29) ( p < 0.05) (Supplementary Table 3 ). This result is similar to previous reports of the North Slope silt 34 , yet less than that of other yedoma-type sediments 10.
 The large difference in sedimentary OC observed between sand and silt is also reflected in the five-source isotope model solutions, in which ancient C accounts for an average of 15% of the whole-lake C emissions (CH 4 plus CO 2 ) from lakes in silt versus 9% from those in sand (Fig.
4 and Table 1 ). As finer deposits dominate both ends of our transects, we found no correlation of CH 4 or CO 2 age with latitude or mean annual air temperature. Hence, our results demonstrate that local environmental heterogeneity (that is, variable % OC in the substrate) is a better proxy for whole-lake diffusive C-emission ages than is broad climatic regulation on the North Slope.
Proportional source contributions to the mean 14 C signature of dissolved CH 4 are shown with hashed boxes, with open boxes for that of CO 2.

Full size image Regional CH 4 and CO 2 fluxes Our regional assessment clearly demonstrates that terrestrial C, fixed from the atmosphere within the past few millennia, is the dominant source of whole-lake C emissions on the North Slope today, and that the current emissions of ancient C are minimal and restricted to lakes that reside in fine-textured sediments (Figs.
1 , 3 and 4 ). The annual diffusive CH 4 flux extrapolated from all the lakes (total lake area, 10,659 km 2 ) in our study region (231,157 km 2 ) was (5.0 ± 0.8) × 10 −3 Tg C-CH 4 yr −1 , of which ancient permafrost C sources contribute a mean of 14%, with a range of 0–38% (10th to 90th percentile range of the mixing-model solutions) (Fig.
4 and Table 1 ). This is equivalent to an ancient C flux of 7.2 × 10 −4 Tg C-CH 4 yr −1 (Table 1 ). The total annual diffusive CO 2 emissions were 0.94 ± 0.14 Tg C-CO 2 yr −1 , with a mean contribution of 11% (range from 0 to 25%) from ancient C (Fig.
4 and Table 1 ). Ancient C-CO 2 emissions (0.10 Tg C-CO 2 yr −1 ) were 150 times greater than that via CH 4 , which implies that CO 2 diffusion is the dominant pathway for ancient C loss from the North Slope.
Discussion and conclusion Emissions of C to the atmosphere from ancient sources amplify climate warming because they represent a net addition to the active C cycle. Emissions of ancient C were greatest per unit area ((1.7 ± 0.5) × 10 7 g C km −2 yr −1 ) and collectively ((5.7 ± 2.0) × 10 10 g C yr −1 ) from the lakes in the coastal plain geology unit (Table 1 ). This is a result of the greater overall lake area (Table 1 ), a higher proportion of ancient C that contributes to the emissions and a relatively older CO 2 that accounts for a higher proportion of the total diffusive flux (Table 1 ). Recent work suggests that increasing winter water temperatures are preventing lakes in this region from freezing completely in the winter 15 , which potentially allows aged organic material in newly developing taliks to contribute to greenhouse-gas production.
The ancient C flux was dominated by diffusive CO 2 emissions (0.10 ± 0.01 Tg C-CO 2 yr −1 , or 99% of the total ancient C emissions (Table 1 )). Ice-free CH 4 ebullition was neither directly observed nor estimated in our study. However, if ice-free ebullition represented 79% of the total ice-free CH 4 emissions (as observed in yedoma–thermokarst lakes 2 ) and was sourced completely from ancient C, cumulative emissions of ancient C via CO 2 diffusion would still exceed the CH 4 emissions (diffusion plus the hypothetical ancient ice-free ebullition of 0.02 Tg C-CH 4 yr −1 ) in our region by over a factor of four. Nevertheless, in this unlikely scenario the climate-warming potential of ancient C emissions as CH 4 is far greater than that of CO 2 , because CH 4 is 30 times more effective as a net radiative forcer on a molecule-to-molecule basis and on a 100-year timescale 41.
 Ancient C flux as CH 4 would outweigh the global warming potential of observed ancient C emission via CO 2 diffusion if ice-free CH 4 ebullition comprised roughly 70% of the total diffusive CH 4 emissions in our study lakes ((5.0 ± 0.8) × 10 −3 Tg–C-CH 4 yr −1 ) and was purely sourced from ancient C. This finding emphasizes the need for climate feedback studies of permafrost C to distinguish CH 4 from CO 2 emissions and whether each gas is predominantly sourced from ancient or young C.
Our regional-scale assessment provides an important baseline dataset for monitoring the emission sources of CH 4 and CO 2 from the climate-sensitive North Slope lakes. It also demonstrates that lakes in Arctic Alaska currently emit CH 4 and CO 2 predominantly from C pools that cycle between the land and atmosphere on timescales of decades to four millennia, even in areas where the lakes are actively eroding into relatively C-rich Pleistocene permafrost. Consequently, the Alaskan Arctic lakes are important systems for processing and returning freshly fixed C back to the atmosphere. Future emissions of ancient C are likely to increase, but our work provides further evidence that they will be restricted to areas in which the combination of warming temperatures, ancient OC and thermokarst favour the development of new or expanding taliks and shorelines 18 , 42.
 Finally, diffusive CO 2 emissions from young C sources currently account for nearly all (99%) of gaseous C loss from the North Slope lakes. Our multiyear regional lake survey concludes that future Arctic greenhouse-gas-emission research must consider the complexity of lake-forming processes, the variable geological settings of the entire circumpolar region and whether relatively fresh and young C or decomposing ancient permafrost C dominate the C cycling of Arctic lakes.
Methods Sample collection Water and dissolved-gas samples were collected from 40 lakes (≥0.27 ha) on the North Slope of Alaska, USA (Supplementary Table 1 ). The lakes are part of the Circum-Arctic Lakes Observation Network (CALON, www.arcticlakes.org ). The CALON lakes are distributed along a 'western' and an 'eastern transect that spans 150 and 300 km and is centred along the −156.5° W and −151.9° W parallels, respectively. On each transect, the lakes are divided into 3–8 clusters, which span local lake sizes 43.
 Most lakes are shallow (mean 2.4 m, range 0.5–11.8 m) and probably well mixed. Along each transect, coastal lakes are characterized by cooler summer temperatures and a shorter ice-free period than lakes located further inland 44.
For radiocarbon ( 14 C) analyses of dissolved CH 4 and CO 2 , the lakes were sampled near their centres twice a year, with and without ice cover, in North Slope lake in 2013 and 2014. During the winter (April) of 2013 the CALON team collected water from below the ice from 19 lakes on the western transect and 17 lakes on the eastern transect, and in the winter (April) of 2014 from 23 lakes solely on the western transect. A hole 25 cm in diameter was drilled with an Eskimo auger (Shark Z51 (Eskimo)) and 1.3 l of water were collected without headspace into Nalgene square polyethylene terephthalate (PETE) media bottles with natural high density polyethylene screw caps (342040-1000 (Thermo Scientific)). As the sample froze, the bottles expanded to accommodate the volume change. Once thawed, the bottles regained their original shape. Samples were frozen in the field and kept frozen until further processing at the University of California (UC) Irvine.
During the summer, samples were collected in surface waters near the centre of each lake using a novel gas-extraction technique with a Liqui-Celpmembrane contactor. Lake water was pumped (1.2 l min −1 ) for 60 min through a series of four particulate filters (178 and 40 μm stainless-steel mesh filters T-29595-39 and T-2959-35 (Cole-Parmer), and 20 μm and 5 μm 5″ polypropylene sediment depth filters SD-25-0520 Flow-Pro and SD-25-0505 Hydronix (FreshWatersystems)) and past a degassing membrane contactor (Liqui-Cel (Membrana)), in which bulk dissolved gases (including N 2 , CH 4 and CO 2 ) were collected in a pre-evacuated, pre-weighed 2 l stainless steel canister with a stainless steel bellows sealed valve (SS-4BG (Swagelok)). To prevent cross-contamination, all the filters were replaced and the system was flushed with lake water for 30 min prior to each sampling event. To prevent microbial activity, the whole system was flushed with dilute H 3 PO 4 acid for 10 min and then clean tap water for 15 min daily (after about four samples) and stored dry. This system eliminates the need to store and ship an average of 100 l of water for the extraction of ≥0.1 mg C-CH 4 , or approximately 10 l for the same amount of C-CO 2 per sample for 14 C analysis. At the same time and location, we measured water temperature and pH (PCD 650 (Oakton Instruments)).
During the summer of 2014, the lakes were also analysed for dissolved CH 4 and CO 2 concentrations. At the centre of each lake, three replicates of 20 ml of surface lake water were manually injected into capped (blue butyl rubber septa, CLS-4209-14 (Chemglass Life Sciences)) pre-evacuated 40 ml crimp-sealed glass vials over the course of 2 h. The vials were pre-loaded with 20 μl of aqueous mercuric chloride to inhibit microbial activity.
General surficial geological units The descriptions of each general geology unit defined in this work (coastal plain, aeolian sand, aeolian silt, fluvial old, fluvial young, glaciomarine, and glacial young) are already published 35.
Laboratory analyses Radiocarbon analysis Dissolved gases were extracted from frozen water samples collected during the winter. One day prior to extraction, and when still frozen, the original screw caps on the sample bottles were replaced with septum caps (38–430 Microlink Open Top, Wheaton, custom 1/8″ thick butyl rubber septa (McMaster-Carr)) in a pure N 2 atmosphere. The sample was then left to thaw at room temperature overnight. Post-thaw, a 15% headspace was created with ultrapure N 2 (NI UHP300 (Airgas)) in the bottle to produce the most-efficient CH 4 extraction conditions for CH 4 (ref.
45 ) as dissolved CH 4 is typically in lower abundance than CO 2.
 Dissolved gases were transferred to pre-evacuated, weighed 2 l stainless-steel canisters via headspace extraction.
Canisters that contained the winter and summer samples of dissolved gas were weighed to quantify the mass of dissolved gases collected and then balanced to 1 atm with ultrazero (C-free) air (AI UZ300 (Airgas)). The canister was then connected to a flow-through vacuum extraction line designed to extract sequentially CH 4 and CO 2 for 14 C analysis 46.
 As the sample gas is introduced to the vacuum line, (1) CO 2 is frozen out in a liquid nitrogen (LN) trap, (2) carbon monoxide is converted into CO 2 at 290 °C and frozen out in a second LN trap and (3) CH 4 is oxidized to CO 2 in a 975 °C furnace with cupric oxide pellets. CH 4 -derived CO 2 and sample CO 2 were purified on the vacuum line, quantified manometrically and converted into graphite using the sealed-tube zinc-reduction method 47.
 Isotopic standards were extracted using the same methods to evaluate the procedural contamination of the sampling methods extraction-line system (see below).
Alongside the procedural and analytical standards and 14 C-free blanks, which represented all sampling and processing steps (see below), the graphite was measured for its 14 C/ 12 C ratio with an accelerator mass spectrometer (AMS) at the W.M. Keck Carbon Cycle Accelerator Mass Spectrometer facility at UC Irvine 48 (equation ( 1 ) and Supplementary Table 2 ). For samples >0.2 mg C, an aliquot of the CH 4 -derived CO 2 or the sample CO 2 was analysed for δ 13 C with isotope-ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) (GasBench II coupled to a Delta plus IRMS (Thermo Fisher Scientific) (Supplementary Table 2 ): $${\left.\frac{{}^{14}{\rm{C}}}{{}^{12}{\rm{C}}}\right]}_{{\rm{s}}ample,-25\textperthousand }={\left.\frac{{}^{14}{\rm{C}}}{{}^{12}{\rm{C}}}\right]}_{{\rm{s}}ample}\left(\frac{1+-25/1,000}{1+\delta/1,000}\right)^{2}$$ $${\rm{F}}M=\frac{{\left.\frac{{}^{14}C}{{}^{12}C}\right]}_{{\rm{s}}ample,-25\textperthousand }}{0.95{\left.\frac{{}^{14}C}{{}^{12}{\rm{C}}}\right]}_{OX1[-19\textperthousand ]}}$$ Radiocarbon values are reported in FM, which is the 14 C to 12 C ratio in the sample relative to that of the oxalic acid-1 standard (OX1) (equation ( 2 )). The measured sample ratio is normalized to a δ 13 C value of −25‰ to correct for the mass-dependent fractionation of 14 C (via measuring δ 13 C simultaneously in the AMS (δ in equation ( 1 )), divided by 0.95 times the activity of OX1 to normalize to the conventional pre-industrial wood standard in 1950, where the OX1 standard is corrected to its actual δ 13 C value of −19‰ (ref.
49 ): Mean 14 C ages reported in YBP (equation ( 3 )), which represents a 14 C age calculated from the averaged FM values from equation ( 2 ): $${}^{14}{\rm{C}}\,{\rm{a}}ge\left({\rm{Y}}BP\right)=-8,033\,ln\left({\rm{F}}M\right)$$ where 8,033 is the mean lifetime of 14 C, in years, using the Libby half-life of 5,568 years. When calculating mean 14 C ages, any FM values >1 (indicative of samples that contain 'bomb 14 C' from post-1950 above-ground nuclear weapons testing) were replaced with 1 (calendar year 1950, FM of OX1) and then averaged across all the study lakes and within the general geology types.
We report 14 C ages, as opposed to calibrated-calendar ages, because dissolved CH 4 and CO 2 represent an open system that exchanges with various other C pools with presumably different 14 C ages within the lakes’ C cycle. Calibrated-calendar ages only apply to C material in closed systems, in which the radioactive decay of 14 C is the only flux term. In our case the 14 C age serves as a tracer for the C source of the dissolved CH 4 and CO 2.
Validation of 14 C results produced from the sampling methods As mentioned above, we developed two methods for sampling dissolved CH 4 and CO 2 for C-isotope analysis in relatively high concentration below-ice waters (winter), and in low-concentration open waters (summer). To validate the isotopic data produced from these methods, we conduced laboratory tests to determine whether our methods introduced any measurement bias or extraneous C that would affect the true 14 C and 13 C signature of the sampled gases.
Tests of the winter method demonstrated minimal extraneous C and fractionation effects in both CO 2 and CH 4 for both 14 C and 13 C. The modern 14 C blank was small and reproducible (~1.5 μg C and 2.5 μg C for CH 4 and CO 2 , respectively (Supplementary Fig.
3 )). This represents just 0.02% of the average extraction yields for both dissolved CH 4 and CO 2 in the winter samples, and had a negligible effect on the measured values after the 14 C extraneous-mass correction. Additionally, we saw no effect from using the Nalgene PETE bottles, as their 14 CH 4 results were indistinguishable from those produced from headspace extractions using glass bottles. Likewise, the replicates of modern-C biogas lab standards (assessment of 14 C-free C contamination), regardless of the sample size, yielded results within the range of 20 measurements of the biogas standards directly injected and combusted on the extraction line (Supplementary Fig.
3 ). To test the potential fractionation of 13 C in CH 4 and CO 2 , we also compared the 13 C results from headspace extractions with those of direct injection and combustion. For the direct injection and combustion of CH 4 , the δ 13 C value was −48.32 ± 0.21‰ ( n = 3) compared with −48.37 ± 0.07‰ ( n = 8) for the headspace extractions—a deviation comparable to the IRMS measurement error (~0.02‰). For the direct injection of CO 2 , the δ 13 C value was −5.2 ± 0.07‰ ( n = 3), comparable to −5.3 ± 0.48‰ ( n = 4) for the headspace extractions, which is also negligible.
We also tested the potential extraneous 14 C-free C contamination of the Liqui-Cel system (used for low-concentration open waters) (Supplementary Fig.
4 ). Similar systems using Liqui-Cel membranes have proved successful for minimal and reproducible 14 C blanks in marine settings, in which much greater volumes of water are degassed 50.
 A recirculation system was built in the lab such that approximately 2 l of ultrapure deionized water (brought to pH ≈ 2 with dilute H 3 PO 4 ) could be sparged with ultrahigh pressure (UHP) N 2 and flushed through the system to remove all the ambient gases and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) prior to the injection of modern biogas gas standards (CH 4 and CO 2 ). Similar to flushing with sample water in the field, the recirculating system was flushed with the N 2 -sparged acidified water for 30 min, prior to the extraction of dissolved gases. After the flushing period, gas standards were injected into the recirculating water stream via a septa port and extracted through the Liqui-Cel membrane for 1 h (same duration as in the field sampling). Supplementary Fig.
4 shows the results from four replications of varying size for CH 4 and CO 2 relative to the consensus values for the respective biogas standards. We determined the consistent addition of extraneous 14 C-free CO 2 over 1 h to be 25 ± 7.5 μg, which is roughly 3% of the mean mass yield for open-water dissolved CO 2 samples. For CH 4 , we determined a smaller extraneous 14 C-free C effect of 2 ± 1 μg, which corresponds to approximately 2% of the mean mass yields for open-water dissolved CH 4 samples. We applied these mass corrections and associated errors to all 14 C data produced from the Liqui-Cel system. As all 14 C data are also normalized to δ 13 C = −25‰ during the AMS measurement (see above), any potential mass-dependent fractionation of the Liqui-Cel system or other sample-processing steps is reconciled in the final measurement and irrelevant for reported 14 C data.
Although we made considerable effort to mirror field sampling, the recirculation system in the lab does not replicate perfectly the open-system sampling in the field. During field sampling, water is not recirculated through the membrane and water filters, but is pumped out of the system and back into the lake, away from the intake. We believe this means our extraneous 14 C mass correction is conservative and probably overestimated for both CH 4 and CO 2.
Regional mean 14 C ages for dissolved CH 4 and CO 2 emissions We estimated the regional mean age of diffusive CH 4 and CO 2 (847 and 392 YBP, respectively) emissions using a lake-area-weighted mean. Specifically, the mean age for each gas in each geological unit was weighted by the proportional lake area in that unit to the total lake area.
Dissolved-gas concentration analysis Methane and CO 2 were analysed by flame-ionization detection using a Shimadzu GC-2014 gas chromatograph (Shimadzu) at the USGS Woods Hole Coastal and Marine Science Center. Prior to analysis, vials that contained the 20 ml water samples were brought to 1 atm by injecting UHP He through the vial septa. The vials were then overpressured slightly by the addition of 3.2 ml He-sparged, low-pH water. Reducing the pH to <2 transferred all the DIC species to the headspace as CO 2.
 After a 2 h equilibration, 3.2 ml of the headspace was removed from the vial. Gas and water exchanges were achieved using Becton-Dickinson plastic syringes and 18-gauge needles (Becton, Dickinson and Co.) connected via a plastic three-way stopcock. The extracted headspace gas was injected into a 22 ml min −1 He carrier gas through a gas-sampling valve, and CH 4 and CO 2 were separated at 80 °C on a 80/100 mesh HayeSep D (Hayes Separations) (5 m × 1/8 outside diameter) packed column. CO 2 was analysed as CH 4 after its reduction with a methanizer. Concentrations of CH 4 and CO 2 were determined against Scott Gas certified gas standards (Air Liquide) that spanned the range of observed values. Headspace CH 4 concentrations were converted into dissolved concentrations using a literature method 51.
 Total DIC, or [DIC] Total , measured in the headspace of the acidified samples, was converted into pCO 2 (or CO 2aq ) for use in lake–air gas exchange calculations following the conventions of Stumm and Morgan 52 : $$\left[{{\rm{C}}O}_{{2}_{{\rm{a}}q}}\right]=\frac{{\left[{\rm{D}}IC\right]}_{{\rm{T}}otal}}{1+\left(\frac{{K}_{1}}{\left[{{\rm{H}}}^{+}\right]}\right)+\left({K}_{1}\frac{{K}_{2}}{{\left[{{\rm{H}}}^{+}\right]}^{2}}\right)}$$ here [H + ] is the hydrogen ion concentration based on lake pH and K 1 and K 2 are the lake-temperature-adjusted equilibrium constants for the dissociation of H 2 CO 3 and HCO 3 − , respectively. CO 2aq is used as C w in equation ( 5 ).
Sedimentary OC content A volumetric sampler (747 cm 3 ) was used to collect sediment from a stratigraphic section (69° 51′ 5.84″ N 154° 51′ 48.26″ W) of aeolian sand and silt that is representative of the permafrost and talik deposits underlying the lakes in these respective surficial geology units of the North Slope. This frozen sediment was cleared on a near vertical face and allowed to thaw just before sampling. To analyse % OC, we first removed soil carbonates by soaking 1 cm 3 of dry sediment in a 10% HCl mixture overnight. We assumed that this removed all carbonate because: (1) a visual inspection of the untreated sediments determined the majority of inorganic C to be calcite (removed by 10% HCl at room temperature) and (2) % OC in HCl-treated samples was strongly positively correlated with the root biomass in the same samples (which means non-pedogenic carbonate was not a factor). Samples were then centrifuged, decanted and rinsed with deionized water until to reach a pH of 5.5. Acidified sediment samples were then analysed for C content on a C:N analyser (TruSpec (LECO) by analysing the products of sample combustion at 950 °C for CO 2 and using an infrared CO 2 detector at the Forest Soils Laboratory at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. We estimated the analytical precision as the s.d. of values based on two replicates of the National Institute of Standards and Technology Buffalo River Sediment standards per 40 samples. The total s.d. for all the standards was <0.02% OC.
Regional CH 4 and CO 2 lake–atmosphere diffusive flux The fluxes ( F ) of dissolved CH 4 and CO 2 were calculated using a Fickian diffusion model: $$F=k\left({C}_{{\rm{w}}}-{C}_{{\rm{a}}}\right)$$ Where C w is the concentration of either CH 4 or CO 2 in the water, C a is the concentration of CH 4 or CO 2 in the surface water that is in equilibrium with the atmosphere and k is the water-to-air gas-exchange velocity. In an effort to constrain the temporal variability, we collected three water samples for dissolved CH 4 and CO 2 concentrations over the course of approximately 2 h in the same location near the centre of each lake. In our flux calculation, C w represents the mean of the three samples. Atmospheric background values of 1.91 ppm for CH 4 and 400 ppm for CO 2 were taken from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Barrow, AK observatory Global Monitoring Division database, and used to calculate C a.
 To determine k , we used the model of Cole and Caraco 53 , which empirically determined the relationship of k 600 (cm hr −1 ) and wind speed at 10 m ( U 10 (m s −1 )) to be: $${k}_{600}=2.07+0.215{U}_{10}^{1.7}$$ Once k 600 is known, it is converted to k via: $$k=\frac{{k}_{600}}{{\left(600{\rm{/}}Sc\right)}^{-0.5}}$$ Where Sc is the temperature-adjusted Schmidt number of either CH 4 or CO 2.
We assumed that all the diffusive fluxes of CH 4 and CO 2 occurred between ice breakup in the spring and freeze-up in the fall. In August of 2014, a subset of seven lakes within the glaciomarine, coastal plain, aeolian sand and aeolian silt geology categories were sampled for dissolved CH 4 and CO 2 at the surface. Daily fluxes were estimated for each lake for every ice-free day in 2014. For each lake, the ice-free period was determined as the cumulative number of days starting from the day before rapid warming was observed (indicative of ice break-up) and ending on the last day where daily average water temperature was above freezing (on average 122 d for the whole study region). This was determined from hourly water-temperature observations obtained by CALON (NSF Award no. 1107607) buoy monitoring stations. The temperature data were downloaded from the NSF Arctic Data Center ( https://arcticdata.io/catalog/#data/page/0 ). Daily average water temperatures and wind speeds were also used to calculate the average solubility and gas-exchange velocities ( k ), respectively, for CH 4 and CO 2 during each day of the ice-free period. Historical daily average wind data for the ice-free period was downloaded for stations at Barrow, AK and Atqasuk, AK from the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information web service ( http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/ ). Wind data from either Barrow or Atqasuk were used based on each lake’s proximity to either weather station.
The August concentrations of CH 4 and CO 2 , along with the lake pH measured at the time of sample collection, were applied to all ice-free days during the summer of 2014. This assumption is probably a source of error in our flux estimate. During the August survey, one lake (BRW 100) was replicated in time (measurements one week apart) and two others (BRW 130 and RDC 310) were replicated spatially (approximately 1 km apart on the lake). In both scenarios, the mean of the replicate concentration measurements was prescribed in the whole-summer flux calculations.
Winter (April 2014) dissolved-gas concentrations were calculated during the headspace equilibration technique (described above), in which the entire equilibrated headspace was collected and CH 4 and CO 2 were purified. Yields of CH 4 and CO 2 were measured manometrically using a calibrated baratron, and then used to determine the concentration of each gas in the original headspace. Headspace concentrations were then used with Henry’s Law to determine the dissolved-gas concentration in each sample. As below-ice concentrations of dissolved CH 4 and CO 2 were typically much higher than during the ice-free August survey, it is likely that excess gas was emitted during ice breakup in the spring. Ice growth probably reaches a maximum depth in April.
Water-volume reduction from ice growth could explain 10–100% of the increased below-ice concentrations of dissolved CH 4 and CO 2 when compared with the concentrations in August. This effect was considered when estimating the rapid equilibration of dissolved gas with the atmosphere during the ice breakup in the spring (ice-out flux) from each lake. To estimate ice-out fluxes, we applied a concentration effect (based on the maximum ice thickness and lake volume) to August CH 4 and CO 2 concentration measurements. We then subtracted this concentration from the actual measured concentration below the ice in April. The difference was considered to be the CH 4 or CO 2 accumulation from sediment production and emission into the water during the ice-cover season. The accumulated mass was then divided by the number of days of ice cover in between when the ice first appeared on each lake in the autumn and the day that the below-ice concentrations were measured. This value (grams per day) is an estimate of the integrated average accumulation rate below the ice. Next, this rate was multiplied by the total number of ice-cover days to estimate the total accumulation of CH 4 and CO 2 below the ice in each lake. As this accumulation is conceived to be the excess dissolved CH 4 and CO 2 above the assumed open-water steady-state concentration measured in August, we interpret it as the total diffusive ice-out flux.
Including the estimate of ice-out fluxes, our regional average daily ice-free diffusive CH 4 flux was 6.2 ± 3.4 mg CH 4 m −2 d −1.
 This estimate is within the range of pan-Arctic diffusive emissions from tundra-thaw lakes (mean 15.6 mg CH 4 m −2 d −1 , range 0.5–90.1 mg CH 4 m −2 d −1 , n = 23) (ref.
2 ). Our ice-out CH 4 fluxes ranged from 0 to 14% ( n = 7) of total ice-free CH 4 diffusive flux, which is less than previous estimates from North Slope lakes 54.
 The average daily ice-free diffusive CH 4 flux (excluding ice-out flux) was 5.9 ± 0.1 mg CH 4 m −2 d −1 , and closely resembles the average of 6.9 mg CH 4 m −2 d −1 of an open-water diffusion-only flux previously observed using similar methods for North Slope lakes 27.
 Our mean daily diffusive CO 2 flux estimate of 2,620 ± 2,240 mg CO 2 m −2 d −1 is on the high end of the range of CO 2 fluxes reported by a previous study of 25 North Slope lakes 55.
Our data represent a minimum estimate for the total annual CH 4 fluxes from Alaskan Arctic thaw lakes because we did not include ice-free ebullition or ice-bubble-storage emissions 36 , 56 , 57.
 However, by measuring the diffusive CH 4 flux in the centre of the lakes, where the water/atmosphere gas exchange velocity is probably higher than on the lake margins, the whole-lake diffusive flux of CH 4 and CO 2 may be slightly overestimated 58.
Daily fluxes of CH 4 and CO 2 were calculated for each lake’s ice-free period. The values were totalled and added to each lake’s respective ice-out flux. This total value was treated as the annual diffusive flux for each lake.
All the lakes were sources of C to the atmosphere (regional total, 0.89 ± 0.2 Tg C yr −1 (C = C-CO 2 + C-CH 4 )). At the time of the flux measurement, one thaw lake, underlain by glaciomarine geology, was a sink for atmospheric CO 2 (−42.6 ± 0.7 mg C-CO 2 m −2 d −1 ). However, high CH 4 emissions combined with the estimated ice-out flux of CO 2 from this lake were enough to outweigh the observed C sink, even when the sink was extrapolated to the whole ice-free season (117 d). Overall, this lake was an annual CO 2 and CH 4 source to the atmosphere of 1.39 ± 0.04 Mg C-CO 2 + C-CH 4.
 We assumed this behaviour was consistent with that of other thaw lakes in the glaciomarine category and applied fluxes accordingly when upscaling to the whole region.
A lake survey in 2014 59 estimated that approximately 85,000 lakes of area >0.5 ha exist north of 68° N in Alaska. Using an ArcGIS shapefile (10,660 km 2 ) generated from this report and geospatial analysis, we determined the total lake surface area within each geology category where 14 C measurements were made. The total study area, including the land and lake area (231,157 km 2 ), was determined by summating the areas of all general geology units contained within the lake survey 59.
 Annual areal fluxes were averaged for each geological unit surveyed during August 2014 (seven lakes within four geologic units). For the geological units not sampled in August (fluvial young, fluvial old and glacial young (14% of the total lake area in study)), annual diffusive fluxes were prescribed from observed units that had similar below-ice concentrations in April. For lakes within the observed geological units (81% of the total), the annual diffusive C-CH 4 and C-CO 2 fluxes were estimated by multiplying the average areal fluxes in each geological unit by its respective total lake area. For lakes outside the observed geological units (19% of the total), the mean of the areal fluxes from the observed units was multiplied by the total lake area in the unobserved geology. To estimate the total annual diffusive flux from the entire study region, fluxes from the observed and unobserved lakes were added and are shown in Table 1.
The total diffusive flux of CH 4 and CO 2 sourced from ancient C (fixed from the atmosphere ≥11,500 YBP) was calculated by multiplying the mean fraction of the ancient C emissions (average of the possible contributions from 11.5 kYBP plus 14 C-free end members in the isotopic mass-balance model) for each geological unit by its respective total C flux. This gave the total ancient C flux (g) as both dissolved CH 4 and dissolved CO 2 for all the lakes in each geological unit. Similar to the total flux (described above), an estimate of the ancient C flux from lakes in the unobserved geological units was determined by multiplying the mean of the fraction of the ancient C from observed units by the estimated total C-CH 4 and C-CO 2 fluxes from the lakes in unobserved geology. This value was added to the total ancient flux from the lakes in observed units, and then divided by the total C flux (modern + ancient (for CH 4 and CO 2 )) and is presented as the flux-weighted fraction of total CH 4 and CO 2 emissions sourced from ancient C (Table 1 ).
Five-source isotopic mass-balance model IsoSource 37 , an open-source Visual Basic software, was used to compute the range of possible contributions from five prescribed sources ( f A , f B , f C , f D and f E ) to the mean FM value of dissolved CH 4 and CO 2 in each geology class: $$\begin{array}{l}{\rm{F}}{M}_{S}={f}_{{\rm{A}}F{M}_{A}}+{f}_{{\rm{B}}F{M}_{B}}+{f}_{{\rm{C}}F{M}_{C}}+{f}_{{\rm{D}}F{M}_{D}}+{f}_{{\rm{E}}F{M}_{E}}\\ 1={f}_{{\rm{A}}}+{f}_{{\rm{B}}}+{f}_{{\rm{C}}}+{f}_{{\rm{D}}}+{f}_{{\rm{E}}}\end{array}$$ where FM S is the predicted solution to the mass-balance equation and f A is the proportional source contribution from decaying C sequestered during the post-bomb period (1950–2012). For FM A , we used the integrated annual average of atmospheric 14 CO 2 from 1950–2012 from the Hua et al.
60 atmospheric record and extended it with the Barrow NOAA observatory record from X. Xu (personal communication) to give FM A = 1.2211. Similarly, f B is the proportional source contribution from decaying organic material of recent photosynthesis (calendar year 2013 atmospheric CO 2 FM B value = 1.0313) (also from the Barrow NOAA observatory (X. Xu, personal communication), f C represents the contribution from decaying 5,000 YBP organic C (FM C = 0.5366), f D represents decaying 11,500 YBP C (FM D = 0.2389) and f E represents 14 C-free 'also known as dead' C sources (FM E = 0). As there are more than two unknowns in equation ( 8 ), which allows no unique solution, this model uses the principle of mass balance to compute iteratively multiple combinations of feasible source contributions in 5% increments ( f A , f B , f C , f D and f E ). A combination of source proportions is considered feasible when the predicted solution (FM S ) falls within the 'tolerance value' range of the observed mean FM for each geological unit. The 'tolerance value' is equal to the standard error of the observed mean FM value for each geology class. Proportional contributions that fall outside the 10th and 90th percentile range of all computed solutions for a given source were considered unlikely and treated as outliers.
Geospatial extrapolation of CH 4 ages In the simplest form of inverse distance weighting (Fig.
3 ), predictions are made at an unobserved location using a weighted sum of the observations, in which the weights are inversely proportional to the distance between the unobserved and observed locations. As the 14 CH 4 age observed at a given location is correlated with its geological substrate type, we also include a parameter that reduces the weights of observations with geology types different from that of the predicted location.
Taken together, we estimate the 14 CH 4 age, Z , at an unobserved location, x , with geology type, g , as a weighted sum of the K 14 CH 4 age observations, Z k , at locations, x k , with geology type, g k , as: $$Z\left(x\right)={\sum }_{k=1}^{K}{w}_{k}{Z}_{k}/{\sum }_{k=1}^{K}{w}_{k}$$ with weights, w k : $${w}_{k}={\left|x-{x}_{k}\right|}^{-\beta }/G$$ and $$G=\left\{\begin{array}{cc}1 & {\rm{i}}f\,g={g}_{k}\\ 20 & {\rm{i}}f\,g\ne {g}_{k}\end{array}\right.$$ We use a typical value of β = 2, to reduce sharp gradients in the interpolated product. The choice of G was somewhat arbitrary and was selected based on visual inspection of the final product. Predictions were made on a regular 1 × 1 km grid over the study area bounded by 68.24°N – 71.66°N and 159.13°W – 147.77°W. We only retain predicted ages at a location if at least one observation has the same geology substrate type.
Although we cannot formally quantify the interpolation error for points without direct measurements, we can provide an estimate of the interpolation’s prediction quality in terms of the pairwise distances from measured and predicted points. We define a quality of prediction ( Q P ) at each predicted point as the effective number of measurements at a distance of 50 km that went into its interpolation (equation ( 12 ) and Supplementary Fig.
2 , Equation 12 ).
$${Q}^{P}=5{0}^{\beta }{\sum }_{k=1}^{K}{w}_{k}^{* }$$ where w k * is calculated in the same as w k in equation ( 10 ), but by forcing distances | x – x k | to take a minimum of 25 km. If this minimum distance was not applied, the Q P of the predicted points that are in very close proximity to the measured points is much less meaningful.
Averaging and statistics Where applicable (age of CH 4 versus CO 2 , ANOVA geology versus age for CH 4 and CO 2 , geospatial interpolation of CH 4 , end-member determination for isotopic mass balance for CH 4 and CO 2 , and summer 2014 spatial and temporal replicates), replicate samples (spatial or temporal) were averaged before the statistical tests were conducted. Supplementary Table 4 gives a detailed summary of the statistical results and analysis.
