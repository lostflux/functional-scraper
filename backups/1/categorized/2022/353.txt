Terra Nova: Timing of partial melting and granulite formation during the genesis of high to ultra-high temperature terranes: Insight from numerical experiments 20 April, 2022 by Dietmar Müller Long-lived high to ultra-high temperature (HT-UHT) granulitic terranes formed throughout Earth’s history. Yet, the detailed processes involved in their formation re- main unresolved and notably the sequence of appearance and duration of migmatisa- tion and granulites conditions in the orogenic cycle. These processes can be evaluated by analytical and numerical models. First, solving the steady-state … Read more… Categories News , Plate Tectonics & Geodynamics , Publications Tags Bénédicte Cenki-Tok , granulite , Julian Giordani , orogeny , Prof Patrice Rey , terrane , Underworld Ben Mather wins People’s Choice Award at #AuScope2021 Conference for volcano video 15 October, 2021 by Dietmar Müller Ben Mather won the People’s Choice Award at the recent #AuScope2021 Conference for his fantastic presentation explaining the evolution of seafloor volcanoes off the eastern Australian coast.

Mountain building, arc–continent collisions and clustering of continents in the tropics have all been invoked as controlling the weathering flux, with arcs also acting as a major contributor of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. However, these processes have … Read more… Categories News 2021 , Plate Tectonics & Geodynamics , Publications 2021 Tags climate , tectonic , volcanic arc , weathering Geodynamic models link enigmatic intraplate volcanism in Eastern Asia to subduction history and upper mantle upwellings 25 May, 2021 by Dietmar Müller In Eastern Asia, Jurassic and Cretaceous intraplate volcanism and magmatism differ in their spatial distribution and composition. A combination of plate kinematic and geodynamic models provides clues for their causes.

While it is clear that the gateway was closed by ~2.8 Ma, recent studies based on geological and marine molecular evidence have suggested an earlier closing time of early to mid-Miocene.

Previous studies have determined ocean basin volume changes from plate tectonic reconstructions since the Mesozoic; however, these studies have not considered a … Read more… Categories Data & Models , GPlates , News 2020 , Plate Reconstructions , Plate Tectonics & Geodynamics , Publications 2020 , Research , Resources Tags Dr Joanne Whittaker , Dr Maria Seton , Dr Nicky Wright , Dr Simon Williams , Prof Dietmar Müller A Quantitative Tomotectonic Plate Reconstruction of Western North America and the Eastern Pacific Basin 30 September, 2020 by Maria Seton Abstract: Plate reconstructions since the breakup of Pangaea are mostly based on the preserved spreading history of ocean basins, within absolute reference frames that are constrained by a combination of age-progressive hotspot tracks and palaeomagnetic data.
