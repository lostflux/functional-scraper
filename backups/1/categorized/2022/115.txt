vedantasociety.net tyag@mit.edu 617.536.5320 + Humanist/atheist/agnostic and ethical programs Chaplain, Greg Epstein Greg M. Epstein serves as the Humanist Chaplain at Harvard and MIT, and as Convenor for Ethical Life at MIT’s ORSEL. He is author of the New York Times Bestselling book, Good Without God.
A Harvard chaplain since 2004, Greg’s 2018 appointment at MIT marked a major career transition. After building a congregation of “atheists, agnostics, and allies” meeting more than 1,000 times between 2013-2018, Greg and colleagues shut the community down in 2018. A decisive factor was Greg’s conclusion that many secular young people he hoped to serve already were already active participants in a kind of congregation — but their community, rather than following a specific creed, could be summed up in a word: “technology.” He is now delighted to help people at a technological institute think about how to live ethically and meaningfully in a technological world; and how to be vulnerable and human when those around us too often expect us to act like impervious machines.
When not having deep discussions with MIT and Harvard affiliates, Greg can be found playing with his young son, planning a weekend family outing with his wife, hosting or appearing on podcasts, or writing. In 2019-2020 Greg was the “Ethicist in Residence” at TechCrunch; in 2021 he is a regular contributor to The Boston Globe. Other bylines include CNN.com, The Washington Post, and Newsweek. He is currently working on a book about technology, religion, and humanism. For more information, see Greg’s LinkTree or find him on Twitter or LinkedIn.
 For a meeting, email Greg from your MIT email address and ask for the link to his Calendly.
