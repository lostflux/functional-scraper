However, their full potential for quantum computing has not yet been realized, owing to the lack of methods with which to link nuclear qubits within a scalable device combined with multi-qubit operations with sufficient fidelity to sustain fault-tolerant quantum computation. Here we demonstrate universal quantum logic operations using a pair of ion-implanted 31 P donor nuclei in a silicon nanoelectronic device. A nuclear two-qubit controlled- Z gate is obtained by imparting a geometric phase to a shared electron spin 4 , and used to prepare entangled Bell states with fidelities up to 94.2(2.7)%. The quantum operations are precisely characterized using gate set tomography (GST) 5 , yielding one-qubit average gate fidelities up to 99.95(2)%, two-qubit average gate fidelity of 99.37(11)% and two-qubit preparation/measurement fidelities of 98.95(4)%. These three metrics indicate that nuclear spins in silicon are approaching the performance demanded in fault-tolerant quantum processors 6.
 We then demonstrate entanglement between the two nuclei and the shared electron by producing a Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger three-qubit state with 92.5(1.0)% fidelity. Because electron spin qubits in semiconductors can be further coupled to other electrons 7 , 8 , 9 or physically shuttled across different locations 10 , 11 , these results establish a viable route for scalable quantum information processing using donor nuclear and electron spins.

 However, the weak coupling poses a challenge for multi-qubit logic operations. Using spin-carrying defects in diamond 14 and silicon carbide 15 , this problem can be addressed by coupling multiple nuclei to a common electron spin, thus creating quantum registers that can sustain small quantum logic operations and error correction 16.
 Exciting progress is being made on linking several such defects via optical photons 17 , 18.
Still missing, however, is a pathway to exploit the atomic-scale dimension of nuclear spin qubits to engineer scalable quantum processors, where densely packed qubits are integrated and operated within a semiconductor chip 19.
 This requires entangling the nuclear qubits with electrons that can either be physically moved or entangled with other nearby electrons. It also requires interspersing the electron–nuclear quantum processing units with spin readout devices 20.
 Here we show experimentally that silicon—the material underpinning the whole of modern digital information technology—is the natural system in which to develop dense nuclear spin-based quantum processors 1.
One-electron–two-nuclei quantum processor The experiments are conducted on a system of two 31 P donor atoms, introduced in an isotopically purified 28 Si substrate by ion implantation (see Methods ). A three-qubit processor is formed by using an electron (e) with spin S = 1/2 (basis states \(|\uparrow \rangle \) , \(|\downarrow \rangle \) ) and two nuclei (Q1, Q2) with spin I = 1/2 (basis states \(|\Uparrow \rangle \) , \(|\Downarrow \rangle \) ). Metallic structures on the surface of the chip provide electrostatic control of the donors, create a single-electron transistor (SET) charge sensor, and deliver microwave and radio-frequency signals through a broadband antenna (Fig.
1a and Extended Data Fig.
1 ). With this set-up, we can perform single-shot electron spin readout 20 , and high fidelity (approximately 99.9%) single-shot quantum nondemolition readout of the nuclear spins 21 , as well as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and electron spin resonance (ESR) 22 on all spins involved (see Methods ).
a , Artist’s impression of a pair of 31 P nuclei (red), asymmetrically coupled to the same electron (blue). The spins are controlled by oscillating magnetic fields (yellow) generated on-chip.
b , Effective-mass calculation of the wavefunction ψ ( y , z ) of the third electron on the 2P cluster. The observed values of hyperfine coupling are well reproduced by assuming a 6.5-nm spacing between the donors.
c , Experimental NMR spectrum of the 31 P nuclei (top) and ESR spectrum of the shared electron (bottom) at B 0 = 1.33 T, along with energy level diagram (right) of the eight-dimensional Hilbert space (spacings not to scale). The spectra yield the hyperfine couplings A 1 ≈ 95 MHz and A 2 ≈ 9 MHz between the electron and the nuclear qubits Q1 and Q2.
d , Implementation of a geometric two-qubit CZ gate. A conditional π phase shift is acquired when a 2π rotation is applied on the electron spin at frequency \({\nu }_{{\rm{e}}|\Downarrow \Downarrow }\) , that is, conditional on the nuclear spins being \(|\Downarrow \Downarrow \rangle \).
 This operation corresponds to the CZ gate on the nuclei when restricted to the electron \(|\downarrow \rangle \) subspace, as indicated by the equivalence symbol ( ≅ ) between the two circuits.
Source data Full size image The ESR spectra in Fig.
1c exhibit four resonances. This means that the ESR frequency depends upon the state of two nuclei, to which the electron is coupled by contact hyperfine interactions A 1 ≈ 95 MHz and A 2 ≈ 9 MHz, with a dependence on the gate potentials caused by the Stark shift (Extended Data Fig.
2 ). We adopt labels where, for instance, \({\nu }_{{\rm{e}}|\Downarrow \Downarrow }\) represents the frequency at which the electron spin undergoes transitions conditional on the two nuclear spin qubits being in the \(|{{\rm{Q}}}_{1}{{\rm{Q}}}_{2}\rangle =|\Downarrow \Downarrow \rangle \) state, and so on. The values of A 1 , A 2 can be independently checked by measuring the frequencies ν Q1|↓ , ν Q2|↓ at which each nucleus responds while the electron is in the \(|\downarrow \rangle \) state ( Supplementary Information section 1 ).The hyperfine-coupled electron could either be the first or the third electron bound to the donor cluster. Since its spin relaxation time T 1e is three orders of magnitude shorter than expected from a one-electron system (Extended Data Fig.
3 ), we interpret the ESR spectrum in Fig.
1c as describing the response of the third electron bound to a 2P donor system.
An effective-mass calculation of the wavefunction of the third electron in a 2P system (see Methods ) reproduces the observed values of A 1 and A 2 by assuming donors spaced 6.5 nm apart, and subjected to an electric field 2 mV nm −1 that pulls the electron wavefunction more strongly towards donor 1 (Fig.
1b ). The 31 P nuclei in this 2P cluster are spaced more widely than those produced by scanning probe lithography 8 , 23 , where the sub-nanometre inter-donor spacing causes a strongly anisotropic hyperfine coupling, which randomizes the nuclear spin state each time the electron is removed from the cluster for spin readout 24.
 Here, instead, the probability of flipping a nuclear spin by electron ionization is of order 10 −6 (Extended Data Fig.
5 ), meaning that our nuclear readout is almost perfectly quantum nondemolition.
Nuclear two-qubit operations We first consider the two 31 P nuclear spins as the qubits of interest. One-qubit logic operations are trivially achieved by NMR pulses 21 (Methods and Extended Data Fig.
4 ), where A 1 ≠ A 2 provides the spectral selectivity to address each qubit individually (Fig.
1c ). Two-qubit operations are less trivial, since the nuclei are not directly coupled to each other (Supplementary Information sections 1 , 9 ). They are, however, hyperfine-coupled to the same electron. This allows the implementation of a geometric two-qubit controlled- Z (CZ) gate 4 , 16.
When a quantum two-level system is made to trace a closed trajectory on its Bloch sphere, its quantum state acquires a geometric phase equal to half the solid angle enclosed by the trajectory 25.
 Figure 1d illustrates how an electron 2π pulse at the frequency \({\nu }_{{\rm{e}}|\Downarrow \Downarrow }\) (see Fig.
1d ) constitutes a nuclear CZ two-qubit gate. Starting from the state \(|\Downarrow \rangle \otimes (|\Downarrow \rangle +|\Uparrow \rangle )/\sqrt{2}\equiv (|\Downarrow \Downarrow \rangle +|\Downarrow \Uparrow \rangle )/\sqrt{2}\) , the electron X 2π pulse at \({\nu }_{{\rm{e}}|\Downarrow \Downarrow }\) introduces a phase factor e iπ = −1 to the \(|\Downarrow \Downarrow \rangle \) branch of the superposition, resulting in the state \((-|\Downarrow \Downarrow \rangle +|\Downarrow \Uparrow \rangle )/\sqrt{2}\equiv |\Downarrow \rangle \otimes (-|\Downarrow \rangle +|\Uparrow \rangle )/\sqrt{2}\) , that is, a rotation of Q2 by 180 degrees around the z axis of its Bloch sphere, which is the output of a CZ operation. Conversely, if the initial state of Q1 were \(|\Uparrow \rangle \) , the pulse at \({\nu }_{{\rm{e}}|\Downarrow \Downarrow }\) would have no effect on the electron, leaving the nuclear qubits unaffected.
A nuclear controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate is obtained by sandwiching the CZ gate between a nuclear −π/2 and π/2 pulse (Extended Data Fig.
6a ). Applying an ESR X 2π pulse at \({\nu }_{{\rm{e}}|\Uparrow \Downarrow }\) transforms the sequence into a zero-CNOT gate, that is, a gate that flips Q2 when Q1 is in the \(|0\rangle \equiv |\Uparrow \rangle \) state (Extended Data Fig.
6b and Supplementary Information section 2 ).
We apply this universal gate set (Fig.
2a ) to produce each of the four maximally entangled Bell states of the two nuclear spins, \(|{{\Phi }}^{\pm }\rangle =(|\Downarrow \Downarrow \rangle \pm |\Uparrow \Uparrow \rangle )/\sqrt{2}\) and \(|{{\Psi }}^{\pm }\rangle =(|\Downarrow \Uparrow \rangle \pm |\Uparrow \Downarrow \rangle )/\sqrt{2}\).
 We reconstruct the full density matrices of the Bell states using maximum likelihood quantum state tomography 26 (Supplementary Information section 3 ). The reconstructed states (Fig.
2f ) have fidelities of up to 94.2(2.7)%, and concurrences as high as 0.93(4), proving the creation of genuine two-qubit entanglement. Here and elsewhere, error bars indicate 1 σ confidence intervals. Bell fidelities and concurrences are calculated without removing state preparation and measurement (SPAM) errors (Extended Data Table 1 ).

Source data Full size image Gate set tomography We used a customized, efficient GST 5 , 27 , 28 analysis (see Methods , Extended Data Figs.
7 – 9 and Supplementary Information sections 4 , 5 , 8 ) to investigate the quality of six logic operations on two nuclear-spin qubits: X π/2 and Y π/2 rotations on Q1 and Q2, an additional Y −π/2 rotation on Q2, and the entangling CZ gate. No two single-qubit operations are ever performed in parallel. GST probes these six logic operations and reconstructs a full two-qubit model for their behaviour. Earlier experiments on electron spins in silicon used randomized benchmarking 29 , 30 to extract a single number for the average fidelity of all logic operations. Characterizing specific gates required ‘interleaved’ randomized benchmarking, which can suffer systematic errors 31 , 32.
 Most importantly, randomized benchmarking does not reveal the cause or nature of the errors. Our GST method enables measuring each gate’s fidelity to high precision, distinguishing the contributions of stochastic and coherent errors, and separating local errors (on the target qubit) from crosstalk errors (on, or coupling to, the undriven spectator qubit).
GST estimates a two-qubit process matrix for each logic operation ( G i : i = 1, …, 6) using maximum likelihood estimation. We represent each G i as the composition of its ideal target unitary process ( \({{\mathbb{G}}}_{i}\) ) with an error process written in terms of a Lindbladian generator ( \({{\mathbb{L}}}_{i}\) ): \({G}_{i}={{\rm{e}}}^{{{\mathbb{L}}}_{i}}{{\mathbb{G}}}_{i}\).
 The error generator of each gate can be written as a linear combination of independent elementary error generators that describe distinct types of error 33.
 Each elementary error generator’s coefficient in \({{\mathbb{L}}}_{i}\) is the rate (per gate) at which that error builds up. Any Markovian error process can be described using just four kinds of elementary error generators: Hamiltonian (H) errors, indexed by a single two-qubit Pauli operator, cause coherent or unitary errors (for example, H ZZ generates a coherent ZZ rotation); Pauli stochastic (S) errors, also indexed by a single Pauli operator, cause probabilistic Pauli errors (for example, S IX causes probabilistic X errors on Q2); Pauli correlation (C) errors; and active (A) errors, indexed by two Pauli operators, describe more exotic errors (see Methods ) that were not detected in this experiment. We found that the behaviour of each gate could be described using just 13–14 elementary error generators: three local S errors and three local H errors acting on each of Q1 and Q2, and 1–2 entangling H errors (discussed in detail below). Extended Data Fig.
8 shows the rates of those errors, along with the process matrices and full error generators used to derive them. To get a higher-level picture of gate quality, we aggregate the rates of related errors (see Methods ) to report total rates of stochastic and coherent errors on each qubit and on the entire two-qubit system. We present two overall figures of merit in Fig.
3a, c : generator infidelity and total error. Generator infidelity is closely related to entanglement infidelity, which accurately predicts average gate performance in realistic large-scale quantum processors and can be compared to fault-tolerance thresholds (see Methods and Supplementary Information section 9 ). Total error is related to diamond norm (see Supplementary Information section 9 ) and estimates worst-case gate performance in any circuit, including structured or periodic circuits. In Fig.
3c , we additionally report the average gate fidelity of each gate on its target to ease comparison of these results with those from the literature.
Process matrices for all six gates were estimated using gate set tomography (GST) and represented as error generators with associated rates.
a , The total error rate of each gate (columns) can be partitioned into coherent (blue) and stochastic (orange) components, then further into components acting on Q1 (left), Q2 (right), and on both at once (wide). Coherent errors are further partitioned into intrinsic (dark) and relational (light), which were assigned to specific gates by fixing a gauge. The generator infidelity of each gate (see Supplementary Information section 9 ) is shown, on the whole two-qubit system (hollow pins) and on its target qubit(s) only (black pins). The total infidelity of the CZ gate is only 0.79(14)%. Single-qubit gates have on-target infidelities of 0.07(3)–0.79(6)%, but display significant crosstalk errors of 0.47(5) – 2.63(8)% on the spectator qubit and unexpected entangling coherent (ZZ) errors.
b , An example process matrix is shown for the CZ gate.
c , Error metrics for each gate are aggregated by type (stochastic, coherent) and support (Q1, Q2, total). Uncertainties in parentheses represent 1 σ confidence intervals. In addition to generator infidelity, each gate’s average gate fidelity on its target qubit(s) is shown, to facilitate comparison with literature.
d , A gauge-invariant representation of relational errors between gates (for example, misalignment of rotation axes) that were assigned to individual gates in a , c by fixing a gauge. Each gate is labelled with its intrinsic coherent (H) and stochastic (S) errors, and edges between two gates show the total amplitude of relational coherent error (misalignment) between them. Large gauge-invariant relational errors between single-qubit gates confirm that the entangling coherent errors observed in a are not an artefact of gauge-fixing.
Source data Full size image The process matrices estimated by GST are not unique. An equivalent representation of the gate set can be constructed by a gauge transformation 5 , 34 in which all process matrices are conjugated by some invertible matrix, G i → MG i M −1.
 Some gate errors, such as over/under-rotations or errors on idle spectator qubits, are nearly unaffected by choice of gauge; they are intrinsic to that gate. But other errors, such as a tilted rotation axis, can be shifted from one gate to another by changing gauge. These relational errors cannot be objectively associated with any particular gate. Recognizing this, we divide coherent errors into intrinsic and relational components (Fig.
3a, c ). Intrinsic errors perturb the eigenvalues of a gate, whereas relational errors perturb its eigenvectors. In Fig.
3a, c we follow standard GST practice by choosing a gauge that makes the gates as close to their targets as possible. This associates relational errors with individual gates, in a way that depends critically on the choice of gauge. But the magnitude of a given relational error between a set of gates is gauge invariant, and Fig.
3d illustrates the total relational error between each pair of gates. In this work, we found evidence only for pairwise relational errors, although more complex multi-gate relational errors are possible.
All six gates achieved on-target fidelities greater than 99%, with infidelities as low as 0.07(3)% on Q1 and 0.68(7)% on Q2. However, we observed substantial crosstalk on the spectator qubit during one-qubit gates, resulting in full logic operations (one-qubit gate and spectator idle operation in parallel) with higher infidelities of 0.68(6)%−3.5(2)%. Remarkably, the infidelity of the CZ gate of 0.79(14)% is almost on par with the single-qubit gates—a rare scenario in multi-qubit systems (Fig.
3a, c ).
SPAM errors were estimated by GST as 1.05(4)% on average, and as low as 0.25(3)% for the \(|\Uparrow \Uparrow \rangle \) state (Extended Data Table 1 ). This is a unique feature of nuclear spin qubits, afforded by the quantum nondemolition nature of the measurement process 21 (Methods and Extended Data Fig.
5 ).
GST provided unambiguous evidence for a surprising relational error: weight-2 (entangling) H ZZ and/or \({{\rm{H}}}_{{{\mathbb{G}}}_{i}[ZZ]}\) coherent errors on each one-qubit gate G i , with amplitudes from 1.8–5.0% (Extended Data Fig.
8 ). These errors are consistent with an intermittent ZZ Hamiltonian during the gate pulses. After ruling out a wide range of possible error channels, we propose that the observed H ZZ error arises from the spurious accumulation of geometric phase by the electron spin, caused by off-resonance leakage of microwave power near the ESR frequencies (Supplementary Information section 9 ). This observation illustrates the diagnostic power of GST, which revealed an error channel we had not anticipated. It also shows the ability of GST to unveil correlated and entangling errors, the detection and prevention of which is of key importance for the realization of fault-tolerant quantum computers 35.
Three-qubit entanglement The nuclear logic gates shown above would not scale beyond a single, highly localized cluster of donors. However, adding the hyperfine-coupled electron qubit yields a scalable heterogeneous architecture. Electron qubits decohere faster (see Extended Data Figs.
3, 4 for a comparison), but admit faster control. If high-fidelity entanglement between electron and nuclear qubits can be created, electron qubits can enable fast coherent communication between distant nuclei (via electron–electron entanglement, or physical shuttling) or serve as high-fidelity ancilla qubits for quantum error correction. To demonstrate this capability, we produce the maximally entangled three-qubit Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger (GHZ) state \(|{\psi }_{{\rm{GHZ}}}\rangle =(|\Uparrow \Uparrow \uparrow \rangle +|\Downarrow \Downarrow \downarrow \rangle \rangle )/\sqrt{2}\) using the pulse sequence shown in Fig.
4a.
 Starting from \(|\Downarrow \Downarrow \downarrow \rangle \) , an NMR Y π/2 pulse at ν Q2|↓ creates a coherent superposition state of nucleus 2, followed by a nuclear zCNOT gate (as in Fig.
2a ) to produce a nuclear | Φ + ⟩ state, and an ESR X π pulse at \({\nu }_{{\rm{e}}|\Downarrow \Downarrow }\) to arrive at | ψ GHZ ⟩.
 Since the ESR frequency directly depends on the state of both nuclei, the latter pulse constitutes a natural three-qubit Toffoli gate, making the creation of three-qubit entanglement particularly simple, as in nitrogen-vacancy centres in diamond 36.
 Executing Toffoli gates on electrons in quantum dots 37 requires more complex protocols, but can be simplified by a combination of exchange and microwave pulses 38.
a , b ,Starting from \(|\Downarrow \Downarrow \downarrow \rangle \) , the first three gates generate an entangled three-qubit GHZ state. All eight state populations are read out ( b ) at each circuit step (red dashed lines), and estimated without correcting for SPAM errors (Supplementary Information section 7 ). The final three gates R ( θ i ) ϕ reverse the operations of the first three if the rotation angles are θ 1 = θ 2 = θ 3 = 0, returning to the initial state in the absence of errors. The two gates that are conditional on Q 2 are composed of multiple pulses (Supplementary Information section 6 ).
c , The coherence between the GHZ components \(|\Downarrow \Downarrow \downarrow \rangle \) and \(|\Uparrow \Uparrow \uparrow \rangle \) is probed by incrementing the phases θ i of the reversal pulses. This induces oscillations at frequency f = 2π( θ 1 + θ 2 + θ 3 ) the amplitude and phase of which correspond to the purity and phase relation between \(|\Downarrow \Downarrow \downarrow \rangle \) and \(|\Uparrow \Uparrow \uparrow \rangle \).
 Solid lines are the fitted sinusoidal curves.
d , Density-matrix extrema of the GHZ state. The state populations of the GHZ components \(|\Downarrow \Downarrow \downarrow \rangle \) and \(|\Uparrow \Uparrow \uparrow \rangle \) at circuit step 3 ( b ) provide the diagonal entries, and the oscillation amplitude and phase ( c ) provide the off-diagonal entries. From these values, the fidelity to the nearest GHZ state is estimated as 92.5(1.0)%, including SPAM.
Source data Full size image Measuring the populations of the eight electron–nuclear states (Supplementary Information section 7 ) after each step confirms the expected evolution from \(|\Downarrow \Downarrow \downarrow \rangle \) to | ψ GHZ ⟩ (Fig.
4b ). The evolution can be undone by applying the sequence in reverse, yielding a return probability to \(|\Downarrow \Downarrow \downarrow \rangle \) of 89.6(9)%, including SPAM errors. As in the two-qubit case, measuring the populations is a useful sanity check but does not prove multipartite entanglement, which requires knowing the off-diagonal terms of the density matrix ρ GHZ = | ψ GHZ ⟩ ⟨ ψ GHZ |.
Standard tomography methods require measuring the target state in different bases, obtained by rotating the qubits prior to measurement. However, the superposition of \(|\Downarrow \Downarrow \downarrow \rangle \) and \(|\Uparrow \Uparrow \uparrow \rangle \) dephases at a rate dominated by the electron dephasing time \({T}_{2{\rm{e}}}^{\ast }\approx 100{\rm{\mu }}{\rm{s}}\) (Extended Data Fig.
3 ), which is only marginally longer than the nuclear spin operation time of approximately 10–20 μs. Therefore, the GHZ state will have dephased considerably by the time it is projected onto each measurement basis.
We circumvent this problem by adopting a tomography method that minimizes the time spent in the GHZ state. An extension of a method first introduced for the measurement of electron–nuclear entanglement in spin ensembles 39 , it is related to the parity scan commonly used in trapped ions 40 and superconducting circuits 41.
 We repeat the reversal of the GHZ state (Fig.
4b ) N = 100 times, each time introducing phase shifts θ 1,2,3 to the rotation axes of the three reversal pulses, with θ 1 = 3 θ 2 = 9 θ 3 = 9 N /125. The return probability to \(|\Downarrow \Downarrow \downarrow \rangle \) oscillates with N ; the amplitude and phase of the oscillations yield the off-diagonal matrix element \(\langle \Downarrow \Downarrow \downarrow |{\rho }_{{\rm{GHZ}}}|\Uparrow \Uparrow \uparrow \rangle ={\rho }_{18}\).
Since the ideal ρ GHZ has nonzero elements only on its four corners, the populations ρ 11 , ρ 88 and the coherence ρ 18 are sufficient to determine the GHZ state fidelity ℱ GHZ = 92.5(1.0)%. Also here, SPAM errors remain included in total infidelity. By comparison, an 88% GHZ state fidelity has been reported in a triple quantum dot after removing SPAM errors, whereas the uncorrected fidelity is 45.8% 37.
 This highlights the drastic effect of SPAM of multi-qubit entanglement, and the robustness of our system against such errors. The different coherence and operation timescales for electron and nuclei need not be an obstacle for the use of such entangled states in scaled-up architectures, because all further entangling or shuttling operations between electrons will occur on approximately 1-μs time scales.
Outlook The demonstration of one-qubit, two-qubit and SPAM errors at or below the 1% level highlight the potential of nuclear spins in silicon as a credible platform for fault-tolerant quantum computing. An often-quoted example, based on surface code quantum error correction, sets a fault-tolerance threshold of 0.56% for the entanglement infidelity of one- and two-qubit gates and the SPAM errors 6.
Several avenues are available to harness the high-fidelity operations demonstrated here. Replacing the 31 P donors with the higher-spin group-V analogues such as 123 Sb ( I = 7/2) or 209 Bi ( I = 9/2) would provide access to a much larger Hilbert space in which to encode quantum information. For example, a cluster of two 123 Sb donors contains the equivalent of six qubits in the nuclear spins, plus an electron qubit. An error-correcting code can be efficiently implemented in high-spin nuclei 42 , where our method would provide a pathway for universal operations between the logical qubits encoded in each nucleus.
Moving to heavier group-V donors also enables the electrical control of the nuclear spins 43.
 Combined with the electrical drive of the electron–nuclear ‘flip-flop’ transition 44 , this implies the ability to control electron and nuclei by purely electrical means. In a two-donor system as shown here, the entangling CZ gate could similarly be obtained by an electrical 2π pulse on a flip-flop transition.
The electron–nuclear entanglement we have demonstrated can be harnessed to scale up beyond a pair of nuclei coupled to the same electron. Neighbouring donor electrons can be entangled via exchange interaction by performing controlled-rotation resonant gates 9 or \(\sqrt{{\rm{SWAP}}}\) gates 8.
 Wider distances could be afforded by physically shuttling the electron across lithographic quantum dots 45 , 46 , while preserving the quantum information encoded in it 11.
 Our methods would apply equally to isoelectronic nuclear spin centres such as 73 Ge and 29 Si, where it has been shown that the nuclear qubit coherence is preserved while shuttling the electron across neighbouring dots 10.
 Furthermore, electron spins can mediate the coherent interaction between nuclear spin qubits and microwave photons 47 , 48.
 Recent experiments on electron spin qubits in silicon report one- and two-qubit gate fidelities above 99% 49 , 50.
 Therefore, the fidelity of electron qubit operations will not constitute a bottleneck for the performance of electron–nuclear quantum processors. These examples illustrate the importance of universal high-fidelity two-qubit operations with nuclear spins in a platform such as silicon, which can simultaneously host nuclear and electron spin qubits, lithographic quantum dots and dense readout and control devices 19.
Methods Device fabrication The quantum processor is fabricated using methods compatible with standard silicon metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) processes. We start from a high-quality silicon substrate (p-type ⟨ 100 ⟩ ; 10–20 Ω cm), on top of which a 900-nm-thick epilayer of isotopically enriched 28 Si has been grown using low-pressure chemical vapour deposition (LPCVD). The residual 29 Si concentration is 730 ppm. Heavily doped n + regions for ohmic contacts and lightly doped p regions for leakage prevention are defined by thermal diffusion of phosphorus and boron, respectively. A 200-nm-thick SiO 2 field oxide is grown in a wet oxidation furnace. In the centre of the device, an opening of 20 μm × 40 μm is etched in the field oxide using HF acid. Immediately after, an 8-nm-thick, high-quality dry SiO 2 gate oxide is grown in this opening. In preparation for ion implantation, a 90 nm × 100 nm aperture is opened in a PMMA mask using electron-beam lithography (EBL). The samples are implanted with P + ions at an acceleration voltage of 10 keV per ion. During implantation the samples were tilted by 8 degrees and the fluence was set at 1.4 × 10 12 cm −2.
 Donor activation and implantation damage repair is achieved through the process of a rapid thermal annealing (5 s at 1,000 °C). The gate layout is patterned around the implantation region in three EBL steps, each followed by aluminium thermal deposition (25 nm thickness for layer 1; 50 nm for layer 2; 100 nm for layer 3). Immediately after each metal deposition, the sample is exposed to a pure, low pressure (100 mtorr) oxygen atmosphere to form an Al 2 O 3 layer, which electrically insulated the overlapping metal gates. At the last step, samples are annealed in a forming gas (400 °C, 15 min, 95% N 2 /5% H 2 ) aimed at passivating the interface traps.
Experimental set-up The device was wire-bonded to a gold-plated printed circuit board and placed in a copper enclosure. The enclosure was placed in a permanent magnet array 51 , producing a static magnetic field of 1.33 T at the device (see Extended Data Fig.
1 for field orientation). The board was mounted on a cryogen-free dilution refrigerator (Bluefors BF-LD400), reaching a base temperature of 14 mK, and the effective electron temperature was ~150 mK.
d.c. bias voltages were applied to all gates using voltage sources (Stanford Research Systems (SRS) SIM928). A room-temperature resistive combiner was used for the fast donor gates (Extended Data Fig.
1 ) to add d.c. voltages to a.c. signals produced by the LeCroy Arbstudio 1104, which then passed through an 80 MHz low-pass filter; all other gates passed through a 20 Hz low-pass filter. All filtering takes place at the mixing chamber plate. The wiring includes graphite-coated flexible coaxial cables to reduce triboelectric noise 52.
Microwave pulses to induce ESR transitions were applied to an on-chip broadband antenna 53 using a vector microwave source (Rohde & Schwarz SGS100A) combined with an upconverter (SGU100A). The microwave carrier frequency remained fixed at 37.1004125 GHz, whereas the output frequency was varied within a pulse sequence by mixing it with a radio-frequency (RF) signal using double-sideband modulation, that is, by applying RF pulses to the in-phase port of the SGS100A IQ mixer (the quadrature port was terminated by a 50-Ω load). The carrier frequency was chosen such that whenever one sideband tone was resonant with an ESR pulse, the second sideband was off-resonant with all other ESR frequencies. To suppress microwave signals when not needed, 0 V was applied to the in-phase port of the IQ mixer. Under these circumstances, the carrier frequency is expected to be suppressed by 35 dB, according to the source data sheet. The RF pulses used for double-sideband modulation were generated by one of the two channels of the arbitrary waveform generator (Agilent 81180A); the second channel delivered RF pulses to the microwave antenna to drive NMR transitions. The microwave signal for ESR and RF signal for NMR were combined in a diplexer (Marki Microwave DPX-1721).
The SET current passed through a transimpedance amplifier (Femto DLPCA-200; 10 7 V A −1 gain, 50-kHz bandwidth), followed by a post-amplifier (SRS SIM910 JFET; 10 2 V V −1 gain), analogue filter (SRS SIM965; 50 kHz cut-off low-pass Bessel filter), and acquired via a PCI digitizer card (AlazarTech ATS9440). The instruments were triggered by a SpinCore PulseBlasterESR-PRO. The measurements instruments were controlled by Python code using the quantum measurement software packages QCoDeS and SilQ.
System Hamiltonian The static Hamiltonian of our combined electron-nuclei system is $${H}_{{\rm{s}}}=-{\gamma }_{{\rm{e}}}{B}_{0}{\hat{S}}_{z}-{\gamma }_{{\rm{n}}}{B}_{0}({\hat{I}}_{1,z}+{\hat{I}}_{2,z})+{A}_{1}{\bf{S}}\cdot {{\bf{I}}}_{1}+{A}_{2}{\bf{S}}\cdot {{\bf{I}}}_{2},$$ where γ e ≈ −27.97 GHz T −1 is the electron gyromagnetic ratio 54 , γ n ≈ 17.23 MHz T −1 is the nuclear gyromagnetic ratio 55 , \({\bf{S}}=[{\hat{S}}_{x},{\hat{S}}_{y},{\hat{S}}_{z}]\) are the electron spin operators, and \({{\bf{I}}}_{i}=[{\hat{I}}_{i,x},{\hat{I}}_{i,y},{\hat{I}}_{i,z}]\) are the nuclear spin operators for nucleus i ∈ 1, 2. The static magnetic field B 0 = 1.33 T is aligned along \(\hat{z}\) , and A 1 ≈ 95 MHz ( A 2 ≈ 9 MHz) is the hyperfine interaction strength between the electron and nucleus 1 (2).
An a.c. drive applied to the microwave line is used to induce transitions between nuclear spin states and between electron spin states. The drive predominantly modulates the transverse magnetic field as $${H}_{{\rm{RF}}}(t)=-{\gamma }_{{\rm{e}}}{{\bf{B}}}_{1}\cdot {\bf{S}}\,\sin \,\omega t-{\gamma }_{{\rm{n}}}{{\bf{B}}}_{1}\cdot ({\hat{I}}_{1}+{\hat{I}}_{2})\sin \,\omega t,$$ where B 1 is the oscillating magnetic field strength, primarily aligned along \(\hat{y}\).
Electron spin readout An electron spin readout is realized through the spin-to-charge conversion 56 , 57.
 This method utilizes a single-electron transistor (SET) as both a charge sensor and an electron reservoir. The electron spin \(|\downarrow \rangle \) and \(|\uparrow \rangle \) states are separated by the Zeeman energy, which scales linearly with the external magnetic field. Thermal broadening of the SET at 100 mK is much smaller than the Zeeman splitting of two electron spin states. This means that, at the read position, the donor electron spin-down state faces only occupied levels in the SET island (tunnelling is prohibited) and the spin-up state faces only unoccupied states and can freely tunnel out the SET island. This event will shift the energy ladder in the SET island, bringing it out of the Coulomb blockade, thus causing a burst in the current. This burst will last until \(|\downarrow \rangle \) electron tunnels to the donor. If the electron has been projected to the \(|\downarrow \rangle \) state then no change in the SET current will be recorded, as the electron cannot tunnel to the SET island. At the end of each read phase the electron spin is reinitialized in \(|\downarrow \rangle \) for the next single shot cycle. The fidelity of single-shot electron readout and \(|\downarrow \rangle \) initialization by spin-dependent tunnelling is ~80% in this device. However, we further increase the initialization fidelity by letting the electron thermalize to the lattice temperature for a time ≫ T 1e (Fig.
3b ) before triggering further operations.
Nuclear spin readout and initialization The readout of the two nuclear spin qubits is an extension of the well known method developed for a single donor 21 , based on the excitation of the electron bound to the nuclei, conditional on a particular nuclear state, followed by electron spin readout 20.
 The same method is used to initialize the nuclei in a known state.
In the present system, consisting of an electron coupled to two 31 P donors with different hyperfine couplings A 1 ≫ A 2 , we find four well separated electron spin resonance (ESR) frequencies (Fig.
1c ), conditional on the \(|\Downarrow \Downarrow \rangle \) , \(|\Downarrow \Uparrow \rangle \) , \(|\Uparrow \Downarrow \rangle \) , \(|\Uparrow \Uparrow \rangle \) nuclear states. An electron in the \(|\downarrow \rangle \) state is initially drawn from a cold charge reservoir onto the donor cluster (independently of nuclear states). We then apply a microwave π pulse at a particular ESR frequency, for instance \({\nu }_{{\rm{e}}|\Downarrow \Downarrow }\) corresponding to the \(|\Downarrow \Downarrow \rangle \) nuclear spin state, and then measure the electron spin. If it is found in the \(|\uparrow \rangle \) state, then the nuclear spins are projected to the \(|\Downarrow \Downarrow \rangle \) state. If the electron is \(|\downarrow \rangle \) (that is, the pulse at \({\nu }_{{\rm{e}}|\Downarrow \Downarrow }\) failed to flip it to \(|\uparrow \rangle \) ), the nuclear spins are projected to the subspace orthogonal to the \(|\Downarrow \Downarrow \rangle \) state. This constitutes a nuclear spins single-shot readout, with a fidelity given by the product of the electron single-shot readout fidelity (typically ~80%) and the electron π-pulse fidelity ( ≫ 99%).
This nuclear readout is a projective, approximately quantum nondemolition (QND) process 21.
 The ideal QND measurement relies on the observable I z to commute with the Hamiltonian H int describing an interaction between the observable and the measurement apparatus [ I z , H int ] = 0 (ref.
58 ). In our case the hyperfine terms A 1 S z I z 1 and A 2 S z I z 2 constitute H int.
 The observation of nuclear spin quantum jumps originating from the electron measurement by spin-dependent tunnelling (ionization shock) hints at a deviation from QND nature of the readout process 21.
 It implies the presence of terms of the form A ∥ / S ( S + I − + S − I + ) in the hyperfine coupling, and possibly additional anisotropic terms, which do not commute with I z.
 In our experiment, the deviation from the ideal QND measurement is extremely small, of order 10 −6 , as shown in Extended Data Fig.
5.
We exploit the near-perfect QND nature of the nuclear spin readout by repeating the cycle (load |↓ ⟩ –ESR π pulse–electron readout) between 7 and 40 times, to substantially increase the nuclear single-shot readout fidelity. This is the fundamental reason why our average SPAM errors are ~1% (Extended Data Table 1 ), and we have thus reported Bell and GHZ state fidelities without removing SPAM errors from the estimate.
ESR and NMR calibration Gate calibration Both the one-qubit NMR gates and the two-qubit ESR gate were iteratively calibrated using a combination of GST and other tuning methods. Rabi flops were first used to obtain roughly calibrated one-qubit NMR gates. Next, one-qubit GST was repeatedly used to identify and correct error contributions such as over-/under-rotations and detunings. Other routines such as the repeated application of gates were performed in between GST measurements to independently verify the improvements to one-qubit gate fidelities of GST. The calibrated NMR π/2-pulse duration of Q1 (Q2) is 12.0 μs (25.3 μs). The discrepancy between the two durations is largely due to the hyperfine interaction enhancing the Rabi frequency of Q1 and reducing the Rabi frequency of Q2, combined with line reflections and filtering.
For the geometric two-qubit gate based upon an electron 2π pulse, we found that a trivial calibration using Rabi flops already gave a near-optimal result. GST was then used for fine-tuning and for the detection of small error contributions such as a minor frequency shift. The calibrated ESR 2π pulse duration of the CZ gate is 1.89 μs at an output power of 20 dBm.
Periodic frequency recalibration To keep the system tuned throughout the measurements, the NMR frequencies ν Q1|↓ and ν Q2|↓ and ESR frequency ν e|↓↓ were calibrated every ten circuits. The ESR frequency was calibrated by measuring the ESR spectrum and selecting the frequency of the ESR peak. The NMR frequencies were measured by a variant of the Ramsey sequence, consisting of an X π/2 and Y π/2 separated by a wait time τ.
 An off-resonant RF pulse was applied during the wait time to mitigate any frequency shift caused by the absence of an RF drive. Since nuclear readout has a near-unity fidelity, this measurement should result in a nuclear flipping probability P flip = 0.5 if the RF frequency f RF matches the average NMR frequency f NMR throughout the measurement. Therefore, any deviation of P flip from 0.5 provides a direct estimate of the frequency mismatch Δ f = f NMR − f RF = arcsin(2 P flip − 1)/(2π τ ), provided that |Δ f / τ | < 0.25. A higher τ more accurately estimates Δ f , whereas a lower τ results in the condition |Δ f / τ | < 0.25 being valid for a broader range of Δ f.
 The NMR recalibration sequence iteratively increased the wait time τ = 40 μs → 100 μs → 160 μs to ensure that the condition |Δ f / τ | < 0.25 remains satisfied while increasing the accuracy at which the NMR frequency is estimated. For each τ , the NMR frequency was estimated by repeating this sequence and updating the RF frequency until P flip fell within the range [0.4, 0.6].
Measurement overhead Instrument set-ups and calibration routines add a substantial overhead to the GST measurements. An estimate of this overhead can be obtained by comparing the total measurement duration to the duration of a single pulse sequence. The 2Q GST measurement shown in Fig.
3 was acquired over 61 h, duSring which 300–503 shots were acquired for each of the 1,593 circuits. This results in an average duration of 340 ms per GST pulse sequence iteration. Compared to the average pulse sequence duration of around 121 ms, this corresponds to an overhead of 185%.
Effective-mass theory simulations of the hyperfine interaction To simulate the wavefunction of the third electron in the 2P system, the effective-mass theory (EMT) model of the neutral 2P system in ref.
59.
 is extended in a mean-field approach.
For short donor separations, the two inner electrons are tightly bound in a magnetically inactive singlet orbital. The third electron then only interacts with the inner ones to the extent that it experiences the Coulomb repulsion of their fixed charge distribution $$V({\bf{r}})=\frac{{e}^{2}}{4{\rm{\pi }}{{\epsilon }}_{{\rm{Si}}}}\int \frac{{\rho }_{{\rm{S}}}({\bf{r}}{\prime} )}{|{\bf{r}}{\prime} -{\bf{r}}|}{{\rm{d}}}^{3}{\bf{r}}{\prime} .$$ Here, e is the electron charge, ϵ Si the dielectric constant in silicon and ρ S ( r ′) is the charge density of the tightly bound electrons found in ref.
59 The third electron is then effectively described by the sum of the 2P EMT Hamiltonian in an electric field 59 and the corresponding mean-field potential in equation ( 3 ).
Here, only 2P configurations along the [100] crystal axis with distances d ≤ 7 nm and realistic fields E ≤ 2 mV nm −1 are considered. In this regime the inter-donor exchange dominates the on-site exchange and the mean-field approach is justified.
The chosen basis is a combination of two STO-3G 59 orbitals, one variationally optimized at d = 0.5 nm and the other at d = 7 nm.
To compute the hyperfine interaction strength, the electron density at the nucleus is rescaled by a bunching factor of 440 (ref.
60 ). The experimentally found hyperfine configuration is found for donors spaced 6.5 nm apart, and subjected to an electric field 2 mV nm −1.
Gate set tomography experiments We designed a customized GST experiment for a set of six logic gates: X π/2 and Y π/2 rotations on each qubit, an additional Y −π/2 rotation on Q2, and the symmetric CZ gate between them. A basic two-qubit GST experiment for this gate set comprises a list of quantum circuits defined by: (1) choosing a set of 75 short ‘germ’ circuits that, when repeated, collectively amplify every error rate; (2) repeating each germ several times to times to form ‘germ power’ circuits the lengths of which are approximately L = 1, 2, 4, …, L max ; and (3) prefacing and appending each germ power with each of 16 ‘preparation fiducial’ circuits and each of 11 ‘measurement fiducial’ circuits. We used L max = 8, yielding a set of 20,606 circuits (this is not a simple multiplication because germ circuits with depth >1 do not appear at shorter L ). We eliminated 92% of these circuits using two techniques from ref.
5.
 First, we identified a subset of 18 germs that amplify any dominant errors in each gate (if L max was very large, subdominant errors would get echoed away by dominant errors). This yielded a total of 50 germ powers. Second, for the L > 1 germ powers, we identified and eliminated pairs of fiducial circuits that provided redundant information. This trimmed the circuits per germ power from 176 to as few as 16, and the total number of circuits from 8,800 to just 1,592. Each of those circuits was repeated 300–500 times to gather statistics. We used maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) implemented in the pyGSTi software 61 , 62 to estimate 16 × 16 two-qubit process matrices { G i : i = 1, …, 6} for all six operations.
Constructing and selecting reduced models Process matrices are a comprehensive, but not especially transparent, representation of gate errors. So we used each gate’s ideal target (unitary) operation \({{\mathbb{G}}}_{i}\) to construct an error generator 33 \({{\mathbb{L}}}_{i}=\,\log ({G}_{i}{{\mathbb{G}}}_{i}^{-1})\) that presents the same information more usefully. Representing noisy gates this way enables us to split each gate’s total error into parts that act on Q1 only, Q2 only, or both qubits together—and then further into coherent and stochastic errors—to reveal those errors’ sources and consequences. It also enables the construction of simple, efficient ‘reduced models’ for gate errors, by identifying swaths of elementary error generators whose rates are indistinguishable from zero.
Pinning the coefficients of k elementary error generators to zero yields a reduced model with k fewer parameters, whose likelihood ( ℒ ) can be found by MLE. We evaluate the statistical significance of error rates that were pinned by seeing how much ℒ declines. If a given error’s true rate is zero, then pinning it to zero in the model reduces 2log ℒ , on average, by 1 (ref.
63 ). So when we pin k rates, we compute the ‘evidence ratio’ r = 2Δlog ℒ / k , where Δlog ℒ is the difference between the two models’ likelihood 64.
 If r ≤ 1, the pinned rates are strictly negligible; if r ≤ 2, then the smaller model is preferred by Akaike’s information criterion (AIC); 65 other criteria (for example, the Bayesian BIC) impose higher thresholds. We used a slightly higher threshold and chose the smaller model whenever r ≤ 5. Using this methodology, we constructed a model that describes the data well, in which just 83 (out of 1,440) elementary errors’ rates are nonzero.
The rates of all the un-pinned elementary errors form a vector describing the noisy model. In general, un-physical gauge degrees of freedom 5 will give rise to a foliation of the model space into gauge manifolds on which the log-likelihood is constant. In our analysis, we work in the limit of small errors and gauge transformations where the space is approximately linear, and identify the subspace that is gauge invariant. We are able to construct a basis for the gauge-invariant subspace whose elements correspond to relational or intrinsic errors and have a definite type (H, S or A), allowing us to decompose the model’s total error as shown in Fig.
3.
Extended Data Fig.
8 presents each gate’s 13–14 nonzero elementary error rates after projecting the error vector onto the gauge-invariant subspace (column 3), along with the process matrices (column 1) and error generators (column 2) from which they are derived. Here and elsewhere, error bars are 1 σ confidence intervals computed using the Hessian of the log-likelihood function.
Aggregated error rates and metrics Our GST analysis aims to identify specific gate errors and understand how these errors affect the overall performance of our system. It begins with the raw output of GST—rates of elementary errors on gates. We aggregate these error rates in different ways, yielding each gate’s total error and infidelity, and partitioning those metrics into their components on Q1 or Q2 or both qubits together, in order to summarize different aspects of system performance. We additionally report average gate fidelities to facilitate comparison with the literature.
Gate errors, by definition, cause unintended changes in the state of the system. S error generators produce stochastic errors that transfer probability to erroneous states; H generators produce coherent errors that transfer amplitude to erroneous states. We can interpret the rate of an error generator, to first order, as the amount of erroneous probability (denoted ϵ for S generators) or amplitude (denoted θ for H generators) transferred by a single use of the gate when acting on one half of a maximally entangled state.
It is useful to group similar errors together and aggregate their rates. We classify and combine error generators according to: Their type (H or S), Their support (Q1, Q2 or joint), Whether they are intrinsic to a single gate, or relational between gates (H errors only; relational S errors were negligible).
The elementary error generators described in the main text have definite type and support. For example, the H XI generator has type H and support on Q1. Any error generator on a given gate is intrinsic to that gate if it commutes with the gate, and relational otherwise. For example, if single-qubit X π/2 and Y π/2 gates produce rotations around axes that are separated by only 89° instead of 90°, then either gate can be considered perfect at the cost of assigning a 1° tilt error to the other gate. This error can be moved between the two gates by a gauge transformation M that rotates both gates by 1° around the Z -axis. This error is purely relational; it cannot be assigned definitively to one gate or the other, but can be unambiguously observed in circuits containing both gates.
To divide each gate’s errors into intrinsic and relational components, we represent the gate’s error generator as a vector in a space spanned by the H and S elementary error generators. Error generators that commute with the target gate form a subspace that is invariant under gauge transformations. The error generator’s projection onto this space is its intrinsic component. Error generators in the complement of the intrinsic subspace are relational—they can be changed or eliminated by gauge transformations—and the projection of the gate’s error generator onto this complement is its relational component.
To construct aggregated error metrics, we start by aggregating H and S rates separately. They add in different ways, because H error rates correspond to amplitudes whereas S error rates correspond to probabilities. Rates of S generators add directly ( ϵ agg = ∑ i ϵ i ), whereas rates of H generators add in quadrature ( \({\theta }_{{\rm{agg}}}={({\sum }_{i}{\theta }_{i}^{2})}^{1/2}\) ). Combining H and S error rates into a single metric is trickier—there is no unique way to do so because the impact of coherent errors depends on how they interfere over the course of a circuit. We therefore consider two quantities: total error, ϵ tot = ϵ agg + θ agg , and generator infidelity, \(\hat{{\epsilon }}={{\epsilon }}_{{\rm{agg}}}+{\theta }_{{\rm{agg}}}^{2}.\) Total error approximates the maximal rate at which gate errors could add up in any circuit, whereas infidelity quantifies the same errors’ average impact in a random circuit.
Both of these metrics appear in Fig.
3 , where in Fig.
3a, b, d we report aggregated error rates that partition the overall error in various ways (see the discussion in Supplementary Information section 10). We report a third metric, the average gate fidelity (AGF) on each gate’s target qubit(s), in Fig.
3c and in the Abstract to aid comparison with other published results. The on-target AGF provides an overall (and gauge-dependent) measure of the average performance of a gate when acting only on the target qubit(s). For a gate targeting Q1, it is defined as: $${\bar{{\epsilon }}}^{({\rm{Q}}1)}=1-\frac{1}{2}\int {\rm{d}}\psi \langle \psi |{{\rm{tr}}}_{{\rm{Q}}2}[{{\rm{e}}}^{{\mathbb{L}}}(|\psi \rangle \langle \psi |\otimes {\mathbb{1}})]|\psi \rangle $$ For a two-qubit gate, the on-target AGF is simply the AGF of the two-qubit operation: $$\bar{{\epsilon }}=1-\int d\psi \langle \psi |{{\rm{e}}}^{{\mathbb{L}}}(|\psi \rangle \langle \psi |)|\psi \rangle ,$$ In both cases, d ψ is the Haar measure (over one-qubit states in equation ( 4 ) and over two-qubit states in equation ( 5 )) and \({\mathbb{L}}\) is the error generator of the gate. Although AGF is provided for comparison to the literature, it is not a good predictor of performance in general circuits (see Supplementary Information section 9 ), and when we use the unqualified term ‘fidelity’, it always denotes generator fidelity, \(\hat{{\epsilon }}\).
 Supplementary Information section 9 includes an extensive discussion of overall gate error metrics and their relationships.

Extended data figures and tables Extended Data Fig. 1 Device layout.
Scanning electron micrograph of a device identical to the one used in this experiment.
31 P donor atoms are implanted in the region marked by the orange rectangle, using a fluence of 1.4 × 10 12 cm −2 which results in a most probable inter-donor spacing of approximately 8 nm. Four metallic gates are fabricated around the implantation region, and used to modify the electrochemical potential of the donors. A nearby SET, formed using the SET top gate and barrier gates, enables charge sensing of a single donor atom, as well as its electron spin through spin-to-charge conversion (Methods). The tunnel coupling between the donors and SET is tuned by the rate gate situated between the SET and donor implant region. A nearby microwave (MW) antenna is used for ESR and NMR of the donor electron and nuclear spins, respectively.
Extended Data Fig. 2 Electrical tunability of the hyperfine interaction and the electron gyromagnetic ratio.
a , Map of the SET current as a function of SET gate and fast donor gates (pulsed jointly). The white dashed line indicates the location in gate space where the 2P donor cluster changes its charge state. The third, hyperfine-coupled electron is present on the cluster in the region to the right of the line. Electron spin readout is performed at the location indicated by the pink star.
b , ESR spectrum of the electron bound to the 2P cluster, acquired while the system was tuned within the blue dashed rectangle in a.
 The hyperfine couplings A 1 , A 2 are extracted from ESR frequencies as shown, namely \({A}_{1}=({\nu }_{{\rm{e}}|\Uparrow \Downarrow }+{\nu }_{{\rm{e}}|\Uparrow \Uparrow })/2-({\nu }_{{\rm{e}}|\Downarrow \Downarrow }+{\nu }_{{\rm{e}}|\Downarrow \Uparrow })/2\) ; \({A}_{2}={\nu }_{{\rm{e}}|\Uparrow \Uparrow }-{\nu }_{{\rm{e}}|\Uparrow \Downarrow }\).
c , d , Extracted hyperfine couplings within the marked area. The data show that A 1 decreases and A 2 increases upon moving the operation point towards higher gate voltages and away from the donor readout position.
e , A small change is also observed in the sum of the two hyperfine interactions A t = A 1 + A 2.
f , Electrical modulation (Stark shift) of the electron gyromagnetic ratio γ e , extracted from the shift of the average of the hyperfine-split electron resonances. The ESR frequencies can be tuned with fast donor gates at the rate of \(\Delta {\nu }_{{\rm{e}}|\Uparrow \Uparrow }=0.3{{\rm{MHzV}}}^{-1}\) ; \(\Delta {\nu }_{{\rm{e}}|\Uparrow \Downarrow }=5.2{{\rm{MHzV}}}^{-1}\) ; \(\Delta {\nu }_{{\rm{e}}|\Downarrow \Uparrow }=7.6{{\rm{MHzV}}}^{-1}\) ; \(\Delta {\nu }_{{\rm{e}}|\Downarrow \Downarrow }=2.4{{\rm{MHzV}}}^{-1}\).
Extended Data Fig. 3 Coherence metrics of the electron spin qubit.
The columns correspond to the nuclear configurations \(|\Downarrow \Downarrow \rangle \) , \(|\Downarrow \Uparrow \rangle \) , \(|\Uparrow \Downarrow \rangle \) , \(|\Uparrow \Uparrow \rangle \) , respectively. All measurements start with the electron spin initialized in the \(|\downarrow \rangle \) state. Error bars are 1 σ confidence intervals.
a , Electron Rabi oscillations. The measurements were performed by applying a resonant ESR pulse of increasing duration. The different Rabi frequencies f Rabi on each resonance are probably due to a frequency-dependent response of the on-chip antenna and the cable connected to it.
b , Electron spin-lattice relaxation times T 1e.
 Measurements were obtained by first adiabatically inverting the electron spin to \(|\uparrow \rangle \) , followed by a varying wait time τ before electron readout. The observed relaxation times are nearly three orders of magnitude shorter than typically observed in single-electron, single-donor devices 66 , and even shorter compared to 1e–2P clusters. This strongly suggests that the measured electron is the third one, on top of two more tightly-bound electrons which form a singlet spin state 67.
 We also observe a strong dependence of T 1 e on nuclear spin configuration.
c , Electron dephasing times \({T}_{2{\rm{e}}}^{\ast }\).
 The measurements were conducted by performing a Ramsey experiment—that is, by applying two π/2 pulses separated by a varying wait time τ , followed by electron readout. The Ramsey fringes are fitted to a function of the form \({P}_{\uparrow }(\tau )={C}_{0}+{C}_{1}\,\cos (\Delta \omega \tau +\Delta \phi )\exp [-{(\tau /{T}_{2e}^{\ast })}^{2}]\) , where Δ ω is the frequency detuning and Δ ϕ is a phase offset. The observed \({T}_{2{\rm{e}}}^{\ast }\) times are comparable to previous values for electrons coupled to a single 31 P nucleus.
d , Electron Hahn-echo coherence times \({T}_{2{\rm{e}}}^{{\rm{H}}}\) , obtained by adding a π refocusing pulse to the Ramsey sequence. We also varied the phase of the final π/2 pulse at a rate of one period per τ = (5 kHz) −1 , to introduce oscillations in the spin-up fraction which help improve the fitting. The curves are fitted to the same function used to fit the Ramsey fringes, with fixed Δ ω = 5 kHz. The measured \({T}_{2{\rm{e}}}^{{\rm{H}}}\) times are similar to previous observations for electrons coupled to a single 31 P nucleus.
Extended Data Fig. 4 Nuclear spin coherence times.
Panels in column 1 (2) correspond to nucleus Q1 (Q2). Error bars are 1 σ confidence intervals.
a , Nuclear dephasing times \({T}_{2{\rm{n}}}^{\ast }\) , obtained from a Ramsey experiment. Results are fitted with a decaying sinusoid with fixed exponent factor 2 (see Extended Data Fig.
3 ).
b , Nuclear Hahn-echo coherence times \({T}_{2{\rm{n}}}^{{\rm{H}}}\).
 To improve fitting, oscillations are induced by incrementing the phase of the final π/2 pulse with τ at a rate of one period per (3.5 kHz) −1.
 Results are fitted with a decaying sinusoid with fixed exponent factor 2 (see Extended Data Fig.
3 ).
c , Dependence of \({T}_{2{\rm{n}}}^{{\rm{H}}}\) on the amplitude of an off-resonance pulse. We perform this experiment to study whether a qubit, nominally left idle (or, in quantum information terms, subjected to an identity gate) is affected by the application of an RF pulse to the other qubit, at a vastly different frequency. Here, during the idle times between NMR pulses, an RF pulse is applied at a fixed frequency 20 MHz—far off resonance from both qubits’ transitions—with varying amplitude V RF.
 The red dashed line indicates the applied RF amplitude for NMR pulses throughout the experiment. We observe a slow decrease of \({T}_{2{\rm{n}}}^{{\rm{H}}}\) with increasing V RF.
 This is qualitatively consistent with the observation of large stochastic errors on the idle qubit, as extracted by the GST analysis in Fig.
3.
Extended Data Fig. 5 Nuclear spin quantum jumps caused by ionization shock.
The electron and nuclear spin readout relies upon spin-dependent charge tunnelling between the donors and the SET island. If the electron tunnels out of the two-donor system, the hyperfine interactions A 1 , A 2 suddenly drop to zero. If A 1 and A 2 include an anisotropic component (for example, due to the non-spherical shape of the electron wavefunction which results in nonzero dipolar fields at the nuclei), the ionization is accompanied by a sudden change in the nuclear spin quantization axes (‘ionization shock’), and can result in a flip of the nuclear spin state. We measure the nuclear spin flips caused by ionization shock by forcibly loading and unloading an electron from the 2P cluster every 0.8 ms.
a , For qubit 1 with A 1 = 95 MHz, the flip rate is \({{\Gamma }}_{1}=2.8\times {10}^{-6}\frac{{N}_{{\rm{flip}}}}{{N}_{{\rm{ion}}}}\).
b , For qubit 2 with A 2 = 9 MHz, the flip rate is \({{\Gamma }}_{2}=4.0\times {10}^{-7}\frac{{N}_{{\rm{flip}}}}{{N}_{{\rm{ion}}}}\).
 This means that the nuclear spin readout via the electron ancilla is almost exactly quantum nondemolition. From this data, we also extract an average time between random nuclear spin flips of 283 seconds for qubit 1, and 2,000 seconds for qubit 2. The extremely low values of Γ —comparable to those observed in single-donor systems—are the reason why we can reliably operate the two 31 P nuclei as high-fidelity qubits.
Extended Data Fig. 6 CNOT and zero-CNOT nuclear two-qubit gates.
We perform Rabi oscillation on the control qubit followed by the application of a , zCNOT or b , CNOT gates. The two qubits are initialized in the \(|\Downarrow \Downarrow \rangle \equiv |11\rangle \) state. We observe the Rabi oscillations of both qubits in phase for zCNOT and out of phase for CNOT. At every odd multiple of π/2 rotation of the control qubit the Bell states are created.
Extended Data Fig. 7 Two-qubit GST.
a , Measurement circuit for the two-qubit GST. A modified version of this circuit has been used for Bell state tomography. The green box prepares the qubit 2 in the \(|\Uparrow \rangle \) state, then the orange box prepares the qubit 1 in the \(|\Uparrow \rangle \) state. The readout step in the blue box (see Methods ) determines whether the \(|\Downarrow \Downarrow \rangle \) state initialization was successful. Only then the record will be saved. The electron spin is prepared in \(|\downarrow \rangle \) during the nuclear spin readout process. Subsequently, the GST sequence is executed. The red box indicates the Q1, Q2 readout step. The total duration of the pulse sequence is 120 ms, of which nuclear spin initialization is 8.6 ms (green and yellow), initial nuclear spin readout is 26.5 ms (blue), 3 ms delay is added for electron initialization (between blue and purple), GST circuit is 10 μs–300 μs (purple), and nuclear readout is 80 ms (orange).
b , Measurement results for individual two-qubit GST circuit. The first 145 circuits estimate the preparation and measurement fiducials, and the subsequent circuits are ordered by increasing circuit depth. At the end of a circuit, there are three situations for the target state populations: 1) the population is entirely in one state, while all others are zero; 2) the population is equally spread over two states, while the other two are zero; 3) the population is equally spread over all four states. The measured state populations for the different circuits therefore congregate around the four bands 0, 0.25, 0.5, and 1, as indicated by black dashed lines.
Extended Data Fig. 8 Estimated gate set, from process matrices to error rates.
Experimental GST data were analysed using pyGSTi to obtain self-consistent maximum likelihood estimates of two-qubit process matrices for all six elementary gates. These are represented (‘Process Matrix’ column) in a gauge that minimizes their average total error, as superoperators in the two-qubit Pauli basis. Green columns indicate positive matrix elements, orange ones are negative. Wireframe sections indicate differences between estimated and ideal (target) process matrices. Those process matrices can be transformed to error generators (‘Error Generator’ column) that isolate those differences, and are zero if the estimated gate equals its target. Each gate’s error generator was decomposed into a sparse sum of Hamiltonian and stochastic elementary error generators 33.
 Those rates are depicted (‘All Error Rates’ column) as contributions to the gate’s total error, with 1 σ uncertainties indicated in parentheses. Each non-vanishing elementary error rate (error generators are denoted ‘H’ or ‘S’ followed by a Pauli operator) is listed, and identified with its role in the total error budget (reproduced from Fig.
3 ). Orange bars indicate stochastic errors, dark blue indicate coherent errors that are intrinsic to the gate, and light blue indicate relational coherent errors that were assigned to this gate. Total height of the blue region indicates the total coherent error, but because coherent error amplitudes add in quadrature, individual components’ heights are proportional to their quadrature.
Extended Data Fig. 9 Simulation of standard and interleaved randomized benchmarking.
All simulated randomized benchmarking experiments used two-qubit Clifford subroutines compiled from the six native gates, requiring (on average) 14.58 individual gate operations per two-qubit Clifford.
a , Standard randomized benchmarking, simulated using the GST-estimated gate set, yields a ‘reference’ decay rate of r r = 22.2(2)%, suggesting an average per-gate error rate of r r /14.58 ≈ 1.5%. 1 σ confidence intervals are indicated in parentheses.
b – f , Simulated interleaved randomized benchmarking for the CZ gate, and one-qubit X π/2 and Y π/2 gates on each qubit, yielded interleaved decay rates r r + r i.
 For each experiment, 1,000 random Clifford sequences were generated, at each of 15 circuit depths m, and simulated using the GST process matrices. Exact probabilities (effectively infinitely many shots of each sequence) were recorded. Inset histograms show the distribution over 1000 random circuits at m = 4. Observed decays are consistent with each gate’s GST-estimated infidelities—for example, 1 − F = 0.79% for the CZ gate ( b ). Performing these exact randomized benchmarking experiments in the lab would have required running 90,000 circuits to estimate a single parameter ( r i ) for each gate to the given precision of ±0.25%. Using fewer (<1,000) random circuits at each m would yield lower precision. GST required only 1,500 circuits to estimate all error rates to the same precision.
