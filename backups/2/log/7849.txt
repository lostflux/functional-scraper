The Flash and the rest of this year’s superhero film flops could only dream of matching Aquaman ‘s $1.148 billion worldwide gross. Can the upcoming sequel, Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom , deliver a turnaround for DC’s movies ahead of the big James Gunn-led reboot? That remains to be seen. However, the first trailer for the film is banking heavily upon the burgeoning bromance between Jason Momoa’s Aquaman/Arthur Curry, and his estranged half-brother, Orm (Patrick Wilson).
Orm was the villain in the original Aquaman , and Arthur had to step up as a hero in order to dethrone his sibling and become the new king of Atlantis. The trailer picks up a considerable amount of time later, with Aquaman married and now the father of a young child. Arthur has also settled into his role as a monarch, but his world comes crashing down on him when Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) returns with a weapon that tips the balance of power in his favor. And Black Manta’s revenge on Aquaman may put the entire world in danger.
Warner Bros. Pictures / Warner Bros. Pictures Presumably, Arthur promised Orm his freedom in return for his assistance against Black Manta. Regardless, Orm is clearly resisting Arthur’s attempts at brotherly bonding even if he grudgingly admits that his half-brother may have what it takes to rule the oceans.
Blink and you’ll miss Amber Heard’s brief appearance in the trailer as Mera, Aquaman’s wife and the mother of his son. This certainly seems like a response to the backlash over Heard’s court battles with her ex-husband, Johnny Depp. But director James Wan has stated that Mera’s diminished part allowed him to focus the film’s story on Arthur and Orm.
‘Aquaman’ review: Jason Momoa delivers a film fit for the King of the Seven Seas Nicole Kidman reprises her role as Arthur and Orm’s mother, Atlanna, alongside Temuera Morrison as Tom Curry, Dolph Lundgren as King Nereus, Randall Park as Dr. Stephen Shin, Vincent Regan as Atlan, Jani Zhao as Stingray, and Indya Moore as Karshon.
Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom will swim into theaters on Friday, December 20.
Editors' Recommendations Jason Momoa will write and star in Chief of War For AppleTV+ Comic Book Movies DC Comics Tech News Entertainment November has been a great month for movies at Netflix, with the premiere of David Fincher's The Killer, and recent box office hits like Insidious: The Red Door and Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse. This week, the new additions include The Impossible, a 2012 survival thriller that has already landed on the list of the 10 most popular movies on Netflix. For younger viewers, Minions is also heating up the charts despite the pending departure of the other films in the franchise at the end of the month.
There's only one holiday weekend left in November, so what's the best way to stay on top of everything new on Netflix? Why, we are, of course. Our list of the best movies on Netflix right now is updated every Friday, even on holiday weekends, so you can easily find something for every movie lover in your life.
Entertainment Summer is long over, and the fall season is in full swing. It's now late 2023, and just about everyone is subscribed to Netflix and Hulu. But would you be surprised if I told you one of the most underrated streaming services around is Tubi? The upstart streamer has tons of new and old TV shows from every decade and every genre imaginable. Want to watch the buzziest series that aired on Max? Tubi has it. Are you feeling nostalgic about that old movie or cartoon you used to watch as a kid in the '80s or '90s? Chances are, Tubi has it.
Tubi has so much content that it can be hard to choose which shows and films are worth your time. Digital Trends is here to help you sort out which ones are worth watching. Even though the streaming service is free, time is valuable, and no one wants to waste it watching subpar content.
Entertainment Rather than waiting for the Thanksgiving holiday weekend, Apple TV+ and Netflix dropped two of their biggest shows of the fall this week. Netflix's The Crown kicked off its sixth and final season with four new episodes, while the Apple TV+ Godzilla-adjacent series Monarch: Legacy of Monster, dropped its first two episodes this week, with new episodes arriving weekly thereafter. Also this week, Scott Pilgrim Takes Off hits Netflix, while Max gets in on the act this week by premiering the second season of Julia.
Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, Max, Apple TV+, Disney+, Paramount+, and Peacock still have new shows coming for the rest of November, including a handful arriving next week. But if you've been thinking about cutting back on your streaming bill, then perhaps you should consider signing up for the ad-supported tiers. In the meantime, keep reading for our weekly roundup of the best new shows to stream.
When you're done here, check out the best new movies to stream this week, as well as the best shows on Netflix, best shows on Hulu, best shows on Amazon Prime Video, and best shows on Disney+.
