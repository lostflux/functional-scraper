Now, those advanced features are available as Google Duet , and one stands out as a threat to Grammarly’s dominance in AI proofreading.
Google Proofread goes much further than the usual spelling and grammar check that’s part of Google Docs.
 It suggests alternate wording to match the context of the document, listing dynamic or formal alternatives.
Proofread also analyzes sentences for conciseness since a shorter message is often more effective. You might see a suggestion to split long sentences to make them easier to understand. It also reminds you to use an active voice, a writing term for speaking directly and removing complicated language.
Google witness accidentally reveals how much Apple gets for Safari search Google could kill Gmail spam with an upcoming major update GPT-4: how to use the AI chatbot that puts ChatGPT to shame Google Proofread looks very similar to Grammarly. The suggestions appear in a sidebar at the right. Each recommendation comes with a label to clarify the reasoning. You can see Spelling, Conciseness, Grammar, Active Voice, and Wording suggestions in Google’s example screenshot.
Google One significant difference between Grammarly and Google Proofread is pricing and availability. Grammarly has a free tier; anyone can install the browser extension or mobile app. Grammarly recently expanded its AI capabilities with the launch of Grammarly Go , a generative-writing feature.
Proofread is only available to paid Workspace subscribers since it’s part of Google Duet. For the $30 monthly fee, enterprise users get advanced AI features in many Workspace apps, including Google Docs, Sheets, Slides, Gmail, Meet, and more.
After a slow start, Google is moving quickly with its AI rollout. Google Duet with Proofread launched immediately after the announcement, and there is a 14-day trial available via Google’s Workspace website.
Editors' Recommendations Google’s new AI model means the outlook for weather forecasting is bright Google tackles scammers offering malware-laden ‘Bard’ tool Microsoft Copilot vs. Google Duet: battle of the next-gen AI smart assistants Google’s answer to Microsoft Copilot is finally here Malware is spreading through Google Bard ads — here’s how to avoid them Google Tech News Computing Generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools like ChatGPT have gotten a bad rep recently, but Google is apparently trying to serve up something more positive with its next project: an AI that can offer helpful life advice to people going through tough times.
If a fresh report from The New York Times is to be believed, Google has been testing its AI tech with at least 21 different assignments, including “life advice, ideas, planning instructions and tutoring tips.” The work spans both professional and personal scenarios that users might encounter.
Computing Google is looking to get ahead of high-severity vulnerabilities on its Chrome browser by shortening the time between security updates.
The brand hopes that more frequent updates will give bad actors less time to access and exploit n-day and zero-day flaws found within Chrome browser code.
Computing Researchers at Cornell University have discovered a new way for AI tools to steal your data -- keystrokes. A new research paper details an AI-driven attack that can steal passwords with up to 95% accuracy by listening to what you type on your keyboard.
The researchers accomplished this by training an AI model on the sound of keystrokes and deploying it on a nearby phone. The integrated microphone listened for keystrokes on a MacBook Pro and was able to reproduce them with 95% accuracy -- the highest accuracy the researchers have seen without the use of a large language model.
