Why trust us? Metroid Prime 4: Release date prediction, trailers, gameplay, and more By Joseph Yaden Close One of Nintendo‚Äôs lesser-known yet still beloved franchises is Metroid ‚Äî a series that originally began on the NES , putting us in the shoes of bounty hunter Samus Aran. Now, over 35 years later, fans are eagerly awaiting the next entry in the series, Metroid Prime 4, which has been in the works for several years.
Trailers Release date Platforms Multiplayer Preorder The Prime series takes the formula introduced in the 2D games and turns it into a 3D, first-person adventure that still very much feels like Metroid, despite the perspective shift.
Hyper for the next installment in the series has found new life now that the original Metroid Prime is available to play on the Nintendo Switch (and there are rumors that the published sequels on are the way as well).
While there isn‚Äôt much we know about Metroid Prime 4 , there are some small tidbits of information around the internet here and there. We‚Äôve scoured as much as we could find to bring you everything we know about Metroid Prime 4.
Trailers Announcement trailer Originally revealed during E3 2017, Metroid Prime 4 was shown in the most minuscule capacity possible. Since it was still very early in development at that time, Nintendo only had a logo ready, revealing that the game was in development and pretty much nothing else via its announcement trailer. The trailer had some fancy space-themed ‚Äúbeep boops,‚Äù but aside from that, only the title was shown.
While this was an excellent announcement, it was tough to get too overly excited for a game that we knew nothing about. Nonetheless, you can check out its initial E3 2017 announcement trailer above.
Release date Metroid Prime 4 has had a rocky history since its original announcement in 2017. At the time, there were rumors that Bandai Namco was working on the game, with Nintendo overseeing its development. It was never confirmed which developer was working on it initially, only that Retro Studios ‚Äî the team behind the other Prime games ‚Äî would not be involved for some reason (likely due to other projects).
After its announcement, the game went radio silent for a while. Fast forward to January 2019, and Nintendo announced that development on Metroid Prime 4 had been restarted due to a lack of quality in what had been created up to that point. ‚ÄúEver since the announcement [of Metroid Prime 4 ], we have not been able to give you an update, but as a result of the continuing development since that time, although this is very regrettable ‚Äî we must let you know that the current development progress has not reached the standards we seek in a sequel to the Metroid Prime series,‚Äù Shinya Takahashi of Nintendo said during an update video (which you can watch above).
‚ÄúNintendo always strives for the highest quality in our games; and in the development phase, we challenge ourselves and confront whether the game is living up to that quality on a daily basis,‚Äù Takahashi continued. ‚ÄúIf we‚Äôre not satisfied with the quality, we aren‚Äôt able to deliver it to our customers with confidence, and the game will not live up to our fans‚Äô expectations.‚Äù Nintendo finally announced that Retro Studios will be handling the development of Metroid Prime 4 , headed by longtime series producer Kensuke Tanabe. In the video, Takahashi said, ‚ÄúIt will be a long road until the next time we will be able to update you on the development progress,‚Äù and since then, we haven‚Äôt heard anything else about the game from Nintendo.
We are looking for a ùóïùóºùòÄùòÄ/ ùóîùóú ùóóùó≤ùòÄùó∂ùó¥ùóªùó≤ùóø to join us on our journey to develop Metroid Prime 4! #GameJobs #GameDev #GameDevJobs https://t.co/NWVPLGel3E pic.twitter.com/T6Hexjia6s &mdash; Retro Studios (@RetroStudios) December 14, 2020 As of December 2020, Retro Studios was still in the midst of hiring for the project. In fact, it was looking for a boss/AI designer, which proved development was still early at that time. Even in July 2022, Retro Studios is still looking to fill a number of vacancies, including an environment designer, gameplay engineer, and lead concept artist.
All of this is to say that Metroid Prime 4 won‚Äôt be ready any time soon. Even if Retro hit the ground running right away in January 2019, that only puts it three years deep into development, and considering the production hurdles and the fact that the team is still hiring for major roles, you shouldn‚Äôt expect to play until 2023 at the earliest. A more realistic estimate places its release sometime in 2024, given the high expectations from fans and Nintendo‚Äôs focus on quality. Ultimately, this is a good thing, but the wait will no doubt be excruciating.
In February 2022, Retro Studios updated its Twitter page with new art featuring Samus, serving as the first new piece of information about the game since the 2019 video announcing the project had been restarted.
Image used with permission by copyright holder Sure, it‚Äôs not much, but at this point, any news about Metroid Prime 4 is worth discussing. Retro Studios and Nintendo no doubt knew the community would notice this subtle update, so perhaps this is an indication of a developmental milestone, hopefully meaning it‚Äôll be ready to show soon.
One thing to consider is that a remaster of the first Metroid Prime game is reportedly in the works according to GamesBeat reporter Jeff Grubb (via GameSpot ). Grubb says he‚Äôs been told ‚Äúpretty definitively‚Äù that all three games in the trilogy will be remastered but that Nintendo will release them individually to draw out the build to Prime 4.
 If true, this could indicate that Prime 4 is further away than we had hoped.
Platforms Image used with permission by copyright holder As far as we know, Metroid Prime 4 is still in the works for Nintendo Switch, though it wouldn‚Äôt be surprising if it turned into a cross-platform release like The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess for the GameCube and Wii or Breath of the Wild for the Wii U and Nintendo Switch. Considering Prime 4 won‚Äôt be out for a while, it‚Äôs logical Nintendo might opt to publish it on whatever device comes out after the Switch.
All we can say is that Prime 4 will be exclusive to a Nintendo platform when it does come out. Sorry, PlayStation and Xbox players.
Multiplayer Image used with permission by copyright holder The Metroid Prime series is no stranger to multiplayer. Whether it‚Äôs Prime 2‚Äôs local couch play or even the online multiplayer of the critically-panned Federation Force for 3DS, it‚Äôs a series that lends itself to playing with others ‚Äî for better or worse. While there‚Äôs been no confirmation of whether Prime 4 will feature multiplayer, some fans have been vocal about wanting some sort of online cooperative play. Online functionality has never been Nintendo‚Äôs area of expertise, but perhaps if the game launches for the company‚Äôs next system, online integration will work much better.
It could feature both co-op and competitive modes to round out the package, reminiscent of previous entries in the series. At this point, though, the main focus seems to be on the core game itself, as that is arguably the most important aspect. It‚Äôs unclear if Prime 4 will allow you to play with others, but it‚Äôs a safe bet it will feature some sort of multiplayer mode, whether it be offline or online via the internet.
Preorder Image used with permission by copyright holder Despite the game‚Äôs major developmental troubles, Metroid Prime 4 is actually available to preorder through Amazon right now. However, we wouldn‚Äôt make much of this, as it‚Äôs been available to preorder for quite some time with no signs of release any time soon. Still, it can be mildly satisfying to put money down on it, even if it won‚Äôt make the wait go by any faster.
Editors' Recommendations Hollow Knight: Silksong: release date speculation, trailers, gameplay, and more GTA 6: release date speculation, trailer, news, rumors, and more RoboCop: Rogue City: release date speculation, trailers, gameplay, and more Haunted Chocolatier: release date speculation, news, trailer, and more Cities: Skylines 2: release date, trailers, gameplay, and more Amazon Nintendo Nintendo Switch Tech News Gaming The Dishonored series has always been a critical darling and it has cultivated a small, but passionate fanbase. The original game got some DLC, a sequel in Dishonored 2, and one last entry called Death of the Outsider in 2017, but since then the franchise has remained dormant. The studio's latest game, Deathloop, shares some DNA with Dishonored, but is certainly its own beast. However, since the success of that new IP far exceeded anything Dishonored had achieved, many fans felt we'd never return to Dunwall to see the conclusion of the story. Thanks to the recent leak of some court documents related to the Activision purchase by Xbox, which owns Dishonored publisher Bethesda, new hope has appeared for the existence of Dishonored 3.
Release window According to the leaked documents, which we should still take with skepticism until an official public statement is made, Dishonored 3 is currently planned for a "FY24E" release. FY24E is shorthand for Fiscal Year 2024, which runs between April 2024 and March 2025. Again, things are likely to change, if they haven't already, but this is at least a good starting point to predict the earliest we might see it.
Platforms Again, this is just speculation until the game is officially confirmed, but considering that Xbox owns publisher Bethesda, Dishonored 3 is almost certainly going to be an Xbox console exclusive with a PC port. It should also be available as a day one Game Pass title, as all Xbox first party titles are.
Trailers As mentioned, Dishonored 3 isn't even meant to be known about publicly yet, so no marketing exists for the game. All we have is the name.
Gameplay Gaming We all knew Final Fantasy 7 Remake was just the beginning, but had no idea how long we would have to wait for the next part, or even how many parts this incredibly ambitious project would end up spanning. Since fans have been begging Square Enix to remake what is quite possibly the most popular and most important JRPG of all time for years, there was obviously a lot of pressure on the studio to get it right. While there was plenty of skepticism regarding the first part changing so much about the core formula, once we had it in our hands, it became almost universally praised.
After Remake, there was next to no news on when Cloud and his ragtag team's adventure would continue. That is, not until the 25th anniversary of the original PlayStation 1 game, when Square Enix dropped a ton of info on us all at once. The biggest news was obviously the official reveal of Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, the second part in what we now know to be a trilogy of titles. Since then, we've collected all the info drops as they've occurred. Here's everything we know about Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth.
Gaming Spider-Man is one of the most recognizable superheroes in the world. His popularity in media is hard to overstate, as he is the focus of ongoing films, comics, multiple animated series, and, of course, video games. The web-slinger has been on home consoles ever since the Atari days, and each new generation has given us better and better games. The most recent game, Marvel's Spider-Man, which paired the comic book hero with the perfect developer (Insomniac Games) to handle this acrobatic, sarcastic neighborhood hero, was a smash-hit in every respect. Critics praised it, fans loved it, and it sold like crazy. Plus, it probably was a major contributing factor in Sony's outright purchase of the studio. Naturally, we all knew a sequel had to be coming.
When the PlayStation 5 launched, we got a standalone expansion of sorts in Spider-Man: Miles Morales, which let us play as the new spider on the block in his own story. Now the focus has been set on the proper, full sequel, which looks to take everything from the original game and the expansion and combine it all into a truly amazing new Spider-Man (Spider-Men?) title. We've only had a handful of looks at the game, but we've used our spider senses to untangle all the information there is about Marvel's Spider-Man 2.
