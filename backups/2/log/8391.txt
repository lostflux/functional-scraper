SpaceX posted footage showing the brief test fire from directly above (bottom video), with one of the Starship’s six Raptor engines powering up for about six seconds.

Despite ending in failure when the rocket exploded in midair minutes after launch, the Super Heavy became the most powerful rocket ever to fly, packing around 17 million pounds of thrust at launch, almost double that of NASA’s Space Launch System moon rocket that flew for the first time last November.
SpaceX given green light to send mighty Starship rocket skyward SpaceX says it could fly Starship on Friday, but it depends on one thing Watch SpaceX’s most recent Starlink mission in just 60 seconds The upper stage Starship vehicle is designed for reuse so its Raptor engines will be used for controlled deorbit burns, whether returning to Earth or setting down on another celestial body. NASA is aiming to use a modified version of the upper stage to land two astronauts on the moon, possibly as early as 2025, though clearly there’s plenty of testing that has to be completed before that date can be considered concrete.
Following April’s failed test flight, the FAA ordered SpaceX to take 63 corrective steps before the second test flight. SpaceX says it’s now ready to launch , but the FAA has yet to issue the necessary flight permit.

SpaceX has been preparing to fly the Starship again, but another test flight won't happen just yet as the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has grounded the rocket following a recent investigation.
As reported by The Guardian, the FAA recently completed its investigation into April's test flight and found the vehicle's explosion was due to multiple factors. The company has now been presented with a lift of 63 corrective steps it will have to perform before the Starship is allowed to fly again.
Space Following a series of recent engine tests, SpaceX chief Elon Musk has declared the mighty Starship rocket ready for launch ... but first, there’s the small matter of obtaining clearance from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).
SpaceX posted a short video (below) on Tuesday evening showing the first-stage Super Heavy rocket and upper-stage Starship spacecraft -- collectively known as the Starship -- on the launchpad at the company’s Starbase facility in Boca Chica, Texas.
