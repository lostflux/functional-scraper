The free streaming service will feature its award-winning live coverage, which is currently shown on the NASA Live site. NASA+ will also stream original video series about the agency’s numerous space missions — past, present, and future — together with other original content.
NASA just launched a free streaming channel called NASA+ NASA’s Psyche mission launches to explore a metal asteroid NASA calls off Thursday’s launch of Psyche asteroid mission The update comes at an exciting time for NASA as it prepares to send the first astronauts toward the moon since the final Apollo mission in 1972. Artemis II will send three Americans and one Canadian on a flyby of the lunar surface next year, followed by Artemis III, which will put the first woman and first person of color on the moon. Astronauts are currently testing a new camera to capture the crewed lunar landing, with much of the captured imagery no doubt destined for NASA+ as well as the agency’s refreshed website and app.
“Our vision is to inspire humanity through a unified, world-class NASA web experience,” Jeff Seaton, NASA’s chief information officer, said earlier this year when news of the update first hit. “NASA’s legacy footprint presents an opportunity to dramatically improve the user experience for the public we serve. Modernizing our main websites from a technology standpoint and streamlining how the public engages with our content online are critical first steps in making our agency’s information more accessible, discoverable, and secure.” Editors' Recommendations Paramount+ launches Tis the Season for Streaming holiday collection NASA shares trailers for original shows coming to its new streaming channel Meet the new NASA communications system that’s hitching a ride in today’s Psyche launch How to watch NASA’s Psyche mission launch to a metal asteroid this week Watch NASA’s capsule with asteroid samples hurtling to Earth Entertainment Tech News Space Record-breaking NASA astronaut Frank Rubio will return to Earth this Wednesday.
