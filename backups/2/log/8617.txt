In years past, most people probably didn’t think twice about the chips that powered their devices. But in recent years—as our phones, computers, connected devices and even routers have become capable of more incredible feats with every minute—people are paying closer attention to the tiny computers that make these things possible. Companies like MediaTek, a global fabless semiconductor company, are becoming much more well known.
MediaTek in particular powers a lot of devices we’ve come to rely on for our day-to-day activities, bringing advanced connectivity and AI capabilities to devices such as smart TVs and speakers, Wi-Fi routers, fitness equipment and smartphones. In fact, with its technology powering more than 2 billion new devices each year, chances are you already have a MediaTek device or two in your home. As connectivity has become more important than ever during this global pandemic, we can all thank MediaTek for helping to reinvent the technology that is keeping us connected.
Take Chromebooks, for example. In the last year alone, Chromebook sales have expanded an incredible 274.6 percent , in large part due to the fact that many of us now work remotely and take classes at home. MediaTek’s Kompanio chip, known for their premium performance, power efficiency, and reliable connectivity, power some of the slimmest, most portable, and highly rated Chromebooks on the market—including ones made by Acer, ASUS, and Lenovo.

Wi-Fi 6 was created last year to better handle the many connected devices taking up a household’s bandwidth at any given time. MediaTek’s Wi-Fi 6 solutions not only power the next generation of advanced routers—including ones by Belkin and D-Link—they also provide seamless Wi-Fi 6 connectivity to other devices including OPPO and Redmi 5G smartphones, and Samsung smart TVs. The company’s MT7921 Wi-Fi 6 SoC is even powering the new ASUS Republic of Gamers (ROG) and The Ultimate Force (TUF) gaming notebooks. And the best part is that these chips are designed to be super power-efficient to extend devices’ battery life. With MediaTek’s connectivity advancements, the company is delivering faster, smarter, and more reliable connected experiences, even as our expectations for connectivity and performance continue to grow.
MediaTek is also bringing consumers the latest AI capabilities. For smart TVs, MediaTek is enabling sophisticated AI features, including facial- and scene-recognition technology to create theater-quality pictures. In fact, MediaTek is the top chip provider for smart TVs, powering more than two billion TVs and holding more than 70 percent of the market share. MediaTek also brings advanced AI to many other Internet of Things (IoT) devices, from smaller devices like smart speakers, thermostats and light bulbs, to bigger devices such as smart bikes, ovens and vacuums. Not only do MediaTek chips power IoT devices made by the biggest brands such as Amazon, Alibaba, and Sony, but MediaTek also works with smaller companies to help them design unique AI-powered products and bring them to market faster.
Over the last year, our expectations for connectivity have grown, which has led to a greater interest in the chips that power our lives. With MediaTek’s chips that combine incredible performance, advanced AI capabilities, brilliant imaging, and much more, we can all enjoy smarter, more connected experiences whether we’re at home or on the go.
