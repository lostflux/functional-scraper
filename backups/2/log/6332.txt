Why trust us? iRobot Roomba Combo j9+ robot vacuum and mop is perfect for high-pile carpet By Jon Bitner Close Robot vacuum maker iRobot recently pulled back the curtain on the Combo j5+ lineup , and today its catalog is growing yet again with the reveal of the iRobot Roomba Combo j9+ Robot Vacuum and Mop. If you don’t need a mop, a standard j9+ robot vacuum is also up for grabs — featuring the same tech powering the Roomba Combo j9+, but dropping its mopping skills and gaining a reduced price tag.
Unlike most robot vacuum and mop combos, the iRobot Roomba Combo j9+ uses a swinging mophead capable of retracting to the top of its chassis. Other products simply raise the mophead up a few millimeters, which is only enough clearance for low-pile carpets. This makes the Combo j9+ compelling for homes with both hardwood floors and high-pile carpets, allowing it to clean all surfaces without dragging a dirty mop across your “clean” carpets.
iRobot Other standout features include pressurized mop scrubbing for improved cleaning, sensors to automatically adjust suction for extra dirty floors, and impressive navigation skills that allow it to avoid obstacles such as cords, shoes, clothes, and pet toys.
The Combo j9+ robot vacuum and mop can hold up to 60 days of debris and refills liquid for up to 30 days using its large base station. And thanks to the unique Dirt Detective software available with iRobot OS 7.0, the robot will slowly learn your cleaning preferences and develop a routine that figures out which parts of your home need extra attention — passing over these areas multiple times or ramping up suction as needed.
Cordless vs. robot vacuums: which one should you buy? How to fix a robot vacuum that stops moving Self-emptying robot vacuums: Do you really need one? It’s a similar story for the j9+ robot vacuum, minus the ability to mop. Consider giving it a look if you need something more affordable and don’t mind mopping your kitchen floors yourself.
The Roomba Combo j9+ Robot Vacuum and Mop is now available for preorder and costs $1,399. The Roomba j9+ is also up for preorder with a price tag of $899. Both are expected to be released later this year.

Editors' Recommendations The SwitchBot Mini Robot Vacuum K10+ is designed for cramped rooms and tight spaces How often should you replace your robot vacuum? Ecovacs Deebot X2 Omni vs. iRobot Roomba Combo j9+: Which premium robot vacuum is best? iRobot Roomba Combo j9+ vs. Roomba Combo j7+: which is the best robot vacuum? Roborock is launching two affordable robot vacuums in October Appliances Robot Vacuums Tech News Smart Home IFA 2023, an annual consumer electronics show, has been filled with impressive smart home reveals, but when it comes to automated floor cleaners, few products on display were as innovative as the SwitchBot S10. Like existing robot vacuums and mops, the S10 is capable of vacuuming and mopping your floor without any manual input. The big difference, however, is the SwitchBot Floor Cleaning Robot S10 hooks up to your plumbing to perform automated water changes.
That makes the S10 the first auto-refilling and auto-draining robot mop available to the public -- which should make it an impressive rival for the Roborock S8 Pro Ultra and Ecovacs Deebot T20 Omni. SwitchBot notes that the S10 supports most existing plumbing systems, and after you’ve connected the dock to your water line and drainage pipe, all you’ll need to do is empty its dustbin every 70 days.
Smart Home The Roomba Combo j7+ is getting two new family members, as iRobot is expanding its lineup of robot vacuum and mops with the Combo j5+ and Combo i5+. Both devices are now up for preorder, with an expected launch date of September 3.
Unlike the expensive Combo j7+, the Combo j5+ and Combo i5+ are lower-priced options that offer many of the same features. The j5+ is a particular standout, allowing you to swap between vacuuming and mopping to just vacuuming by switching out its bin. Its charging dock can hold up to 60 days of debris before it needs to be manually emptied, and the robot itself boasts AI that can identify cords, shoes, and other hazards scattered throughout your home.
Smart Home The Dyson 360 Vis Nav is one of the most expensive robot vacuums available, and it comes with a few impressive features you won’t find on other models with lower price tags. However, the Ecovacs Deebot T20 Omni has established itself as one of the best robot vacuums, thanks to its ability to vacuum, mop, empty its dustbin, and clean itself after each session.
So which is best for your smart home? Here’s a look at the Dyson 360 Vis Nav 360 and Ecovacs Deebot T20 Omni to help you decide.
