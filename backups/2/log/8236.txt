Research in Motion launched BlackBerry 10, the company’s last best hope to make a turnaround in the cutthroat smartphone market. RIM may have helped build the first deadly smartphone fleet, but Apple lead a coup in 2007 and has been guiding the armada ever since. But it’s not so simple, in the wake of Apple’s ascension to command, rivals Android and Windows Phone have appeared in the mist and risen with the tide. Outcast by the mainstream, and diminished by its opponents, RIM has been losing share of the seas, but it doesn’t plan to go down without one last fight. Using every tactic at its disposal, RIM has completely reconstructed its BlackBerry operating system, hoping to win back its following and reclaim its phone throne. Today, RIM launches its first volley of new phones and apps in more than a year. Will it succeed or are its efforts in vain? Keep up with all our coverage here.
