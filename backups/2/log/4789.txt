The move will double the number of fast-chargers currently available to Ford’s EV owners.

Starting in 2025, Ford will equip future EVs with Tesla’s NACS charge port — removing the need for an adapter — for direct access to Tesla Superchargers, the automaker said.
Toyota joins ‘the Tesla plug’ club Tesla shows off first Cybertruck after two years of delays 2024 Chevrolet Equinox EV aims for affordability with $30,000 base price The agreement between Tesla and Ford is linked to President Joe Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, announced in February, which offers $7.5 billion in subsidies for EV charging as part of plans to dramatically boost the number of publicly available vehicle chargers along U.S. highways.
Tesla started opening up its Superchargers to other EVs in Europe in 2021 before gradually expanding the availability. Its fast chargers can add up to 200 miles of range in just 15 minutes.
“This is great news for our customers, who will have unprecedented access to the largest network of fast chargers in the U.S. and Canada with 12,000-plus Tesla Superchargers, plus 10,000-plus fast chargers already in [Ford’s] BlueOval Charge Network,” said Jim Farley , Ford president and CEO. “Widespread access to fast charging is absolutely vital to our growth as an EV brand, and this breakthrough agreement comes as we are ramping up production of our popular Mustang Mach-E and F-150 Lightning, and preparing to launch a series of next-generation EVs starting in 2025.” Marin Gjaja, chief customer officer of Ford Model e, praised the EV maker led by Elon Musk, saying: “Tesla has led the industry in creating a large, reliable, and efficient charging system and we are pleased to be able to join forces in a way that benefits customers and overall EV adoption.” Gjaja added: “The Tesla Supercharger network has excellent reliability, and the NACS plug is smaller and lighter. Overall, this provides a superior experience for customers.” Editors' Recommendations Lucid joins other automakers by adopting Tesla charging plug Tesla’s Elon Musk can build his unusual Supercharger station Tesla used car market no longer as lucrative, data shows 2022 Ford F-150 Lightning vs. 2024 Chevrolet Silverado EV Tesla starts opening up its Supercharger network to other EVs Tech News Tesla Cars Elon Musk caused consternation among many Tesla owners recently when he said the company is planning to open up its Supercharger stations to non-Tesla electric vehicles (EVs), with many fearing the move will result in crowded facilities and longer lines at chargers.
But in a second-quarter earnings call with Tesla investors on Monday, July 26, the Tesla chief made clear he was still committed to the plan, though acknowledged that for it to be effective the electric-car company will need to expand the Supercharger network at a rapid pace to keep up with growing EV output by other automakers.
Cars After years of talking about it, Tesla CEO Elon Musk this week confirmed that the electric-car company will start to open up its network of Superchargers to other vehicles “later this year.” Musk revealed the news on Tuesday, July 21, in response to a tweet about the company’s technology for rapid charging.
Cars Released in 2012, the Model S is the oldest member of the Tesla range. It's about to look a lot newer than its age suggests thanks to a much-needed update that brings a fully redesigned interior and a lot more power.
Not much has changed on the outside, and the sedan remains recognizable as a Model S. Look closely and you might notice stylists gave it a nip-and-tuck that brings a redesigned front bumper, small aerodynamic tweaks out back, and new wheels. Visually, it takes a well-trained eye to tell the latest evolution of the S apart from its predecessor.
