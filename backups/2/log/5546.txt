And it's not just Microsoft.
Updating to Windows 11 is well worth it.
 If you have a Windows 10 PC or laptop already, then you can upgrade to Windows 11 for free very easily, but you can also get it for free by buying a new PC, or even building a new computer yourself.
Check that your PC is compatible Upgrade to Windows 11 for free using Windows Update Update to Windows 11 for free using the Installation Assistant Update to Windows 11 for free using the Media Creation Tool Get Windows 11 for 'free' when you buy a new PC Whatever your situation, here's how to upgrade to Windows 11 for free.
Difficulty Duration What You Need A Windows 10 key, or Windows 10 PC or laptop Internet access A USB drive with at least 8GB of free space (optional) Check that your PC is compatible Before you try to upgrade your PC to Windows 11 for free, make sure that it is compatible. You'll need a PC that supports Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 2.0 and has the Secure Boot option in your BIOS. It must also meet some basic hardware requirements.
To find out whether your PC is capable of running Windows 11, search for PC Health Check in Windows search, and run the corresponding application, or check Microsoft's Windows 11 specs page and cross-reference it with your system. If you're not sure what hardware you have, follow these steps to check your PC specs.
Upgrade to Windows 11 for free using Windows Update If you have a Windows 10 PC or laptop that's ready for Windows 11, you can upgrade to Windows 11 for free just by running the update tool.

Step 1: Visit the Windows 11 download website and look for the Windows 11 Installation Assistant.
Select the blue Download now button.
Step 2: When it's finished downloading, run the Windows11InstallationAssistant.exe and give administrator approval, if requested.
Step 3: Select Accept and install to accept the terms and conditions, then begin the Windows 11 update process.
Step 4: The installation will then proceed without much input from you. It will download the Windows 11 installation media, then run the update. This could take up to 30 minutes, so you may need to wait, but when it's complete, you should have a free update to Windows 11 installed.
Image used with permission by copyright holder Update to Windows 11 for free using the Media Creation Tool If you are starting a new PC build, or want to install Windows 11 on a new drive for your existing Windows 10 PC, the Windows Update tool and Installation Assistant won't work so well. What you can use instead, is the Media Creation Tool.
Step 1: Head to Microsoft's Windows 11 upgrade page and under the heading Create Windows 11 Installation Media, select the blue Download Now button. This will download mediacreationtool.exe file to your PC.
Step 2: Launch the Media Creation Tool like you would any other program, and give administrator approval, if requested.
Step 3: Accept the Microsoft terms and conditions, then choose your language and the version of Windows 11 you want to install, if necessary. Otherwise, leave the default recommended options. Select Next when you're ready to proceed.
Step 4: Find a USB drive with at least 8GB of free space and plug it into your PC or laptop. Then select the USB Flash Drive option in the Media Creation Tool setup process. Select Next.
Alternatively, if you want to virtually mount the Windows 11 installation media, you can select ISO file and follow the on-screen instructions to create it for later mounting.
Step 5: Select the USB drive you want to use for the installation. Then, when ready to setup the drive, select Next.
Wait for the setup process to complete.
Step 6: Once the installation media is created, you can reboot your PC and boot to the USB drive to begin upgrading to Windows 11. Follow our guide on how to install Windows 11 for tips on the installation process and, if prompted, input your Windows 10 key to activate.
Get Windows 11 for 'free' when you buy a new PC If you're buying a new PC, you're almost certainly going to get it with Windows 11 included, so if you don't want to buy a Windows license and don't have an upgradeable PC, this might be the best way. Alternatively, you can look for Windows 10 PCs and use their valid key to update to Windows 11 for free using the above methods.
Unfortunately, you can't update from Windows 8 or Windows 7 straight to Windows 11, but if you have an older system with a valid key, you can always upgrade to Windows 10 first. Follow these steps on downloading Windows 10 for free , then see if you can update to Windows 11 for free afterwards.

Deals Keeping your devices safe, whether browsing online or not, should be paramount. It's not just because of an expanding sea of dangers but also the potential for more localized issues -- viruses, malware, and beyond. Nowadays, we have a lot invested in our digital worlds and a lot to protect when we sit down to work at our digital devices. Weâ€™re more susceptible to hacking, identity theft, and data collection than ever before, and with these intrusions can come a lot of headaches. Keeping tabs on the best antivirus software is always a good idea, and a Norton Antivirus free trial is a good way to explore one of the best options available. Not only does Norton provide some of the best identity theft protection, but itâ€™s also one of the best antivirus apps for the iPhone. So, that makes a Norton Antivirus free trial the perfect way to start exploring a more secure digital existence -- you can decide how much you like the service without spending much.
Is there a Norton Antivirus free trial? There is a Norton Antivirus free trial, and itâ€™s a pretty impressive offering. With a Norton Antivirus free trial, youâ€™ll get full access to one of four plans that Norton offers. There is a Plus Plan, a Standard Plan, a Deluxe Plan, and the fully loaded Select Plan. Each plan increases the antivirus features offered and the number of devices covered, and each plan increases in price. A Norton Antivirus free trial is good for 30 days, and youâ€™ll need to create an account and provide a credit card for Norton to keep on file.
Bear in mind that if you want to protect your online browsing habits, you'll want to pair Norton with a VPN. A VPN masks your public IP address and assigns you a new, remote one while the VPN is active. The CyberGhost free trial, ExpressVPN free trial, and the NordVPN free trial are some great options there. So, you can test them out before committing to a long-term subscription.
Computing Microsoft has just announced the latest update to Windows 11, which brings the operating system up to version 23H2. This is a cumulative update that comes with some of the most exciting features already announced in September, including Copilot, and brings some changes to Teams, among other things. Here's what's new and how to get it on your own PC.
When Microsoft first announced Copilot during its September event, many thought that it'd be available right away -- and it was, but not widely. Now, with the 23H2 update, Copilot should be downloaded and toggled on by default, alongside everything else that was announced during the Surface event. Some new things are on the way, too.
