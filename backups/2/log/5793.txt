That was a mistake By Gabe Gurwin Close Image used with permission by copyright holder No one has played every video game. Not even the experts. In Backlog , Digital Trends’ gaming team goes back to the important games they’ve never played to see what makes them so special… Or not.
Take a look at a screenshot from any Mario game released in the last 20 years and you’ll instantly see something to love.
Super Mario Galaxy ’s cosmic levels give you a rush of excitement without even picking up a controller. The transformed enemies and objects in Super Mario Odyssey give just a hint of the game’s possibilities. Even the 22-year-old Super Mario 64 looks inviting, with its bright colors and cheery polygonal plumber.
I love Mario in all his forms, but I’ve actively avoided one of his adventures my whole life.
Super Mario RPG is halfway between a remaster and remake It’s Super Mario Bros. Wonder’s subtle changes that make it special Wonder no more: the new voice of Mario has revealed himself I love Mario in all his forms, but I’ve actively avoided one of his adventures my whole life. It wasn’t that I refused to play Super Mario Bros. 3 , but every time I’ve had the opportunity to play it, there was always a more welcoming Mario game within an arm’s reach. It’s considered one of the most important platformers of all time, but as someone approaching it for the first time, decades after it set the world on fire, this wasn’t immediately apparent.
Super Mario Bros. 3 employs a visual style that is an uncomfortable mix of old and new. Series creator Shigeru Miyamoto claimed, years later, that the game existed as a stage play , which would account for these inconsistencies. But with the Mushroom Kingdom already being so surreal and bizarre, this explanation appeared to serve as an excuse created to fit the game’s new elements, rather than the other way around.
Goombas – abandoned in the American sequel – return in Mario’s third outing, but with a gross yellowish tint that is more off-putting than it is familiar. Toad’s legs are too long, as if he managed to eat a Super Mushroom, or his own head. I could never see myself experiencing the same whimsy I felt playing other Mario games.
Image used with permission by copyright holder Looks aren’t everything After playing for a few hours, though, I saw why my friends, peers, and the world at large had fallen in love with this game. Its mix of power-ups and difficult enemies makes for a firm-but-fair challenge, and the variety in level design is among Nintendo’s best. If there’s a particular level you don’t want to try, you can even use a special item to just skip it completely. When I reached a Koopaling boss at the end of the first castle, I expected a quick death, but using a little common sense and a few timely jumps had me beating the little dude in no time.
What impressed me the most, however, wasn’t anything specific included in Super Mario Bros 3.
, but rather the influence it had on some of my favorite games. I found myself overcome with a sort of “reverse nostalgia” during my time with Super Mario Bros. 3.
 Every few minutes, I would recognize something from a game that I had played before, but was released long after this had been.
I found myself overcome with a sort of ‘reverse nostalgia’ No longer did we have to rely on trial and error or guessing games in order to progress, which we saw as the Castlevania and Zelda series moved to the Super Nintendo. Its tricks — hiding enemies and special areas high and low — have become staples of first-person shooters like Doom and even Dark Souls , giving players reasons to replay levels beyond getting a higher score.
Even more than 25 years later, it’s astounding just how creative Super Mario Bros. 3 feels. Secrets were a staple of the original Super Mario Bros.
, with the famous “warp zone” allowing players to quickly skip several worlds in order to make it to Bowser more quickly.
Super Mario Bros. 3 rewarded keen-eyed players even more – certain levels can only be traversed after acquiring a raccoon suit and flying up above holes in the ceiling. Others are actually easier to complete in Mario’s original “little” form, which is a design philosophy we often see amateurs use when creating levels in Super Mario Maker.
 Even the most mundane element of the environment – the basic brick block – is often an enemy in disguise, ready to pounce when you least expect it.
Though this design philosophy did exist in the previous two Mario games, it became a critical tool in Super Mario Bros. 3.
 The default way to play through a level didn’t have to just be sprinting from left to right. The rewards for your curiosity are often limited to extra collectibles not necessary for reaching the game’s final credits, but by questioning every component of a stage, searching for hidden items, and even turning enemies into power-ups to reach inaccessible areas, it becomes much cleverer than it initially appeared. That kind of rule-bending informs the cleverness at the heart of all the other Mario’s adventures that came after it, including Super Mario Odyssey.
When it comes down to it, I’d still rather play a more modern Mario. One that benefits from everything designers learned from Super Mario Bros. 3 , but doesn’t have a vomit-tinted hue like its predecessor.
Super Mario Odyssey begs to be loved before you take one step in its world, promising hours of fun. I found that same fun in Super Mario Bros. 3 , but I had to dig through an unpleasant exterior first. Mario always makes me laugh. The Goombas don’t make me cry.
Editors' Recommendations Nintendo introduces a new Super Smash Bros. Switch OLED for Black Friday Our 10 favorite Wonder Effects in Super Mario Bros. Wonder Super Mario Bros. Wonder has some of Nintendo’s best online features Play these 3DS and Wii U games before Nintendo shutters their online features Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door is getting a surprise Switch release Backlog Features Nintendo Nintendo Switch Gaming It’s been an unexpected year of change for Mario. The Super Mario Bros. Movie reversed the series’ big-screen fortunes, delivering a blockbuster hit led by (non-Italian) Chris Pratt. More shockingly, Nintendo recently announced that longtime Mario voice actor Charles Martinet is stepping down from the role after decades of work. A new era is dawning on the Mushroom Kingdom, and you can feel a bit of anxiety among longtime fans who don’t want the character they love to change too much.
With all those complicated threads coming together, Super Mario Wonder feels like a fitting game for the moment. It’s a throwback to Mario’s traditional 2D platformers, keeping old fans happy while still promising some level of transformation -- and I’m not just talking about Mario’s new elephant form. Whether it was Nintendo’s intention for not, it could wind up being the most symbolic release in the franchise’s long history.
That context was in the back of my mind when I demoed an hour of Super Mario Wonder, jumping through six of its main courses and two bonus stages. Longtime fans won’t be disappointed, as the latest entry retains all of its staples and Nintendo’s enduring 2D design chops. What’s more exciting, though, is how many new ideas Super Mario Wonder brings to an old formula. It’s not a total transformation, but it exists in a healthy middle ground that should make it a reliable crowd-pleaser.
The Flower Kingdom I’m not sure anyone needs me to go over the basics of a 2D Mario game at this point: run, jump, collect coins and power-ups. All of those gameplay hooks are unchanged, as is Nintendo’s level design philosophy. If you still love that formula, that’s probably all you need to know until reviews hit this October.
Gaming Nintendo is launching a Nintendo Switch - OLED Model Mario Red Edition in October. The news capped off the company's Super Mario Bros. Wonder Direct today, which shared new details on the upcoming platformer.
This new themed version of the latest Nintendo Switch iteration is completely red across the system and Joy-Cons. On the back of it, players can find a silhouette of Mario and hidden coins. It's not as detailed as The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom's OLED model, but it does look very sleek. This Mario Red Edition system will come out on October 6, two weeks ahead of Super Mario Bros. Wonder's release.
Gaming Nintendo will reveal more about Super Mario Bros. Wonder during a Nintendo Direct dedicated to the game that's set for later this week. Nintendo announced this new 2D Mario game during a Direct in June, but we haven't learned much more about it since then outside of the fact that Charles Martinet won't voice Mario in it. As such, this is a presentation Mario fans will definitely want to tune into ahead of the game's release in October. If you're planning to watch the Super Mario Bros. Wonder Direct live, this is everything you need to know about watching it.
When is the Super Mario Bros. Wonder Direct Nintendo confirmed that the Super Mario Bros. Wonder Direct will take place at 7 a.m. PT on August 31. It says the showcase will last "roughly 15 minutes," so you'll only need to set aside a little bit of time on Thursday morning for it.
How to watch the Super Mario Bros. Wonder Direct Like most Nintendo Directs, this Super Mario Bros. Wonder Direct will be live-streamed on Nintendo's YouTube channel. The premiere for it is already live on YouTube, and you can watch it from this article with the embedded video below.
Super Mario Bros. Wonder Direct 8.31.2023 What to expect from the Super Mario Bros. Wonder Direct Super Mario Bros. Wonder launches for Nintendo Switch on October 20, but there's still a lot we don't know about it. Nintendo simply says the Direct will serve as "an in-depth look at Mario's latest 2D side-scrolling adventure," so expect a deep dive into the different characters, gimmicks, and abilities players will encounter during the game.
I personally hope we learn more about some of the new power-ups we can use in the adventure, like the Wonder Flower that makes levels weird and the strange-looking power-up that turns Mario into an elephant. One thing you shouldn't expect from this Direct: other Nintendo games. This is a livestream to tune into if you want to learn more about Super Mario Bros. Wonder and Super Mario Bros. Wonder alone. That's not such a bad thing, though.
