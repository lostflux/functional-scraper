Why trust us? This bestselling Gskyer starter telescope is 34% off at Amazon By Aaron Mamiit Close Image used with permission by copyright holder Stargazers who are just starting out with the hobby can avoid getting overwhelmed by complicated setups and exorbitant costs if they look for affordable telescope deals like this one — the Gskyer Telescope AZ70400 for only $86, following a $44 discount from Amazon on its original price of $130. There’s no telling how long this offer for this starter telescope will be online though, so you’ll have to complete the transaction with a sense of urgency if you want to enjoy the savings.
Why you should buy the Gskyer Telescope AZ70400 Rookie stargazers will love having the Gskyer Telescope AZ70400 in their backyard. The assembly process is relatively simple and takes just 15 to 30 minutes, with a step-by-step guide that’s friendly for beginners. Once it’s all set up, the telescope’s focal length of 400mm and aperture of 70mm results in precise and high-resolution images when you’re looking at celestial objects such as stars and the Moon.
 The Gskyer Telescope AZ70400 comes with a 10mm eyepieces and a 25mm eyepiece, plus a 3X Barlow lens that triples magnifying power to up to 120x, for a wide range of options depending on the distance of the object that you want to observe. The high-transmission coatings on the glass lens, meanwhile, reduce reflections and increase the amount of light entering the eyepiece for brighter images.
You’ll be able to quickly locate objects on the Gskyer Telescope AZ70400’s 5×24 finder scope with a mounting bracket and cross-hair lines, while the telescope’s wireless remote and smartphone adapter will allow you to easily explore the night sky and capture stunning photos, especially when you also use the best astronomy apps.
 The telescope also comes with an adjustable aluminum alloy tripod that will let you place it in the perfect viewing position, and a carry bag for transportation.
The Gskyer Telescope AZ70400, with all of its features and accessories, already provides amazing value for your money with its original price of $130, so it’s a steal for its discounted price of just $86 from Amazon. However, if you want to take advantage of the $44 worth of savings, you’ll need to hurry with your purchase. That’s because we’re not sure what will happen first — the end of the price cut for the Gskyer Telescope AZ70400, or stocks selling out.
Editors' Recommendations This smart Celestron telescope is 32% off for Prime Day in October Deals Amazon Space NASA's Curiosity rover, which is currently exploring Mars' Gale Crater, recently marked an impressive milestone: 4,000 days on Mars. The rover landed more than a decade ago on August 5, 2012, and since then it has continued to explore the area, collect rock samples, and make its way up the epic slopes of Mount Sharp.
The 4,000 days are measured in mission time, which is calculated in martian days or sols. Due to the differing rates of rotation of Earth and Mars, a day on Mars is slightly longer than a day on Earth, by about 40 minutes. And also, due to the difference distances between Earth and Mars and the sun, a martian year is longer too - at 668 sols, equivalent to 687 Earth days. Those working on Mars rover missions, especially the rover drivers, have to operate on Mars time, so their schedules are out of sync with typical Earth working hours and they generally work on 90-sol shifts to allow them time to readjust to Earth schedules.
Space Astronomers recently discovered the most distant black hole ever observed in the X-ray wavelength, and it has some unusual properties that could help uncover the mysteries of how the largest black holes form.
Within the center of most galaxies lies a supermassive black hole, which is hundreds of thousands or even millions or billions of times the mass of our sun. These huge black holes are thought to be related to the way in which galaxies form, but this relationship isn't clear -- and how exactly supermassive black holes grow so massive is also an open question.
