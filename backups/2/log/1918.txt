Jan 2023 Deep Learning Indaba Awards 2023: Celebrating the Best in AI Research and Innovation It is with great pleasure that we announce the launch of the Indaba Awards 2023, a celebration of African research excellence and impactful work in Artificial Intelligence. The awards recognise the outstanding work of individuals, teams, and communities who are pushing the boundaries of what is possible and benefiting local communities across the continent through their work.
The awards are a celebration of three intellectual giants of our continent: The Kambule Doctoral Award recognises and encourages excellence in research and writing by doctoral candidates at African universities in any area of computational and statistical sciences.
The Alele-Williams Masters Award (formerly the Kambule Masters Award) recognises excellence by Master’s degree candidates at African universities in any area of computational and statistical sciences.
The Maathai Impact Award encourages and recognises work by African innovators that show an impactful application (including but not limited to technical, societal, environmental, and economic) of machine learning and artificial intelligence. This award is open to individuals, teams, or organisations in both academic and non-academic settings. The Awards Committee considers impactful work to be broadly defined as any work related to Artificial Intelligence — technological, social, environmental or economic — that has had or has the potential to positively transform and empower specific African societies and communities.
To submit a nomination for the awards, please visit our website and fill out the online form for the respective awards. The deadline for submissions has been extended to 14 March 2023.
The awards ceremony will take place at the Deep Learning Indaba conference, which will be held in Ghana, in September 2023. We look forward to seeing the innovative and impactful work that will be submitted for the Deep Learning Indaba Awards 2023. The awards are an important way to recognise and celebrate the achievements of those working to advance the field of AI and make a positive impact on the world.
