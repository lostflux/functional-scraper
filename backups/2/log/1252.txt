Home Tech Best early Black Friday deals on products ZDNET's tested and recommend Written by June Wan, Reviews Editor Nov. 17, 2023 at 2:53 p.m. PT View now View at Best Buy View now View at OnePlus View now View at Amazon View now View at Amazon View now View at Amazon View now View at Amazon View now View at Amazon View now View at PC Richard & Son View now View at Amazon We're still in the early days of Black Friday, but all it really takes is a glimpse at ZDNET's live blog to know just how many deals are on the table this year. Whether you're shopping for a new TV, pair of headphones, laptop, tablet, or even robot vacuum, we've got you covered.
Also: The best early Black Friday deals But if you're feeling overwhelmed by the sheer volume of deals to be had, or uncertain of what's actually worth buying, let this roundup serve as the guiding light of your Black Friday shopping. Throughout the years, ZDNET's tested and reviewed hundreds, if not thousands, of consumer electronics, from smartphones to personal computers to smart home appliances, and many of our highest-rated products just so happen to be on sale during this time of the year.
The list below not only contains gadgets and gizmos that are heavily discounted but are ultimately worth investing in, as our writers and editors can attest to.
Early Black Friday 2023 deals on ZDNET's best-rated products Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra Save $300 June Wan/ZDNET Current price: $899 Original price: $1,199 I tested Samsung's flagship smartphone back in February, and to this day, it's still the most complete handset that money can buy. From the big and bright AMOLED display to the competent quad-camera setup to the integrated S Pen stylus, there's not much, if anything, that's missing from the Ultra model.

But nearly 12 months later, I'm here to report that the OnePlus Open is, in fact, the best in its class, with a form factor, software suite, and price that shadows its competition. Right now, a trade-in of any phone in any condition sees $200 discounted from the OnePlus Open, making it a fantastic deal for a foldable.

Even at its standard price of $499, you're getting a flagship-level camera system, the same software features found on Google's more expensive Pixels, and a fantastic 90Hz display. Now, for $125 less, one of the best-value phones on the market just got better.

Its flagship QuietComfort 45 model features immersive noise cancellation, a sleek and timeless design, and some of the best audio output that ZDNET's headphones expert, Jada Jones, has heard. Right now, the same pair can be had at a $130 discount, making it a great pick-up for audiophiles and casual listeners alike.

Fortunately, the newest AirPods feature more than just a different look, they also support Conversation Awareness and a more responsive Adaptive Audio experience, meaning they'll adjust your volume levels as you go from listening to music to talking to someone nearby.

That's a recipe for success, especially if you're someone who's always on their feet. We're seeing one of the best discounts on the latest MacBook model during Black Friday, bringing it down to just $1,049.

ZDNET's Maria Diaz decided to buy one over the regular iPad earlier this year and had no regrets. The Fire HD 8 Kids is built to withstand the rigors of children and supports customizable parental controls so you're always in the know of what your child can and can't do.

ZDNET's Artie Beaty reviewed the 65-inch model and praised it for offering plenty of entertainment features at a more accessible price than Samsung, Sony, and LG.
