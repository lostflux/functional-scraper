What you may not have realized was how some creative usage of its skills could unlock all sorts of incredible, new abilities beyond simple text responses.
Make a logo with ChatGPT Create 3D animation with ChatGPT Composing an entire song Learning to make music Write an entire book in one day ChatGPT is a tool Here are five amazing things that people have already achieved with ChatGPT that show just how powerful it is.
Make a logo with ChatGPT grinvalds / Getty Images As I began researching interesting and unusual ways to use ChatGPT, I checked on the possibility of employing ChatGPT to handle some text-to-image challenges.
OpenAI‚Äôs Dall-E has already been making waves with its photorealistic and stylistic interpretations based on prompts. What visual skills does ChatGPT have? GPT-4 Turbo is the biggest update since ChatGPT‚Äôs launch Apple may finally beef up Siri with AI smarts next year Bing Chat just beat a security check to stop hackers and spammers While ChatGPT responds in text, it is possible to ask it to write the code to generate particular types of computer graphics. On Twitter, DataChazGPT had success in asking ChatGPT to create scalable vector graphics (SVG) code to draw the Twitter logo.
A neat #ChatGPT tip for designers from @faridsabitov ! Ask it to generate an SVG icon + copy and paste it directly to @figma ü§Øü§Øü§Ø pic.twitter.com/ViwL0Bt45L &mdash; DataChazGPT ü§Ø (not a bot) (@DataChaz) December 22, 2022 It‚Äôs important to keep in mind that ChatGPT will usually respond even when it‚Äôs just making things up, so it‚Äôs wise to double-check results before making use of any AI-generated code. In my own tests, I got a result that bore some resemblance to the Twitter logo the first time, followed by two blue dots on the second request, and a blue rectangle containing the word ‚ÄúTwitter‚Äù in white text on the third try.
ChatGPT did warn, in each case, ‚ÄúKeep in mind that this is just an example, and the actual Twitter logo may look different and use different code.‚Äù But that‚Äôs just in the case of recreating a logo that already exists. A better way to use ChatGPT might be to create a completely new logo for your product or business, which some have already begun to do.
Create 3D animation with ChatGPT Adam Doud/Digital Trends A much more impressive use of ChatGPT‚Äôs image coding skills results in 3D animation, albeit with a little help from a programmer.
YouTube channel MarbleScience asked ChatGPT to write the code for a marble bouncing on the floor, using the popular Javascript library ‚Äúthree.js,‚Äù which is a free, open-source, 3D framework for developers.
The code that ChatGPT provided was flawed, in that the ball moved upward so that it never bounced, but with a simple addition of a minus sign, a ball drops and makes a single bounce. After a follow-up question, requesting more than one bounce, ChatGPT guided MarbleScience to make adjustments to simulate the effect of gravity, providing multiple bounces.
For simple requests, ChatGPT code often works correctly with no modifications. For more complex programming, collaborative design seems to provide the best results at the moment, with a human expert correcting minor flaws and interacting with the AI to generate the bulk of the code. Just as with Tesla‚Äôs Full Self-Driving, replacing humans entirely is currently out of reach and someone needs to correct the computer when it makes an error.
Composing an entire song Image used with permission by copyright holder ChatGPT will sometimes remind you that it‚Äôs a large language model (LLM) that can‚Äôt connect to the internet and has no knowledge of current affairs. That means it can‚Äôt assist with writing articles that explore the latest advances in technology, for example. Music, however, has been around for as long as humans have walked the Earth and might be more accessible to this AI.
Musician Ramzoid shared his experience on YouTube of using ChatGPT to make music, rolling through several iterations as the AI created chord progressions, drum tracks, melodies, and lyrics. With a significant amount of help from the expert, Ramzoid managed to shape it into a nice pop tune.
Learning to make music A similar exploration by Ed Talenti, a music production expert, tested out the limits of AI music with ChatGPT. The chord progressions were interesting but it doesn‚Äôt seem to understand drum beats very well.
Rhythm is a natural part of life for physical beings like you and me, but an AI doesn‚Äôt have a heartbeat or a need to breathe. Of course, ChatGPT only knows what it has learned from humans, so there‚Äôs no reason it couldn‚Äôt lay down a catchy beat. Even so, the results were disappointing for these two musicians.
Talenti found that ChatGPT might be a great tool for learning music. It explains the reason for every suggestion and details how to create chords.
ChatGPT can also answer specific questions about music productions, such as how to compress a snare drum, providing room to expand your knowledge when you are ready.
What was amazing about the process was how quickly ChatGPT was able to supply creative elements of a song in a chosen style. If something doesn‚Äôt work, it‚Äôs easy to ask for adjustments and keep moving forward, a way to break through a creative block and inspire new ideas.
Write an entire book in one day Image used with permission by copyright holder Naturally, I had to give ChatGPT a try in helping with this article. I asked it to list some unique and creative ways to use an LLM. Among the suggestions, text generation for fiction caught my eye, and I checked if anyone had tried this yet. Various short stories abound, but no author has confessed to writing an entire novel with AI.
In fact, Reddit users Equal-Evidence2077 and AdmirableDrive9217 have lamented the toned-down approach of ChatGPT. The AI has been programmed to avoid violence and sexual situations, making fiction somewhat bland. Despite those limitations, the storytelling is impressive. ChatGPT can explain characters and details when prompted with questions later in the chat, demonstrating an understanding of the narrative. It doesn‚Äôt mind a rewrite request and makes adjustments quickly and without complaint.
Still searching for an example of an AI writing a whole book, I ran across a post by Reddit user jackb1980 , who asked ChatGPT to write a 16-chapter textbook on financial literacy. While it can‚Äôt do that in a single response, the AI did give a table of contents. Each chapter was then broken down by ChatGPT into a series of topics and each topic expanded into paragraphs. With a series of interactive prompts, jackb1980 was able to assemble the text of a 300-page, 16-chapter book.
ChatGPT is a tool Image used with permission by copyright holder ChatGPT really is a tool and by that, I mean an amazing personal assistant that can accelerate human potential or fill in a blank canvas and inspire creativity. ChatGPT can be frustrating at times, but paired with human sensibility, the AI provides nearly instant access to a vast amount of knowledge.
As another example of AI assistance, I created three of the images in this article with the assistance of OpenAI‚Äôs Dall-E. I tweaked the colors a bit to make them more pleasing and expanded the size with Pixelmator Pro‚Äôs super-resolution tool, but these are mostly AI-generated art, an area that has so far progressed faster than natural language processing.
Rather than feeling displaced by the rapid pace of AI, we should keep in mind that ChatGPT and large language models are simply a distillation of human knowledge, great research assistants, and idea generators. Everything these computer programs know comes from human-made training data. AI models are only amazing because you‚Äôre amazing.
Editors' Recommendations The world responds to the creator of ChatGPT being fired by his own company New ‚Äòpoisoning‚Äô tool spells trouble for AI text-to-image tech OpenAI‚Äôs new tool can spot fake AI images, but there‚Äôs a catch Bing Chat‚Äôs ads are sending users to dangerous malware sites This powerful ChatGPT feature is back from the dead ‚Äî with a few key changes Artificial Intelligence Features Computing OpenAI is rolling out new functionalities for ChatGPT that will allow prompts to be executed with images and voice directives in addition to text.
The AI brand announced on Monday that it will be making these new features available over the next two weeks to ChatGPT Plus and Enterprise users. The voice feature is available in iOS and Android in an opt-in capacity, while the images feature is available on all ChatGPT platforms. OpenAI notes it plans to expand the availability of the images and voice features beyond paid users after the staggered rollout.
Computing Most American adults do not trust artificial intelligence (AI) tools like ChatGPT and worry about their potential misuse, a new survey has found. It suggests that the frequent scandals surrounding AI-created malware and disinformation are taking their toll and that the public might be increasingly receptive to ideas of AI regulation.
The survey from the MITRE Corporation and the Harris Poll claims that just 39% of 2,063 U.S. adults polled believe that today‚Äôs AI tech is ‚Äúsafe and secure,‚Äù a drop of 9% from when the two firms conducted their last survey in November 2022.
Computing Facebook owner Meta is working on an artificial intelligence (AI) system that it hopes will be more powerful than GPT-4, the large language model developed by OpenAI that powers ChatGPT Plus. If successful, that could add much more competition to the world of generative AI chatbots -- and potentially bring a host of serious problems along with it.
According to The Wall Street Journal, Meta is aiming to launch its new AI model in 2024. The company reportedly wants the new model to be ‚Äúseveral times more powerful‚Äù than Llama 2, the AI tool it launched as recently as July 2023.
