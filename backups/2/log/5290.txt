In a statement on its website, the computer giant described the move as a “multiyear, multibillion-dollar” investment, declining to offer more specific financial details. Recent reports, however, have suggested that Microsoft’s investment, which follows two others in 2019 and 2021, could be worth in the region of $10 billion.
Microsoft said the support will boost OpenAI’s work on supercomputing and research and will enable the two companies to “independently commercialize the resulting advanced AI technologies.” GPT-4 Turbo is the biggest update since ChatGPT’s launch OpenAI’s new tool can spot fake AI images, but there’s a catch This powerful ChatGPT feature is back from the dead — with a few key changes More specifically, Microsoft wants to help accelerate OpenAI’s groundbreaking independent AI research, and build out the AI infrastructure of its cloud-based Azure platform “to help customers build and deploy their AI applications on a global scale.” There are also plans to deploy OpenAI’s models across Microsoft’s consumer and enterprise products and incorporate new digital experiences built on OpenAI’s technology.
“We formed our partnership with OpenAI around a shared ambition to responsibly advance cutting-edge AI research and democratize AI as a new technology platform,” said Microsoft chief Satya Nadella. “In this next phase of our partnership, developers and organizations across industries will have access to the best AI infrastructure, models, and toolchain with Azure to build and run their applications.” OpenAI boss Sam Altman said the three-year partnership with Microsoft has so far been “great,” adding that his startup is “excited to continue our independent research and work toward creating advanced AI that benefits everyone.” OpenAI’s ChatGPT software has taken the tech world by storm as the tool is a cut above traditional chatbots of the past. Trained using huge amounts of web data and refined through human feedback, the AI tool is able to respond in text form to human prompts in a way that’s both natural and creative.
David Hickton, founding director of the University of Pittsburgh’s Institute for Cyber Law, Policy and Security, said recently that the tool “has the potential to transform society in ways perhaps even more dramatically than Amazon and the iPhone,” but added that “many are glossing over the risks that come with such a powerful advancement.” Still, there are those that don’t particularly rate ChatGPT, including Yann LeCun, Meta’s chief AI scientist, who recently described the tool as “not particularly innovative.” Editors' Recommendations The world responds to the creator of ChatGPT being fired by his own company New ‘poisoning’ tool spells trouble for AI text-to-image tech ChatGPT: the latest news, controversies, and tips you need to know ChatGPT’s new upgrade finally breaks the text barrier Microsoft’s Copilot AI will have an ‘energy,’ apparently Artificial Intelligence Microsoft Tech News Computing Most American adults do not trust artificial intelligence (AI) tools like ChatGPT and worry about their potential misuse, a new survey has found. It suggests that the frequent scandals surrounding AI-created malware and disinformation are taking their toll and that the public might be increasingly receptive to ideas of AI regulation.
The survey from the MITRE Corporation and the Harris Poll claims that just 39% of 2,063 U.S. adults polled believe that today’s AI tech is “safe and secure,” a drop of 9% from when the two firms conducted their last survey in November 2022.
Computing It’s just been revealed that Microsoft researchers accidentally leaked 38TB of confidential information onto the company’s GitHub page, where potentially anyone could see it. Among the data trove was a backup of two former employees’ workstations, which contained keys, passwords, secrets, and more than 30,000 private Teams messages.
According to cloud security firm Wiz, the leak was published on Microsoft’s artificial intelligence (AI) GitHub repository and was accidentally included in a tranche of open-source training data. That means visitors were encouraged to download it, meaning it could have fallen into the wrong hands again and again.
Computing People were in awe when ChatGPT came out, impressed by its natural language abilities as an AI chatbot. But when the highly anticipated GPT-4 large language model came out, it blew the lid off what we thought was possible with AI, with some calling it the early glimpses of AGI (artificial general intelligence).
The creator of the model, OpenAI, calls it the company's "most advanced system, producing safer and more useful responses." Here's everything you need to know about it, including how to use it and what it can do.
What is GPT-4? GPT-4 is a new language model created by OpenAI that can generate text that is similar to human speech. It advances the technology used by ChatGPT, which is currently based on GPT-3.5. GPT is the acronym for Generative Pre-trained Transformer, a deep learning technology that uses artificial neural networks to write like a human.
