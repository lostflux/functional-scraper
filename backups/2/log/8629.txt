This article is sponsored by MPOW.
Headphones are an essential piece of tech today. Whether listening to music or podcasts on your phone, watching video on your laptop or playing games, comfortable, quality headphones make everything sound and feel better. But with so much choice in the market now, knowing which are the best available can be a problem.

A battery that can last a whole day is essential, and if it can manage two or three days? Even better, especially if you’re traveling and won’t know where you’ll be able to recharge.
Connectivity Bluetooth 5.0 is a must, offering crystal clear sound with a stronger, more stable connection and improved range. (It’s great for dancing around your home untethered!) Bluetooth also brings flexibility, and the ability to connect your headphones to almost any device you choose.
Sound The most important thing for many is clear, natural sound that does not distort. This means you can set everything just the way you want in your headphones and enjoy quality sound wherever you go. Look for good-sized drivers that deliver the bass-punch and distortion-free volume that makes for an engaging listening experience.
Comfort Finally, comfort. You could be wearing your headphones for hours at a time, especially if you’re running or at the gym. So, look for a pair that stay snug on your head and light weight. Headphones offering plenty of padding give you that secure fit without causing distraction.
Image used with permission by copyright holder With all this in mind, the Mpow 059 Pro , with Bluetooth 5.0, a 60-hour battery life and impressive custom tuned 40mm dynamic drivers with CSR chips, deliver exceptional audio quality whatever you are listening to. This makes them the best option for the budget conscious headphone buyer.
