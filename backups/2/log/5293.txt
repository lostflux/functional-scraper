The AI brand announced on Monday that it will be making these new features available over the next two weeks to ChatGPT Plus and Enterprise users. The voice feature is available in iOS and Android in an opt-in capacity, while the images feature is available on all ChatGPT platforms. OpenAI notes it plans to expand the availability of the images and voice features beyond paid users after the staggered rollout.
Twitter/X The voice chat functions as an auditory conversation between the user and ChatGPT. You press the button and say your question. After processing the information, the chatbot gives you an answer in auditory speech instead of in text. The process is similar to using virtual assistants such as Alexa or Google Assistant and could be the preamble to a complete revamp of virtual assistants as a whole. OpenAI’s announcement comes just days after Amazon revealed a similar feature coming to Alexa.
To implement voice and audio communication with ChatGPT, OpenAI uses a new text-to-speech model that is able to generate “human-like audio from just text and a few seconds of sample speech.” Additionally, its Whisper model can “transcribe your spoken words into text.” GPT-4 Turbo is the biggest update since ChatGPT’s launch Apple may finally beef up Siri with AI smarts next year Bing Chat just beat a security check to stop hackers and spammers OpenAI says it’s aware of the issues that could arise due to the power behind this feature, including, “the potential for malicious actors to impersonate public figures or commit fraud.” This is one of the main reasons the company plans to limit the use of its new features to “specific use cases and partnerships.” Even when the features are more widely available they will be accessible mainly to more privileged users, such as developers.
ChatGPT can now see, hear, and speak. Rolling out over next two weeks, Plus users will be able to have voice conversations with ChatGPT (iOS &amp; Android) and to include images in conversations (all platforms).

You can use the drawing tool with the app to help clarify your answer and have a back-and-forth conversation with the chatbot until your issue is resolved. This is similar to Microsoft’s new Copilot feature in Windows, which is built on OpenAI’s model.
OpenAI has also acknowledged the challenges of ChatGPT, such as its ongoing hallucination issue. When aligned with the image feature, the brand decided to limit certain functionalities, such as the chatbot’s “ability to analyze and make direct statements about people.” ChatGPT was first introduced as a text-to-speech tool late last year; however, OpenAI has quickly expanded its prowess. The original chatbot based on the GPT-3 language model has since been updated to GPT-3.5 and now GPT-4 , which is the model that is receiving the new feature.
When GPT-4 first launched in March, OpenAI announced various enterprise collaborations, such as Duolingo, which used the AI model to improve the accuracy of the listening and speech-based lessons on the language learning app. OpenAI has collaborated with Spotify to translate podcasts into other languages while preserving the sound of the podcaster’s voice. The company also spoke of its work with the mobile app, Be My Eyes, which works to aid blind and low-vision people. Many of these apps and services were available ahead of the images and voice update.
Editors' Recommendations The world responds to the creator of ChatGPT being fired by his own company New ‘poisoning’ tool spells trouble for AI text-to-image tech OpenAI’s new tool can spot fake AI images, but there’s a catch ChatGPT: the latest news, controversies, and tips you need to know This powerful ChatGPT feature is back from the dead — with a few key changes Artificial Intelligence Tech News Computing Most American adults do not trust artificial intelligence (AI) tools like ChatGPT and worry about their potential misuse, a new survey has found. It suggests that the frequent scandals surrounding AI-created malware and disinformation are taking their toll and that the public might be increasingly receptive to ideas of AI regulation.
The survey from the MITRE Corporation and the Harris Poll claims that just 39% of 2,063 U.S. adults polled believe that today’s AI tech is “safe and secure,” a drop of 9% from when the two firms conducted their last survey in November 2022.
Computing Facebook owner Meta is working on an artificial intelligence (AI) system that it hopes will be more powerful than GPT-4, the large language model developed by OpenAI that powers ChatGPT Plus. If successful, that could add much more competition to the world of generative AI chatbots -- and potentially bring a host of serious problems along with it.
According to The Wall Street Journal, Meta is aiming to launch its new AI model in 2024. The company reportedly wants the new model to be “several times more powerful” than Llama 2, the AI tool it launched as recently as July 2023.
Computing People were in awe when ChatGPT came out, impressed by its natural language abilities as an AI chatbot. But when the highly anticipated GPT-4 large language model came out, it blew the lid off what we thought was possible with AI, with some calling it the early glimpses of AGI (artificial general intelligence).
The creator of the model, OpenAI, calls it the company's "most advanced system, producing safer and more useful responses." Here's everything you need to know about it, including how to use it and what it can do.
What is GPT-4? GPT-4 is a new language model created by OpenAI that can generate text that is similar to human speech. It advances the technology used by ChatGPT, which is currently based on GPT-3.5. GPT is the acronym for Generative Pre-trained Transformer, a deep learning technology that uses artificial neural networks to write like a human.
