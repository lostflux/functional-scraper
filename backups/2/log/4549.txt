He’s held a special interest in computers and consumer technology ever since his mother brought home a Nintendo Entertainment System when he was four years old (a decision she regrets to this day), and he has written everything from news articles and deal roundups for laptops, Apple gadgets, smartphones, smartwatches, and pretty much anything else that uses electricity. When he’s not rounding up tech deals for Digital Trends or covering upcoming UFC fights for The Manual , Lucas can usually be found in his Hobbit hole reading, gaming, smoking a pipe, and messing about with computers.
