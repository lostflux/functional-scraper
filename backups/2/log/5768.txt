Redeeming your voucher code How PlayStation Plus vouchers are converted How PlayStation Now vouchers are converted We already know about the new three-tier system — Essential, Extra, and Premium — and what features those will entitle players to (though we’re still waiting on the specific game lineup). We also know that existing members will be transferred to the new model. If you only have PlayStation Plus, you will automatically be placed into the base PlayStation Plus Essential tier, and if you have just PlayStation Now or both PlayStation Plus and PlayStation Now, you will be placed in the Premium tier.
But what about players who have purchased but not claimed PlayStation Plus and PlayStation Now vouchers? Since Sony has temporarily stopped the redemption of these codes, those left holding unused ones are left wondering what will become of these subscription vouchers. Sony recently released membership conversion details, but they are a bit convoluted. We’re going to help break down what old vouchers will earn you under the new PlayStation Plus system.
The best games on PlayStation Plus, Extra, and Premium All suits in Spider-Man 2 and how to get them All photo-op locations in Spider-Man 2 See more Everything you need to know about the new PlayStation Plus The best PS Now games The best PS5 games for 2022 Redeeming your voucher code Image used with permission by copyright holder Sony is not allowing any Playstation Plus and Now vouchers to be redeemed at this time, presumably in an effort to prevent people from stacking up the cheaper subscriptions now so that they will be converted into the Premium tier later for much less than it would normally cost. Sony is sticking to this rule until the new PS Plus launches.
The company lays out this policy in a recently updated FAQ page about the new service: “If you currently have a PlayStation Plus or PlayStation Now membership, due to changes we are making to the service prior to launch, you won’t be able to redeem a voucher code for that service until your existing membership expires and deactivates, or after the new PlayStation Plus service launches in your area, whichever happens first. Rest assured that your voucher code is still valid.” Your codes are still good, but you have to hang on to them until after this new PlayStation Plus service launches in June for most regions. That being said, if your subscription lapses before then, you will be able to use your voucher in that instance.
How PlayStation Plus vouchers are converted If you have cards to add time to the normal, existing PlayStation Plus, that code will be good for different amounts of time depending on if you’re an existing subscriber, or if you want to put it toward higher tiers of the new PlayStation Plus. Here’s how it looks: 1-month PlayStation Plus vouchers turn into: New subscriber OR Essential tier subscription — Will convert into 31 days of PlayStation Plus Essential PlayStation Plus Extra subscription — Will convert into 20 days of PlayStation Plus Extra PlayStation Plus Premium subscription — Will convert into 17 days of PlayStation Plus Premium 3-month PlayStation Plus vouchers turn into: New subscriber OR Essential tier subscription — Will convert into 92 days of PlayStation Plus Essential PlayStation Plus Extra subscription — Will convert into 58 days of PlayStation Plus Extra Premium — Will convert into 46 days of PlayStation Plus Premium 12-month PlayStation Plus voucher turns into: New subscriber OR Essential tier subscription — Will convert into 365 days of PlayStation Plus Essential PlayStation Plus Extra subscription — Will convert into 219 days of PlayStation Plus Extra PlayStation Plus Premium subscription — Will convert into 183 days of PlayStation Plus Premium How PlayStation Now vouchers are converted If you’re one of the few out there who had gotten some PlayStation Now cards before they stopped being sold long before this new service was announced, you will still get value out of them. If you already have a PlayStation Plus subscription or sign up for any of these tiers before redeeming these vouchers, the number of days shown below will be added based on what tier you have or get. This chart is a little different because if all you have is PS Now, you will be treated as a new subscriber to PS Plus and automatically placed in the Premium tier.
1-month PlayStation Now vouchers turn into: New subscriber — Will convert into 21 days of PlayStation Plus Premium Essential tier subscription — Will convert into 40 days of PlayStation Plus Essential PlayStation Plus Extra subscription — Will convert into 25 days of PlayStation Plus Extra PlayStation Plus Premium subscription — Will convert into 21 days of PlayStation Plus Premium 3-month PlayStation Now vouchers turn into: New subscriber — Will convert into 53 days of PlayStation Plus Premium Essential tier subscription — Will convert into 105 days of PlayStation Plus Essential PlayStation Plus Extra subscription — Will convert into 66 days of PlayStation Plus Extra PlayStation Plus Premium subscription — Will convert into 53 days of PlayStation Plus Premium 12-month PlayStation Now vouchers turn into: New subscriber — Will convert into 183 days of PlayStation Plus Premium Essential tier subscription — Will convert into 365 days of PlayStation Plus Essential PlayStation Plus Extra subscription — Will convert into 219 days of PlayStation Plus Extra PlayStation Plus Premium subscription — Will convert into 183 days of PlayStation Plus Premium Editors' Recommendations PS Plus is getting an underrated RPG cult classic this month All upcoming PS5 games: 2023, 2024, and beyond All Mysterium locations in Spider-Man 2 All Prowler Stash locations in Spider-Man 2 PS Plus members can cloud stream PS5 games in 4K later this month Sony Sony PlayStation Gaming If you don't own the PlayStation 5 yet, or if you're planning to give it as a gift to a loved one, then you've come to the right place because we've rounded up the best PS5 deals. You can enjoy discounts not just on Sony's latest-generation video game console, but also on bundles that pair it with games and accessories. There's still a lot of demand for the PS5 though, so don't be surprised if these offers get sold out quickly. If you don't want to miss out, you'll have to decide on what to purchase from these bargains as soon as you can.
Refurbished PlayStation 5 Digital Edition -- $380, was $399 This is probably the cheapest price that you can pay for the PlayStation 5 -- getting a refurbished digital version of the console, which skips the disc drive and relies on online downloads. It's not brand new, but it's guaranteed to be in fine working condition so you'll be able to play the best PS5 games after installing them from the PlayStation Store or through a PlayStation Plus subscription.
Gaming Sony Interactive Entertainment President and CEO Jim Ryan is retiring after 30 years. The PlayStation boss will formally leave his role in March 2024 with a successor yet to be named.
Jim Ryan has been working with PlayStation since 1994 when he joined Sony Interactive Entertainment Europe. Since then, he's become the key figurehead for the PlayStation brand, similar to Phil Spencer's role within Xbox. His most recent success has come from the launch of the PlayStation 5, which has already surpassed a 40 million unit milestone. Today, Sony announced that Ryan plans to retire from the role.
Gaming Lies of P is a challenging role-playing game that will test your mettle at every turn with deadly enemies and dastardly environmental traps. But to make things even a bit more difficult, you'll have to contend with a collection of status effects that can majorly affect your character and make things much harder for you in battle. We've compiled a list of all status effects in Lies of P, as well as a list of ways to cure them.
All status effects There are a total of seven status effects, with each either dealing damage or having a noticeable impact on your ability to perform in battle. Here are all of them and how they work.
Overheat Overheat is caused by taking too much fire damage too quickly. When the Overheat bar fills entirely, you'll begin to burn and lose health until it is cured or wears off naturally. During this time, your Guard Regain recovery amount will also be reduced, which can drastically impact your survivability in fast-paced encounters.
Shock When Shock is applied, your character's stamina recovery will be reduced significantly, which can have devastating consequences. Until this effect is cured or wears of naturally, you'll be stuck with very limited movement and attack opportunities due to your decreased stamina.
Electric Shock Not to be confused with standard Shock, Electric Shock is caused by taking too much Electric Blitz damage in a short period of time. When this happens, you'll take increased Electric Blitz and physical damage for the duration of the effect, and your Fable meter will drain continuously, which can reduce your attack options in combat.
Decay Decay is caused by taking too much Acid damage within a small time window. This will cause constant weapon and acid damage, both of which can make life difficult for you in battle since letting it go on for too long can result in needing to repair your weapon while also dodging your foes' attacks.
Corruption Corruption is caused by a buildup of, well, Corruption. When this happens, you'll be afflicted with what is essentially your textbook poison effect, meaning your HP will drain continuously until it wears off or is healed with an item. This can be especially challenging to cope with when also fighting enemies, so avoiding sources of Corruption is highly advised when possible.
Break Break is an annoying status effect to contend with, as letting its bar build up entirely will temporarily decrease how much health your Pulse Cells heal. This can be especially frustrating when you already find yourself at low health and don't have many Pulse Cells left, but it's usually best to wait until the effect wears off before healing so you can ensure you get the maximum amount of health possible.
Disruption Disruption is perhaps the most concerning of all status effects in the game, as you'll be instantly killed when the Disruption bar fills up entirely. If you find yourself in a situation where a lot of Disruption damage is being doled out, it's best to back off until the bar depletes some or you'll soon be seeing a Game Over screen.
How to cure status effects There are multiple items in the game designed to help you cure specific ailments, as well as items that can increase your resistance to them so that you can reduce your chance of becoming infected to begin with. You can find these cure and resistance items in various places while exploring throughout the game, or you can buy them with Ergo from Polendia at Hotel Krat.
