Why trust us? 3 underrated 1980s sci-fi TV shows you should watch in November By Joe Allen Close By the 1980s, science fiction had become a much less niche proposition. Several major movies had proven that it was possible to make popular versions of these stories, and TV followed suit shortly after that.
Red Dwarf (1988) V (1983) Quantum Leap (1989) While there were several immensely popular sci-fi series airing during this period, a few also fell under the radar. These three shows are perfect examples of why sci-fi storytelling became much more popular in the 1980s across a wide array of different formats, whether it was in the U.S. or the U.K.
Red Dwarf (1988) A great example of a British sci-fi comedy, Red Dwarf ran for a staggering 12 seasons, and followed the adventures of the last man on Earth and his various companions. The show is immensely popular in the U.K., and new seasons still debut there every once in a while.
3 dramas on Prime Video you need to watch in November 6 best TV shows you need to watch in December Don’t let these 3 hidden gem November streaming TV shows fly under your radar With clever writing and an enduring premise, Red Dwarf is both bleak and endlessly charming. It has the kind of cynicism that has often been a definitive feature of British science fiction. It may not be quite as adventure-oriented as its American counterparts, but that’s part of what has allowed Red Dwarf to endure.
Red Dwarf is streaming for free on Tubi.
V (1983) If you’re looking for something short and sweet, V may fit the bill perfectly. The show was only a two-part miniseries when it originally aired in 1983, Following an invasion of Earth by humanoid aliens, the series tracks the slow realization that the aliens who claim to come in peace are in fact much more interested in becoming a conquering army.
The series ends on an admirably bleak note, with the alien conquerors dominating Earth, and a band of resistance fighters looking to space for an answer. It’s a nice, compact watch, and one that was a major deal when it was first released.
V is available for rent or purchase on Prime Video.
Quantum Leap (1989) The kind of sci-fi series that has become more popular in retrospect than it was when it actually aired, Quantum Leap follows a scientist who finds himself traveling through time, hopping into a different body in a different period for every episode.
The show was light, science fiction joy, and it was exactly the kind of show that most people loved watching just to see what would happen next. The stakes are almost always incredibly low, but the charm of Quantum Leap is the unique adventure that comes with each and every episode.
Quantum Leap is streaming on Peacock.
Editors' Recommendations 3 movies and TV shows like the hit Max series Julia you should watch right now 3 TV shows on Tubi you should watch in November 3 sci-fi movies on Paramount+ you need to watch in November 7 best sci-fi movie actors 3 PBS shows you should watch in November Entertainment Generally, we tend to give streamers the benefit of the doubt when it comes to their film libraries. But there's no getting around the fact that the science fiction selection on Peacock is awful. For every Back to the Future, there are dozens of low-budget schlock-fests like Atlantic Rim, Lord of the Elves, and Dino King. Those are all real movies on Peacock, but they aren't worth your time. And unfortunately, there's nothing new on Peacock in November in the popular genre.
With such a thin selection to work with, it can be truly challenging to find sci-fi flicks on Peacock that are worth watching. But after an exhaustive search, we've come up with the following three sci-fi movies on Peacock that you need to watch in November.
Freejack (1992) Entertainment Sci-fi films never go out of style. From Alien and Back to the Future to Dune and Blade Runner, sci-fi films continue to improve thanks to new technology. Many sci-fi films find a home on Netflix and wind up on the streamer's 10 most popular movies list. Films like Don't Look Up, The Adam Project, and Bird Box are 10 of the most popular English films on Netflix ever.
The Adam Project is one of our picks for sci-fi movies to watch in November. Other selections include the epic sequel to Godzilla: King of the Monsters, and a sci-fi thriller about a pilot's fight for survival against the dinosaurs.
Godzilla vs. Kong (2021) Entertainment Last month on Hulu was all about horror. But in November, the new titles on Hulu include three of the best sci-fi movies of the last decade or so. For fans of the genre, this is a special treat that shouldn't be missed.
This month, our picks include Tom Cruise in a film unlike any of his previous blockbusters, as well as a cult classic robots-versus-aliens movie, and the final installment of a cult-classic film trilogy. These are the three sci-fi movies on Hulu that you need to watch in November.
