It will be added to their popular, and affordable, Symfonisk lineup of Sonos-powered Wi-Fi speakers.

The Symfonisk floor lamp is new territory for the two companies, who hope to improve the versatility of the line, allowing people to “furnish with light and sound,” and put the floor lamp wherever it’s needed, solving the “challenge of not having enough room for a table to put the lamp on,” said Stjepan Begic, range design leader at Ikea of Sweden, in a press release.
Six years in hell: My aging Sonos speakers have survived outside Sonos’ new search feature needs work Bluetooth on Sonos’ new Era speakers isn’t what you think – it’s better Quite similar in design to the gen-2 table lamp, which our reviewer praised for its room-filling ambient sound quality, the floor lamp instead sits atop three slender legs and comes with a weaved bamboo shade that, according to the pictures in the press kit, appears to give off a soft, warm light. Additional shades can also be purchased if that one doesn’t match your decor. The speaker base itself appears to share the same play and volume up/down controls as the table lamp, as well as a similar fabric cover.

It can also be used in a multiroom setup, or added as rear surrounds in a Sonos system with a soundbar such as a Sonos Arc, Beam, or Ray for room-filling sound for movies and TV.
Sonos users will be familiar with the simple setup process with the Sonos S2 app, through which the speakers can also be controlled, connected with various music streaming services , and configured. Although the Symfonisk lineup does not support Alexa or Google voice assistants like many of Sonos ’ latest speakers, they are AirPlay 2 compatible and can be sonically optimized for your room with Sonos Truplay — if you have an iOS device, that is. Symfonisk devices can also be added and controlled through Ikea’s own Dirigera smart home hub and accompanying Ikea Home app.
“The Symfonisk floor lamp speaker is a great example of how our collaboration continues to challenge the traditional idea of sound in the home,” said Sara Lincoln, principal product manager at Sonos. “We created the floor lamp speaker to sound great on its own, but also to be versatile. It works seamlessly with all our Sonos speakers and is a great option for those who are looking to add rear speakers to their home theater setup.” The Ikea-Sonos Symfonisk floor lamp speaker will be available at Ikea for $260 on January 30, 2023.
Editors' Recommendations Sonos Move 2: Sonos’ biggest portable speaker gets a big update Sonos problems? A new Wi-Fi router might be the answer This tiny Ikea waterproof Bluetooth speaker is just $15 Sonos’ new Era 100 and Era 300 wireless speakers go all-in on spatial audio and Bluetooth Definitive Technology’s new speakers bring the boom from another Dymension Smart Home Sonos Tech News Smart Home The Sonos One and Google Nest Audio are two of the best smart speakers of 2023. Both can pump out impressive sound, respond to a wide variety of voice commands, and easily sync up with the rest of your smart home. But with the Sonos One costing more than $200 and the Google Nest Audio clocking in at just $100, you might be wondering if the Sonos One is truly worth your money -- or if you’d be better off saving $100 and opting for the cheaper Google product.
Before picking up either smart speaker, here’s a closer look at the Sonos One and Google Nest Audio.
Pricing and availability Smart Home When it comes to smart speakers, the Sonos One and HomePod mini are two of the best. Offering impeccable sound, great smart home connectivity, and sleek designs, few products can match the style and performance of these two behemoths. But which one is right for your home? While it’s impossible to go wrong with either, there are a few key differences between the two smart speakers that might make one a better fit for your home. Here’s a closer look at the Sonos One and HomePod mini to help you decide which is best.
Pricing and availability Audio / Video If a document published by accessory maker Sanus is accurate, Sonos' next speakers will be called the Era 100 and Era 300, according to a report from Chris Welch at The Verge. Welch claims that The Verge had already learned from its sources that "Era" will be the public-facing name of the as-yet-unreleased smart speaker that he had previously reported on under the code name "Optimo," and that the Sanus document offers further evidence of this claim.
Sanus is a company that makes a variety of mounting solutions for AV products, including many Sonos models such as the Sonos Beam, Arc, and Sonos One. The discovered document, which was posted to the site device.report, is entitled "Sanus Elite - Adjustable Speaker Wall Mount for Sonos Era 100 and Era 300 Speakers."
