But tech moves fast, and with that user base finally starting to dip , a new viral app has broken its record.
And yes, we’re talking about Threads, the new Twitter competitor from Meta.
 The new social media app has amassed a whopping 100 million users in just five days since its July 6 inception , according to the data tracking platform Quiver Quantitative.
Threads/Meta The platform saw 10 million registrations within the first seven hours, 30 million users on its first day, and over 70 million sign-ups the following day, with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg stating that user response to Threads has been, “way beyond our expectations.” Many have noted that this registration record has quickly succeeded one set by OpenAI’s ChatGPT in January , two months after it opened to the public as a test beta in November 2022. Prior to both milestones, it took tech brands years to achieve 100 million active users. It took Facebook four and a half years to reach 100 million active users.
This powerful ChatGPT feature is back from the dead — with a few key changes ChatGPT’s new upgrade finally breaks the text barrier GPT-4: how to use the AI chatbot that puts ChatGPT to shame For ChatGPT , the novel interest in text-to-speech artificial intelligence brought droves of people to sign up for the chatbot that could respond to text prompts as if it were a person on the other end.
With Threads, its parent company Meta benefits from the connection to its sister platform Instagram, which allows you can easily use the login details you already have to create an account. Amid months of issues at the Elon Musk-run Twitter, many have turned to Threads for refuge. The peak has been the social media platform’s chairman limiting the number of tweets registered users can view per day, while unregistered users can no longer access the site at all.
Twitter has also closed free access to its API, which restricts users from downloading massive amounts of posts for sharing elsewhere, under the guise of protecting its intellectual property. This instead broke many of the third-party tools that make the platform run smoothly. Some other major gripes Musk brought on included him making the verified blue check a paid-only option, and the excessive ad placement, which also marred the user experience.
Overall, the early adopted Threads appear to be well-received by users, with only a few complaints that point out the differences between it and Twitter.
 However, future updates are expected as Threads grows, and features like hashtags have already rolled out.
Editors' Recommendations Bing Chat just beat a security check to stop hackers and spammers Meta just created a Snoop Dogg AI for your text RPGs Meta is reportedly working on a GPT-4 rival, and it could have dire consequences Zoom adds ChatGPT to help you catch up on missed calls ChatGPT may soon moderate illegal content on sites like Facebook Artificial Intelligence Facebook Tech News Computing It's common knowledge -- Macs are less prone to malware than their Windows counterparts. That still holds true today, but the rise of ChatGPT and other AI tools is challenging the status quo, with even the FBI warning of its far-reaching implications for cybersecurity.
That may be why software developer Macpaw launched its own cybersecurity division -- dubbed Moonlock -- specifically to fight Mac malware. We spoke to Oleg Stukalenko, Lead Product Manager at Moonlock, to find out whether Mac malware is on the rise, and if ChatGPT could give hackers a massive advantage over everyday users.
State-sponsored attacks Computing Apple CEO Tim Cook has just revealed that the company has been working on generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools “for years.” The surprise announcement suggests that Apple could launch a ChatGPT rival -- supposedly dubbed “Apple GPT” -- sooner than anyone expected.
The announcement was made in an interview with Reuters following Apple’s third-quarter earnings report. Cook explained that higher research and development (R&D) spending at the company had been driven in part by an increased focus on generative AI.
Computing There has been much chatter recently about Apple working on its own ChatGPT rival called Apple GPT. Well, we’ve just had some bad news: the artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot is apparently years away from release.
Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo put a dampener on expectations in a recent blog post, where he outlined his expectations for what could positively or negatively affect Apple stock prices in the coming months. Apple GPT is so far away from readiness, Kuo believes, that it simply won’t impact Apple stock prices any time soon.
