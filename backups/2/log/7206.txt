Why trust us? The Samsung Galaxy S22+ is down to $439 at Walmart By Aaron Mamiit Close Andy Boxall/Digital Trends / Digital Trends With the release of the Samsung Galaxy S23 series of smartphones earlier this year, shoppers have been waiting for the Samsung Galaxy S22 series to appear in phone deals with huge discounts. If you’ve had an eye on the Samsung Galaxy S22+, don’t miss this chance to get an unlocked 128GB version for just $439 following a $369 discount from Walmart on its sticker price of $808. We’re not sure how much time remains on this bargain, but you should hurry with your purchase because we think stocks will sell out quickly.
Why you should buy the Samsung Galaxy S22+ The Samsung Galaxy S22+ , the predecessor of the Samsung Galaxy S23+ , offers smooth performance even when you’re multitasking between apps with its Qualcomm SM8450 Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 processor and 8GB of RAM. The smartphone is equipped with an impressive camera system composed of a 50MP wide, 12MP ultrawide, and 10MP telephoto at the back, and a 10MP selfie camera at the front. The Samsung Galaxy S22+ also comes with an IP68 rating for water resistance, and Android 13 with Samsung’s OneUI 5 out of the box.
Between the smartphones in the same series — the Samsung Galaxy S22, Samsung Galaxy S22+, and Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra — the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra is the outlier as it follows the footsteps of the now-defunct Galaxy Note line. The Samsung Galaxy S22+ is simply a larger version of the Samsung Galaxy S22 with a 6.6-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X screen, and it comes with a bigger 4,500 mAh battery. It’s the one that you want to buy if the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra is beyond your budget.
The Samsung Galaxy S22+ isn’t among the brand’s latest flagship smartphones, but it remains a highly capable device with impressive performance and features. If you want it, you can get it for nearly half its original price of $808 from Walmart, with the unlocked 128GB version going for only $439. We don’t think the savings of $369 will stay available for a long time though, so if you’re already looking forward to the Samsung Galaxy S22+ as your next phone, you’re going to want to complete the transaction as soon as possible.

Whichever deal sounds best to you, keep reading while we take you through what you need to know about the phone.
Why you should buy the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 Topping our roundup of the best folding phones, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 is an absolute delight. It's finally demonstrated how the folding phone has come of age. It has a 6.2-inch cover screen for one-handed scrolling and anything basic, and it unfolds to open up to a 7.6-inch interior screen. Both look gorgeous with a new Flex Hinge mechanism ensuring the phone can close without a gap.
Mobile Apple iPhones are great devices, especially if you like the more controlled environment of the Apple ecosystem, where things are a bit more streamlined. Of course, that also means you're likely to spend a hefty sum on one of the latest iPhones, like the iPhone 15, which can often be more money than some folks are willing to pay. Luckily, Apple somewhat addresses that issue with the iPhone SE lineup of phones, which are more budget-oriented devices that are surprisingly affordable.
When the original iPhone SE came out, it was quite a surprise for many, especially since Apple is known for its costly devices, and while it wasn't the best iPhone out there, it was still great. On the bright side, the newest iteration of the iPhone SE, the 2022 version, is also quite powerful, even though it's missing some of the higher-end features of the latest iPhones, like crash detection. What's even better is that you can pick it up from Walmart at a discounted price of $149, rather than the usual $379 it goes for, which is a substantial discount and probably one of the best iPhone deals we've seen in a while.
Mobile Tablets may not be the hot new thing in 2023, but they're still excellent machines for streaming movies, playing games, or getting work done on the go. And while it seems like the best iPads dominate most of the tablet market, there are still plenty of excellent Android tablet options you should consider.
Whether you want an ultra-premium and superpowerful option, or something more affordable and compact, the Android tablet market has something for everyone. No matter your budget or spec preferences, here are the best Android tablets you can buy in 2023.
