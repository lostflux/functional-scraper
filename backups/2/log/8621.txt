WhatsApp Messenger is one of the most popular and affordable media and document-sharing applications in the current social media app era. Millions of Android and iPhone users use this application to share images, videos, and other important data to stay connected with their loved ones or even to run their businesses.
While WhatsApp regularly backs up this shared data it doesn’t support migrating data from Android to iPhone due to security reasons, making it a nightmare for users who are switching platforms.
This is where the WonderShare MobileTrans app comes to the rescue. It provides users a simple and efficient method to transfer WhatsApp data from Android to iPhone instantly. It also lets users back up their WhatsApp data on a PC and restore it to their smartphone with few clicks.
How to Transfer WhatsApp Data from Android to iOS Using a PC To transfer WhatsApp data from Android to iPhone you can watch the following video or follow the steps below: Step # 1: First, download the WonderShare MobileTrans application from the official website to your PC, available for Windows or macOS.
Step # 2: Image used with permission by copyright holder Simply connect both your iOS and Android devices to your computer using USB/lighting cables. Ensure both smartphones are on “File Storage” mode.
Start MobileTrans and choose “WhatsApp Transfer” > “Transfer WhatsApp Messages.” The application will load the messages and other data from WhatsApp and prepare for transfer.
Note: It’s highly recommended that you cloud-backup your data (from WhatsApp settings) before migration.
Step # 3: Image used with permission by copyright holder When the preparation is complete, MobileTrans will automatically recognize your devices and prompt you to start the WhatsApp data migration by clicking on the “Start” button.
Make sure you have carefully selected your source and destination phones.
Step # 4: Once you have clicked the “Start” button, you will see the screen (as shown above), which indicates the start of the migration process.
After the process is complete, you can disconnect your smartphones and launch WhatsApp on your iPhone to confirm all the data has transferred.
