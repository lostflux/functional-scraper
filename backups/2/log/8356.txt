Crews will explore the lunar surface in next-generation rovers , but mission planners have serious concerns about all of the damaging dust that those buggies will kick up as they go.
To solve the problem, engineers are developing a way to melt the dust to create paved surfaces, offering a safer and smoother journey for rovers and their occupants.

However, engineers believe that on the moon astronauts will be able to replace the laser with sunlight concentrated through a Fresnel lens.
The European Space Agency (ESA) shared details of the work in a video posted online on Sunday. It follows a more detailed report about the technology published earlier this month.
&quot;Where we&#39;re going we DO need roads!&quot; üåö To keep abrasive, sticky, lunar dust at bay on the Moon, astronauts will need paved roads and landing pads.
But how can we build roads on the Moon? üîó https://t.co/OXsm2UckI9 pic.twitter.com/ieCgzJ3Y8a &mdash; ESA (@esa) October 22, 2023 Engineers working on the project have found a way to deploy a 1.77-inch-diameter (4.5 cm) laser beam to create triangular, hollow-centered geometric shapes about 7.87 inches (20 cm) across. The tiles can be interlocked to create solid surfaces across large areas of lunar soil, which could function as roads or landing pads, ESA said.
The project team estimates that it would take around 115 days to construct a suitable landing pad using the method.
ESA materials engineer Advenit Makaya described the resulting material as ‚Äúglasslike and brittle,‚Äù adding that as it would be subject to downward compression forces, repairs would be unnecessary if it suffered any cracks.
Lunar dust is abrasive and sharp, and the moon‚Äôs low gravity makes it a serious menace for visiting missions.
‚ÄúDust mitigation has been an issue for NASA since Apollo,‚Äù the U.S. space agency says on its website. ‚ÄúWhen astronauts were entering and exiting the lunar module, dust got everywhere ‚Äî it clogged mechanisms, interfered with instruments, caused radiators to overheat, and even tore up their spacesuits.‚Äù Anything that can keep the dust at bay will be a welcome improvement for the upcoming Artemis missions, so engineers will continue to develop the paving technology in the hope of sending it to the moon to literally turn dust into roads.

Russia was hoping to become the first nation to perform a successful soft landing near the moon's South Pole with its uncrewed Luna-25 spacecraft, but the mission failed in the final moments in August 2023, causing the vehicle to slam into the ground at high speed.
Space The four astronauts embarking on a mission to the moon next year have had their first good look at the Orion capsule that will take them there.
NASA astronauts Christina Koch, Victor Glover, and Reid Wiseman, along with Canadian Space Agency astronaut Jeremy Hansen, got up close and personal with the Orion spacecraft during a visit to the Kennedy Space Center from where the moon-bound Artemis II mission is currently scheduled to launch in November 2024.
Space NASA has shared an image of three spacecraft that will play a central role in its next three Artemis missions to the moon.
Having already successfully tested the Orion spacecraft on a lunar flyby at the end of last year after being blasted into space by NASA‚Äôs new Space Launch System rocket, the American space agency is now overseeing the building of three more Orion capsules for upcoming Artemis missions.
