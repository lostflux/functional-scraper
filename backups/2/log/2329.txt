Why trust us? Samsung confirms its 2023 QD-OLED TVs start at just $1,900, are available now By Simon Cohen Close Ever since Samsung formally announced the $4,500 price tag of its highly anticipated 77-inch S95C 4K QD-OLED TV , we’ve been patiently waiting to hear how much the company’s other 2023 OLED models will cost. Now we know that S90C will be its most affordable 2023 QD-OLED model at $1,900 for the 55-inch screen size. You can order them starting March 20 at most major Samsung retailers, except the 65-inch S90C, which is confirmed, but has yet to be released.

Samsung Samsung has also finally confirmed something we reported on during CES 2023 : its flagship S95C QD-OLED is also available in 65- and 55-inch models.
Wondering about the differences between the S95C and S90C? It comes down to brightness, sound, and design. The S95C is about 30% brighter than the S90C.
 The S90C retains the same brightness levels as Samsung’s excellent 2022 S95B.
Samsung adds HW-Q900C to its lineup of 2023 Dolby Atmos soundbars Sony releases its 2023 TV prices with one very big exception Samsung S95C OLED hands-on review: it’s time to get excited The S90C gets Dolby Atmos with Samsung’s Object Tracking Sound Lite system, which helps to adjust the sound parameters based on the content, while the S95C has Atmos with Object Tracking Sound+ — an AI-enhanced version of the sound system.
The S95C also benefits from Samsung’s new ultraslim One Connect Box, which puts all of the TV’s connections (power, HDMI ports, and antenna connection) in their own slender enclosure, which can then be piggybacked on the included stand for an all-in-one effect, or separated from the TV using the thin umbilical cord. This lets the S95C be wall-mounted almost flush with the wall.
Both models have Samsung’s AI-powered Neural Quantum processor, which handles the TVs’ billions of colors, as well as 4K upscaling and motion processing. For console gamers, the screens can deliver up to 120Hz variable refresh rates, and PC gamers benefit from Game Motion Plus, which takes that speed up to 144Hz.
Here’s the full lineup of 2023 Samsung OLED TVs: 2023 Samsung S95C 4K QD-OLED TV Samsung 77-inch, $4,500 65-inch, $3,300 55-inch, $2,500 2023 Samsung S90C 4K QD-OLED TV Samsung 77-inch, $3,600 65-inch, $2,600 55-inch, $1,900 Editors' Recommendations Sony’s 2023 A95L QD-OLED TV up for preorder in August starting at $2,800 After years of bashing OLED, Samsung now set to buy panels from LG I saw Sony’s 2023 TVs, and I think this model might be the best TV of the year Samsung’s 2023 Neo QLED TVs start at $1,200 — and you can buy them this week Samsung prices its 77-inch QD-OLED at $4,500. Presale starts now Samsung Tech News TV Audio / Video Usually, when new TVs are announced at CES, it can take months for companies to reveal pricing and availability. And perhaps Samsung was planning to do just that with its 77-inch S95C, its largest QD-OLED TV to date. But the company seemingly let the cat out of the bag on January 26, by including the new model -- and its price -- on its U.S. website, according to Sammobile.
The S95C details are no longer on the website, so Digital Trends can't verify the information, however, a screenshot taken at the time shows a price of $4499.99, making the larger model $1,500 more expensive than its currently available 65-inch S95B, which sells for $3,000. If this seems like a bigger gap in price than we're used to for models that exist in both 65- and 77-inch sizes, it could be because the S95C is going to be Samsung's premium 77-inch QD-OLED, with the planned S90C arriving in a 77-inch size but with fewer features.
Audio / Video Sharp has been on the fringes of the U.S. TV market for several years, but that might be about to change. The company, which is still headquartered in Japan ,but has been majority-owned by Chinese manufacturing giant Foxconn since 2016, has announced that it plans to sell a Roku-powered 4K OLED TV in the U.S. in spring 2023. It could be the first opportunity for people to buy a Roku TV with an OLED panel. The company will also introduce its latest mini-LED-powered QLED TV, the Aquos XLED.
Sharp's Japan-only DS1 OLED TV Sharp Audio / Video Just ahead of CES 2023, Digital Trends reported that TCL was intending to ship its first TV based on QD-OLED technology by the end of the year. This reporting was based on information given to Digital Trends as well as many other media outlets both during a private press briefing and in press materials issued ahead of the show. Now, however, TCL is pulling back on those comments.
"A line in the TCL CES 2023 press release confirming plans to launch the brand's first QD-OLED television this year was incorrectly included," a TCL spokesperson told Digital Trends in an emailed statement. "TCL is focused on its award-winning mini-LED technology in 2023 – including the recently announced TCL QM8 98-inch TV."
