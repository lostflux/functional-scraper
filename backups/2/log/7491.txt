With even newer streaming apps like ESPN+ and Sling, sports fans can now enjoy all of their favorite content online as well, from the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) to Top Rank Boxing and more.
TV shows and movies have been widely available via online streaming for years (even gaming consoles come loaded with Netflix, Hulu , and other apps now), letting virtually everybody with an internet connection save money by picking and choosing what services and channels they actually want to pay for. Sports content has been a bit trickier, however, due to stricter broadcasting restrictions which vary by region.
ESPN made things a lot easier when it rolled out the ESPN+ streaming service in early 2018, which was an especially welcome sight for people who enjoy the furious action of UFC and Top Rank Boxing. ESPN has developed an increasingly exclusive relationship with these MMA and boxing promotions, and today, ESPN+ is arguably one of the best ways to watch boxing , and it’s the only way to watch Top Rank Boxing events right on your computer, mobile device, or compatible smart TV without a cable or satellite subscription. Top Rank and ESPN have an exclusive partnership.

If you already have other streaming apps you like (and, if you’re a cord-cutter, you probably do), then you don’t have to pay out the nose to enjoy Top Rank Boxing matches and other fighting events: ESPN+ will set you back just $10 for a per-month subscription or $100 for an annual membership. You also have the option of signing up for this bundle which nets you ESPN+, Hulu , and Disney+ for just $13 per month (saving you 25%) if you’re looking for a more complete streaming package.
Other Streaming Platforms If you’re just now getting into the world of cord-cutting and you want to find an all-inclusive streaming service package that includes ESPN (rather than just signing up for ESPN+ by itself), you have a handful of other options for watching Top Rank Boxing online. These streaming apps work on Android , iOS, Fire TV, Apple TV, Chromecast, and Roku devices, as well as any up-to-date web browser (with a few exceptions) — just bear in mind that you still need ESPN+ to watch Top Rank Boxing pay-per-view events like Deontay Wilder vs. Tyson Fury III coming this July.
Hulu includes ESPN in its Live TV plan, which rings in at $77 per month (this includes ESPN along with many other channels, and you can add premium channels like HBO and Showtime for an extra fee), but the better deal is to go for this $13/month bundle that includes a standard Hulu subscription along with ESPN+ and Disney+. You can use Hulu on the Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and Samsung and LG smart TVs along with the devices listed above.
Sling TV bundles ESPN with both its $40-per-month Orange plan and its $55-per-month Orange + Blue plan. This might make it a more cost-effective alternative to Hulu Live for some, but HBO and Cinemax are not available as premium add-on channels. Sling TV can now be used on the Xbox One and Amazon Fire devices, and new members even get a free Fire TV stick when they prepay for two months.
YouTube TV offers more than 70 channels including ESPN for $73 per month but, like Sling, lacks HBO and Cinemax as premium channel options. One nice bonus is that you get unlimited DVR cloud storage for recording things and watching them later. More good news is that YouTube TV can now be used on Fire devices, which it was formerly not compatible with, as well as Xbox and PlayStation consoles.
AT&T TV Now formerly DirecTV Now, has a wide range of subscription plans. The Plus package starts at $65 per month and gives you more than 45 channels including ESPN (which is included in all the tiers), and while it’s not the best value of the bunch, it does include HBO as part of your subscription for no extra fee. Note that AT&T also frequently offers discounted TV packages with its wireless plans , something to consider if you’re looking to switch carriers.
