 Prices started high, with the crypto boom on the verge of collapse, they crashed around the middle of the year, and now GPU prices are holding steady at much more reasonable costs. Or, at least, compared to the massively inflated prices we saw during the GPU shortage.
No GPU shortage here High GPU prices are a different matter GPU outlook for 2023 We‚Äôre not in another GPU shortage , but I‚Äôve still received a handful of messages from readers concerned with how expensive GPUs are right now. As we kick off 2023, I wanted to take a look at the current state of the GPU market and where it might be headed, but more importantly, to decipher the difference between high GPU prices and a true shortage.
No GPU shortage here Jacob Roach / Digital Trends In September, I boldly claimed that the RTX 4090 wouldn‚Äôt cause another GPU shortage.
 If you‚Äôve tried to get an RTX 4090 since launch, I‚Äôm sure you can imagine the proverbial egg on my face. Although I stand by that original point, there‚Äôs some nuance to it, especially months after the RTX 4090 hit store shelves.
Windows is holding back the future of handheld gaming This ‚ÄòSwiss Army Knife‚Äô app transformed how I play PC games The success of AMD‚Äôs FSR 3 hinges on this one feature Let‚Äôs start with the RTX 4090.
 It has remained out of stock since it launched, at least at major retailers like Newegg and Micro Center. You can still buy a new card with marketplaces like Newegg or Amazon, but you‚Äôll spend around $2,200 at minimum. Many cards climb above $2,500.
We have a lot of evidence that suggests we‚Äôre not in a GPU shortage The secondhand market isn‚Äôt much better. $2,000 is the minimum on eBay if you score a deal, but again, you‚Äôll spend $2,200 for the vast majority of cards and even above $2,500 in some cases. That looks a lot like the GPU shortage. Last-gen‚Äôs RTX 3090 retailed for $1,500 ($100 less than the RTX 4090), and at the height of the shortage, it went for around $2,500.
We have a lot of evidence that points in the other direction, though. For starters, Nvidia‚Äôs RTX 4080 has seen pitiful sales.
 Scalpers aren‚Äôt able to sell them for above list price on eBay, and some claim they‚Äôve unsuccessfully attempted to return the cards in droves. According to Wccftech‚Äôs Hassan Mujtaba, Nvidia has shipped more than four times as many RTX 4090s as it has RTX 4080s.
NVIDIA 4080 shipment units: üü¢30,000 NVIDIA 4090 shipment units: üü¢130,000 Total RTX 40 shipment units: üü¢160,000 NVIDIA&#39;s 4090 was pretty much sold out at launch.
Retailers still have 4080 in stock. üò∂‚Äçüå´Ô∏èüò∂‚Äçüå´Ô∏è &mdash; Hassan Mujtaba (@hms1193) November 19, 2022 Even if those numbers are wrong, you don‚Äôt have to look further than the inventory of RTX 4080 graphics cards. On Newegg at the time of writing, there are six models in stock at list price. And at my local Micro Center alone, there are over 30 cards available across two models. Even terrible GPUs like last-gen‚Äôs RX 6500 XT sold out within hours during the GPU shortage, but the RTX 4080 is readily available nearly two months after release.
The same is true of AMD‚Äôs recently launched RX 7900 XT , though not the much more popular RX 7900 XTX. If you‚Äôre shopping for last-gen cards, you can find basically any RTX 30-series or RX 6000 graphics card available from a major retailer.
The situation we‚Äôre in right now isn‚Äôt a GPU shortage. If you recall the past few years, everything was out of stock and marked up on the secondhand market. This case is unique to the RTX 4090 and maybe the RX 7900 XTX, but we‚Äôre still too close to AMD‚Äôs launch to tell.
High GPU prices are a different matter Jacob Roach / Digital Trends We‚Äôre not in another GPU shortage, but the effects of one are still around. High GPU prices still reign supreme. Nvidia‚Äôs CEO Jensen Huang caught a lot of flack for saying falling GPU prices were a story of the past , and rightfully so. But it was an oddly prophetic statement in hindsight.
We‚Äôve covered the RTX 4090, but even the demonstrably unpopular RTX 4080 is much more expensive than it should be. You can find one model, the PNY XLR8 Gaming Verto, for the list price of $1,200. Every other card available sells for $1,300 or more. Board partner cards are always more expensive than list price, but $100 to $200 above after poor sales and an already high MSRP? That‚Äôs hard to justify.
Last-gen options are worse. The RTX 3080 , which should retail for $700, starts at around $900 despite it being more than two years old. Lower down the stack, Nvidia‚Äôs prices are better. The RTX 3060 Ti is about $50 over list price, as is the RTX 3060, and the RTX 3070 Ti is $100 over list price. It‚Äôs important to remember the age of these cards, though. They‚Äôre last-gen, and they should be selling for less than list price at this point.
Jacob Roach / Digital Trends These prices are a situation unique to Nvidia, and AMD‚Äôs GPUs provide a lot of context for where GPU prices should be.
AMD‚Äôs RX 6950 XT debuted at $1,100, but you can find models in stock for around $800 now. Nvidia‚Äôs competing RTX 3090 Ti is available in a refurbished capacity for about $1,200. That‚Äôs a decent cut below that card‚Äôs list price of $2,000, but it‚Äôs also the same price that Nvidia announced back in August 2022.
Similarly, AMD‚Äôs RX 6650 XT is anywhere from $50 to $100 below list price, and the RX 6750 XT (which competes with Nvidia‚Äôs RTX 3070 Ti) is up to $150 below list price. The only outlier here is the RX 6800 XT, which like the RTX 3080 is selling for much above list price (about $200 above list price for AMD and Nvidia).
Jacob Roach / Digital Trends In August, when Nvidia said it had ‚Äúexcess inventory‚Äù of RTX 30-series GPUs , the writing was already on the walls. Nvidia‚Äôs pricing is so much more expensive this generation compared to the previous one. The RTX 4080 is $500 more than the card it‚Äôs replacing, and the rumored RTX 4070 Ti could be similarly more than last-gen‚Äôs RTX 3070 Ti. With much higher prices, Nvidia doesn‚Äôt have to compete with its last-gen offerings, and they can continue to sell at or above list price.
Compare that to what AMD is doing. The RX 7900 XTX and RX 7900 XT occupy the space that last-gen‚Äôs flagships did, forcing prices down. Let‚Äôs not be na√Øve here, though. Although it‚Äôs true that AMD‚Äôs steadfast pricing is lowering the cost of last-gen options, Nvidia holds nearly 90% of the desktop GPU market. AMD needs lower prices to stay competitive. Nvidia doesn‚Äôt.
GPU outlook for 2023 Image used with permission by copyright holder I‚Äôm hopeful that we‚Äôll see a big drop in GPU prices throughout 2023, and for two reasons. The first is the RTX 4080. Customers have voted with their wallets and clearly showed that the pricing of that card is unacceptable, and I don‚Äôt imagine Nvidia will continue to release cards with similar markups if they continue to see poor sales.
The second reason is that we‚Äôre past the flagship phase. Throughout 2023, AMD and Nvidia will release the GPUs lower in their product stacks, and that‚Äôs when we‚Äôll start to see current-gen and last-gen GPU prices really competing. AMD has already put some pressure on Nvidia with its RX 7900 XTX going up against the RTX 4080, as well. In the $300-$500 price bracket, a similarly competitive GPU from AMD would force Nvidia‚Äôs hand.
Still, there‚Äôs no doubt that AMD and Nvidia want to keep GPU prices as high as possible. That‚Äôs why they‚Äôre in the GPU business. Although I‚Äôve praised the RX 7900 XTX here for its competitive pricing against the RTX 4080, it‚Äôs important to remember that AMD‚Äôs RX 7900 XT is also far more expensive than it should be. If AMD had a grip on the GPU market like Nvidia has, we‚Äôd likely see similarly high prices from Team Red.
The real competition is in the midrange where a $50 or $100 difference is all it takes to sway a buying decision. 2023 should bring these midrange cards, and that‚Äôs hopefully when the high GPU prices we see now will start to fade. We‚Äôre out of the GPU shortage, after all.

Editors' Recommendations Don‚Äôt believe the hype ‚Äî the era of native resolution gaming isn‚Äôt over I can‚Äôt get excited about AMD‚Äôs next version of FSR anymore Is a game poorly optimized, or just demanding? They‚Äôre not the same thing Modders just changed GPU overclocking forever Why I leave Nvidia‚Äôs game-changing tech off in most games Features GPUs PC Gaming ReSpec Computing Everyone owes Sony an apology. When the PS5 was announced and Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart was shown off as exclusive for the platform, there was a barrage of finger-pointing at Sony over the game's next-gen exclusive status. The argument from Sony was that the game required the PS5's world-class storage interface, and anything less simply wouldn't work.
Now that the game is available on PC, I can see exactly what Sony was referencing. As you can see from Digital Foundry's first look at the game, it simply doesn't work on the PS4's slow, 5,400RPM hard drive.
Computing There's something so viscerally wrong about seeing Halo on a Mac. Apple's computers aren't known for gaming, sure, but Halo, in particular, looks out of place. It's Microsoft's star child, and it's the franchise Microsoft has hung its hat on for 22 years.
But the game was originally designed for the Mac, and now, you can play it right on your MacBook. Apple's recent Game Porting Toolkit makes all kinds of Windows games playable on the Mac -- in theory. Considering the franchise's storied history with Apple, I gave it a shot to see if the platform is ready for prime time and if I could fulfill the legacy of Halo as a game made specifically for the Mac.
Halo, the Mac exclusive? Computing I'm worried. This past week, AMD announced it was the "exclusive PC partner" for the upcoming Starfield, working directly with Bethesda Game Studios to optimize the game for AMD hardware and getting AMD's FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) up and running in the game (the second, much better version, to be exact).
That's not a problem. It's a good thing. Nvidia and AMD routinely enter co-marketing arrangements with upcoming games. The company promotes the game or bundles a code with a new hardware purchase, and it usually dedicates some engineers to assist with getting features working in the game. Nvidia, for example, recently offered a copy of Diablo IV with the purchase of select RTX 40-series GPUs, and the game supports Nvidia's latest version of Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS).
