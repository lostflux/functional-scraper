Now the Israel-based company has announced a new AI Site Generator that aims to make the process even smoother and more intuitive, and less time-consuming, too.
The update utilizes ChatGPT , the popular generative AI chatbot that burst onto the scene in November and continues to cause a stir.
GPT-4 Turbo is the biggest update since ChatGPT’s launch OpenAI’s new tool can spot fake AI images, but there’s a catch ChatGPT: the latest news, controversies, and tips you need to know Through a text-based discussion with the advanced chat tool, Wix will understand precisely the kind of website you’re looking to build and respond accordingly with an original design, text, and images. The AI Site Generator tool can handle multiple pages, too, and also build in e-commerce features already offered by Wix.
The company shared a video (below) showing how the new feature works.
“What makes it groundbreaking is that it is not a template,” Wix CEO Avishai Abrahami said in a blog post on Monday. “In fact, it’s a unique website designed and tailor-made for you, according to your needs, generated with AI and advanced algorithms.” Abrahami said the design and layout “are completely fitted to the site’s content,” rather than the content fitting a template.
If you want to perform light edits or something more substantial, you can simply continue your conversation with the chatbot to make those changes.
The feature even helps you find the ideal name for your brand by generating unique, catchy, and relevant domain names to choose from.
And for those already with a Wix-powered site, the new AI tool can be used to enhance your pages via a conversation with ChatGPT.
But there could be drawbacks to getting AI to build your website. For example, ChatGPT and other generative AI chatbots are known to “hallucinate” on occasion, a phenomenon whereby it spits out erroneous information presented as fact, usually when it doesn’t know the answer to something. In that sense, the site builder will still need to carefully check some types of content to ensure that it’s correct.
While Wix already incorporates a number of AI tools, the AI Site Generator, which it says will launch soon, brings everything together and is its biggest dive into the technology to date.
Editors' Recommendations The world responds to the creator of ChatGPT being fired by his own company Apple may finally beef up Siri with AI smarts next year Bing Chat just beat a security check to stop hackers and spammers This powerful ChatGPT feature is back from the dead — with a few key changes ChatGPT’s new upgrade finally breaks the text barrier Artificial Intelligence Tech News Computing Most American adults do not trust artificial intelligence (AI) tools like ChatGPT and worry about their potential misuse, a new survey has found. It suggests that the frequent scandals surrounding AI-created malware and disinformation are taking their toll and that the public might be increasingly receptive to ideas of AI regulation.
The survey from the MITRE Corporation and the Harris Poll claims that just 39% of 2,063 U.S. adults polled believe that today’s AI tech is “safe and secure,” a drop of 9% from when the two firms conducted their last survey in November 2022.
Computing Facebook owner Meta is working on an artificial intelligence (AI) system that it hopes will be more powerful than GPT-4, the large language model developed by OpenAI that powers ChatGPT Plus. If successful, that could add much more competition to the world of generative AI chatbots -- and potentially bring a host of serious problems along with it.
According to The Wall Street Journal, Meta is aiming to launch its new AI model in 2024. The company reportedly wants the new model to be “several times more powerful” than Llama 2, the AI tool it launched as recently as July 2023.
Computing People were in awe when ChatGPT came out, impressed by its natural language abilities as an AI chatbot. But when the highly anticipated GPT-4 large language model came out, it blew the lid off what we thought was possible with AI, with some calling it the early glimpses of AGI (artificial general intelligence).
The creator of the model, OpenAI, calls it the company's "most advanced system, producing safer and more useful responses." Here's everything you need to know about it, including how to use it and what it can do.
What is GPT-4? GPT-4 is a new language model created by OpenAI that can generate text that is similar to human speech. It advances the technology used by ChatGPT, which is currently based on GPT-3.5. GPT is the acronym for Generative Pre-trained Transformer, a deep learning technology that uses artificial neural networks to write like a human.
