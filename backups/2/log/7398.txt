 It comes after Lau began to oversee Oppo’s product strategy in addition to his OnePlus duties in 2020, and although it’s not described as a merger, there are aspects that sound like it may be that in all but name.
What do we know at the moment? It sounds positive. Lau writes the integration of the two companies will mean both have more resources to build better products, be more efficient, and provide faster software updates too. The OnePlus name will remain, and Lau states the company will continue to operate independently, complete with its own device release schedule. Perhaps more intriguingly, the post teases working with Oppo may help OnePlus launch a wider choice of devices in the future.
Andy Boxall/Digital Trends OnePlus is well-known internationally, but Oppo will be less recognizable to those outside China, the U.K., and parts of Europe where it has made a significant impact over the past few years. It recently received plenty of attention for the Find X3 Pro , which makes excellent use of its triple camera system, producing consistent results regardless of which one is used.
The integration — let’s not call it a merger — may not surprise many industry watchers though. Both Oppo and OnePlus, along with Vivo, Realme, and IQOO, are part of the BBK Electronics empire, and are technically all related already. OnePlus was co-founded by Pete Lau and Carl Pei, and both worked at Oppo right before starting the new company. There are some similarities in the technology used in both Oppo and OnePlus phones too, including advancements made in fast charging.
One of my favorite Samsung features is coming to OnePlus phones Here’s our first look at OnePlus’ next Apple Watch killer The OnePlus 12 may fix one of the OnePlus 11’s biggest mistakes What does this all mean for OnePlus fans? OnePlus has a significant following, its smartphones are well regarded, and its new models are usually highly anticipated. There’s nothing in Lau’s statement to suggest anything will change this. OnePlus has embarked on a multiyear journey with Hasselblad recently , and we are expecting more from the partnership in the future, regardless of the not-a-merger with Oppo.
How about software? In March it was announced the OnePlus 9 and OnePlus 9 Pro sold in China would use Oppo’s ColorOS software, and at the same time, a commitment to use OxygenOS on global phones was made.
This is good news, as OxygenOS offers a superior user experience to ColorOS. OnePlus launched the Nord CE 5G earlier this week, and the OnePlus 9 series remains as its flagship range. Digital Trends has contacted Oppo for comment on the integration, and we will update here when we hear back.
Editors' Recommendations OnePlus 12: news, rumored price, release date, and more I did a Pixel 8 and OnePlus 11 camera test. Picking a winner wasn’t easy For a $1,700 folding phone, the OnePlus Open has one big flaw OnePlus is about to put the Google Pixel 8 Pro to shame I tried Android 14 on my OnePlus 11 — and I’m not impressed Android News Android Google OnePlus Tech News Mobile OnePlus Pad Go OnePlus OnePlus started its journey making fast phones that didn't cost an outrageous amount of money — a strategy that soon trickled down to earbuds and subsequently made its way to the tablet segment. The OnePlus Pad arrived in April, serving a sleek slate with a high-resolution 144Hz screen and a top-tier chip for a price lower than Apple’s entry-level iPad.
Mobile OnePlus is preparing to launch its next flagship phone in the coming months, but a fresh leak predicts an unpleasant surprise. A few weeks ago, purported renders of the OnePlus 12 depicted a phone that borrows heavily from the OnePlus 11 but adds a rectangular lens element at the back to fit a periscope-style telephoto camera.
Now, leaker OnLeaks (via MySmartPrice) has shared updated renders "based on pre-production unit pictures" that don't show any telephoto lens upgrade. Instead, we have three camera lenses with distinct circular lens inlets and a fourth cutout of the same size without any visible lens element on the camera island.
Mobile Within a span of two days this week, we got the launch dates of new iPhones and Google’s Pixel 8 series phones. Today, OnePlus also made a major announcement, albeit one that has little to do with hardware — or its highly anticipated foldable phone.
It is still a remarkable one, however. OnePlus will release Android 14-based OxygenOS 14 on September 25. That also means the stable build of Android 14 will arrive for supported Google Pixel phones before that date, and likely for some Samsung phones as well.
OnePlus will finally start public testing of Android 14 in the coming days for the OnePlus 11, the OnePlus 11R, and the OnePlus Nord 3. The company has been refining the latest iteration of OxygenOS for the past few weeks as part of a closed beta program. Soon, OnePlus will kickstart the OxygenOS 14 Open Beta program ahead of the stable release.
However, OnePlus won’t be the only brand soak-testing Android 14 ahead of its wide release later this year. Google has seeded multiple public beta builds of Android 14 over the past few months for its Pixel phones, and Samsung has also started testing One UI 6 based on Android 14 for a select bunch of high-end Galaxy phones.
