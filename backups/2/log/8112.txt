What is the Anker 757 PowerHouse portable power station? Image used with permission by copyright holder If you didn’t already know, a portable power station is a relatively versatile system that can charge devices, power electronics, and some appliances, and can even keep the power on during outages in some cases, not necessarily by connecting to your home’s sub-panel. They’re also excellent for off-grid and remote living.
Well, the Anker 757 PowerHouse is one such power station, billed as one of the longest-lasting, and fastest-charging options. It can be charged via solar, with the right panels, or via a wall outlet at home or away. When it’s all charged, you can bring it with you just about anywhere to power up your gear. It works while camping, on a road trip, or even in your backyard if you want to have an outdoor movie night. It’s easy to use, and always ready to go with 13 outlets total, including AC, DC, and USB ports. You can plug in your tablets, phones, computers, small electronics, and so much more. Living in a van down by the river and want some coffee? Plug in a coffee pot and get it brewing.
Powered by LFP (LiFePO4) batteries, it will last for about 3,000 charge cycles, which is six times longer than comparable systems. Moreover, it charges fast, up to 80% in just one hour, so you’re not waiting around long when it does need more power. Even more impressive, it has a 50,000-hour life expectancy rating on all electronic components, which is five times the industry average.
Sounds cool, right? But you’re probably wondering how to enter the sweepstakes and how it all works. We don’t blame you, so keep scrolling.

When it comes to preparing for power-related events, like outages, situations where you might need portable power options, and general usage, you really need some flexible and versatile solutions at your disposal. The more manageable the gear, the more opportunities you have to adapt to current events. For example, let's say your power goes out for a few days to a week. Having a portable power solution will certainly help, but also one that can be recharged via solar energy, reliably, with just a panel or two, will significantly improve your quality of life during that period. Even if the power doesn't come back on in time, you can recharge the station to keep fueling your modern living needs. It doesn't just stop there. Yes, it's great to have backup options in a time of need, but it's also great to just have a handy solution for whatever arises. Maybe you need to power your tools to do some work in the backyard or a workshop, but don't want to run an extension cord? Boom, the portable power solution will help. What if you have a music gig coming up in a remote park or location but need to power your instruments, microphone, and lighting? Cue the portable power solution. There are a lot of different scenarios where having a power device can change the game.
That's precisely what Bluetti is offering with its AC300 and B300 expansion batteries, which offer 3,072 watt-hours of power per battery. You can recharge them via a traditional wall socket, car outlet, or lead-acid battery, but also via solar with a 2,400-watt maximum loading scale thanks to integrated smart MPPT or Maximum Power Point Tracking technology. They're portable, lightweight, and modular, as you can expand the system with more batteries at any time to increase capacity. Plus, you can use them to power nearly everything, from electronics and small appliances to lighting and beyond. To learn a little more about why they're so versatile together and as a system, keep reading.

As convenient as today's mobile devices can be, our over-reliance on electronics is not without problems; namely, having to keep all those mobile gadgets charged when you're on the move. Laptops, smartphones, tablets, smartwatches, wireless headphones, and handheld gaming systems (and this list only goes on) all require regular charging, and if you don't like being tied to a power outlet, then a portable power station is what you need. Growatt, an expert maker of smart home solar power and energy storage equipment, has just the solution in its new VITA 550, a compact and highly portable power station that's the perfect solution for keeping all your gadgets juiced up on the go. It was just released at the CES 2023 trade show with the standard price of $529. If you pre-order it before January 31, you can score a $100 early-bird discount that lets you grab one for $429 for a limited time. Between January 10 and January 31, 2023, you can also use coupon code GroVita550 to get an additional $30 off, bringing the price down to $399.
Pre-Order Now As a solar leader, Growatt has 11 years of experience in the new energy industry, and has supported over three million individuals and families. Growatt's newest product, the VITA 550 features some impressive specs on that front. For example, the 240 watt input support is one of the highest solar intake options in the 500 watt-hour capacity range. It also charges super fast thanks to the 2.5-hour rated charging times via solar, thanks to the high solar input. Most importantly, the 99% MPPT technology delivers a very low conversion loss making the solar generation for the system much more efficient and capable.
We've all run into the situation of needing to charge one or more of our portable electronic devices, only to be nowhere near a power source. It's one of the perennial problems of living in a tech-driven digital age. It's no mystery, then, why portable charging solutions have become so popular, ranging from pocket-sized power banks to large generator-like power stations capable of powering laptops and smaller kitchen appliances. The new Growatt VITA 550 falls somewhere closer to the middle of that spectrum, striking a nice balance between portability and power storage capacity.
