Google filed the lawsuit in a California court on Monday, accusing the Vietnam-based group of creating pages for social media sites — mainly Facebook — that include ads for “Bard” software.
The web giant’s suit says the defendants are “three individuals whose identities are unknown who claim to provide, among other things, ‘the latest version’ of Google Bard for download.” As Google points out in an online post announcing its action against the scammers, Bard is a freely available generative AI tool “that does not need to be downloaded.” Malware is spreading through Google Bard ads — here’s how to avoid them Top authors demand payment from AI firms for using their work All of the internet now belongs to Google’s AI The suit also states that the alleged perpetrators “are not affiliated with Google in any way, though they pretend to be,” adding that they’ve used “Google trademarks, including Google, Google AI, and Bard to lure unsuspecting victims into downloading malware onto their computers.” Before filing the lawsuit, the Mountain View, California company said that since April it has sent around 300 takedown notices to the group behind the fake Bard software, but to no avail.
It added that its lawsuit is seeking an order to stop the scammers from setting up such domains and wants to be able to disable them with U.S. domain registrars. It said that if the action is successful, it will “serve as a deterrent and provide a clear mechanism for preventing similar scams in the future.” In its online post, Google said that scammers are increasingly taking advantage of unsuspecting users as public excitement in new generative AI tools increases. “Our first lawsuit targets bad actors who misled numerous people around the world looking to use Google’s AI tools into unknowingly downloading malware,” it said.
As generative AI has the ability to create natural-sounding text, cybercriminals have also been turning to it to create more convincing scams distributed via email or messaging apps. But Google’s predicament is a little different, with nefarious types exploiting the recent hype surrounding AI to roll out software purporting to offer the same features but actually containing little more than malware that can lead to all sorts of trouble for any unsuspecting individuals who install it.
Editors' Recommendations OpenAI’s new tool can spot fake AI images, but there’s a catch Google Bard could soon become your new AI life coach Google Bard can now speak, but can it drown out ChatGPT? The best AI chatbots to try out: ChatGPT, Bard, and more Google tells workers to be wary of AI chatbots Artificial Intelligence Google Tech News Computing MusicLM is one of Google's experimental artificial intelligence (AI) tools that uses natural language models to interpret your instructions. But instead of chatting to you like ChatGPT, or helping you search, like Bing Chat, MusicLM is an AI that takes what you tell it and creates music based on it.
You'll need to join the waitlist to get access, but once you're in, you can start making music with Google's latest AI tool.
Computing Ever since Microsoft started integrating ChatGPT into Bing search, alarm bells have been ringing at Google. Now, though, the tech giant has started rolling out its own generative artificial intelligence (AI) tool for users as part of its bid to retain its search crown.
In a blog post, the company explains that the new feature (called Search Generative Experience, or SGE) is part of Google’s Search Labs, which lets you test out experimental ideas in Google search and provide feedback to the company. Google says its generative AI will “help you take some of the work out of searching, so you can understand a topic faster, uncover new viewpoints and insights and get things done more easily.” Computing These days, it seems like everyone and their dog is working artificial intelligence (AI) into their tech products, from ChatGPT in your web browser to click-and-drag image editing. The latest example is Adobe Photoshop, but this isn’t just another cookie-cutter quick fix -- no, it could have a profound effect on imagery and image creators.
Photoshop’s newest feature is called Generative Fill, and it lets you use text prompts to automatically adjust areas of an image you are working on. This might let you add new features, adjust existing elements, or remove unwanted sections of the picture by typing your request into the app.
