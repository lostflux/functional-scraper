Here’s what you need to know By Anita George Close YouTube recently announced that it would be rolling out handles for YouTube channels.
 Whether you’ve just heard about them or you already got an email from YouTube saying it’s time to choose one, you’re probably wondering what they are and how they’re different from YouTube channel names.
What is a YouTube handle? Are they different from YouTube channel names? When can users choose a handle? How do you choose a handle? In this guide, we’ll go over what a YouTube handle is and answer a few questions about them so you can better understand what they are and be better prepared to choose one when it’s rolled out to you.
What is a YouTube handle? YouTube handles are another way to identify your YouTube channel, but they are separate from YouTube channel names. They’re similar in appearance to the usernames you’ve seen on Twitter and TikTok. Example: @DigitalTrends. Once created, YouTube handles also come with a URL to match that follows this format: youtube.com/@[handle name].
With handles, all YouTube channels will have one, along with a custom URL, regardless of how many subscribers a channel has. Once the handles rollout has been completed, handles will start appearing in places like search results, the Shorts tab, comments, and mentions.
YouTube makes it easier for new creators to earn money YouTube relaxes rules around swearing and demonetization What is BeReal? Are they different from YouTube channel names? Yes. Channel names are separate identifiers for a given YouTube channel. While multiple YouTube channels can have the same channel name, YouTube handles are meant to be totally unique to each YouTube channel. So with this latest update, your channel will have a channel name, a handle, and a URL. The handle is expected to help make finding your specific channel and connecting with the correct creator easier.
When can users choose a handle? YouTube officially announced the launch of its handles on October 10, and one of the announcements said that YouTube would roll out the ability to choose a handle to users “over the next few weeks.” When YouTube is ready for you to choose a handle for your channel, it will notify you via email and YouTube Studio. That’s when you’ll be allowed to choose one. You’ll then have until November 14 to choose a handle.
According to its help guide on the matter , if you don’t choose one by then, YouTube will automatically assign you one “based on your channel name.” How do you choose a handle? You’ll have to wait until YouTube notifies you (via email and YouTube Studio) that it’s ready for you to choose a handle. When that happens, you can then go to youtube.com/handle to pick a handle for your channel.
There are guidelines that your chosen handle must meet: It must contain numbers and letters. They can be uppercase or lowercase. A handle can also have hyphens, underscores, or periods.
The handle can’t already be claimed by another channel. Remember, they have to be unique.
It cannot violate YouTube’s Community Guidelines.
It can’t resemble a URL or phone number.
It should be between three and 30 characters long.
Note: YouTube has said that, usually, if your channel already has a personalized URL, your YouTube handle will default to the “unique part” of that URL. But YouTube will still let you change that handle if you want.

What is Twitter Blue and is it worth it? What is Mastodon? Here’s why everyone’s talking about this Twitter alternative Computing Apps YouTube Social Media It might be a good idea to review and change your two-factor authentication options for Twitter. Elon Musk's Twitter has another issue for its users to worry about.
Twitter has reportedly been having issues with its SMS two-factor authentication feature (2FA). According to Wired, beginning as early as this past weekend, some Twitter users have reported difficulties logging in to their Twitter accounts due to the app's SMS 2FA feature not working properly. Essentially, the feature relies on the app sending users an authentication code via text message, which they can then enter as a second step in the login process.
Social Media Instagram appears to be down right now, but the glitch many users are reporting is an odd one. It's not just that users are having trouble accessing the popular photo- and video-sharing app, but they're also having trouble accessing their own accounts and have reported being hit with account suspension notices.
On Monday morning, the apparent Instagram outage was reported by users on Twitter and on Downdetector. Both sites included numerous reports saying that users suddenly lost access to their IG accounts and were given account suspension notices.
Social Media YouTube is updating its user interface with a slew of changes, and chief among them are the pinch-to-zoom feature and "precise" video navigation.
On Monday, YouTube announced quite a few updates to its viewing experience on mobile and web. Notably, the video-sharing platform said that it was finally "launching pinch to zoom and precise seeking to all users starting today."
