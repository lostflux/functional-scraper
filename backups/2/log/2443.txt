The biggest improvement is expanded access, with Matter now supported by nine more different types of devices, including fridges, dishwashers, laundry machines, air purifiers, robot vacuums, and other common smart home gadgets.
While Matter has long been praised for its ability to connect products designed for different ecosystems (allowing you to use HomeKit items with Amazon Alexa , for example), it was held back by its limited rollout. When it first launched, only a handful of categories were supported — such as smart bulbs, smart plugs, and smart sensors.
CSA Update 1.2 is changing that. Here’s a look at all the new smart home device types now supported by Matter.
Refrigerators Dishwashers Laundry washers Air purifiers Room air conditioners Robot vacuums Fans Air quality sensors Smoke and carbon monoxide alarms Aside from adding support for these groups, Matter has seen core improvements to its underlying software (such as semantic tags to help program controls and the use of generic descriptions to make it easy to generate new device types). These changes aren’t nearly as exciting, but they’ll help developers roll out features faster and with more accuracy.

Amazon brings Matter support to 17 Echo devices Now that Matter 1.2 is available to everyone, the team is focused on big changes for 2024. According to the official blog from the Connectivity Standards Alliance, it’s expecting Matter to “continue to expand” at a rapid pace throughout 2024.
“Turning the calendar to 2024, Matter will continue to expand its footprint across the smart home, across the [Internet of Things] ecosystem, and in the minds of consumers. New products will come to market, filling out existing Matter device types and being among the first in the new Matter device types debuting with Matter 1.2. We expect that Matter will receive two new updates next year as part of the biannual release cadence — which should add even more device types and expand into new areas.” Editors' Recommendations Alexa vs. HomeKit: Which smart home platform is best? What is Apple HomeKit? The future of Matter in 2023 Google rolls out Matter support for Nest and Android Matter Launch Day Event brought big news about future updates, compatible products Amazon Apple Google Google Nest Internet of Things (IoT) Tech News Smart Home After running into a few roadblocks, Matter is officially here. Announced by the Connectivity Standards Alliance (CSA), the Matter certification program is now live, allowing manufacturers to bring the tech to their products and release them on an expedited timeline.
Matter is big news in the smart home community, as it will serve as a universal framework that allows different ecosystems to interact with each other. For example, your Alexa-enabled devices will be able to use Matter to communicate with your Apple HomeKit products. Its goal is to streamline the setup process for smart home devices and build an ecosystem that’s easy to use while bringing together products and software from Samsung, Google, Apple, and over 280 other collaborators.
