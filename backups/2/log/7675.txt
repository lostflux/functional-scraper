Why trust us? What’s new on Amazon Prime Video in November 2023 By Blair Marnell Close There are only two months left in 2023, but Amazon Prime Video saved one of its best original shows for November.
Invincible is back for its second season on Friday, November 3, and it takes superhero action to the next level. Much like Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse , Invincible is able to do more with the comic book style and storylines in animation than anything in live-action can match. It’s also a show that isn’t afraid to go into darker territory.
The Christmas movies are also out in force this month on Prime Video, including eight different VeggieTales Christmas flicks … which seems excessive. Fortunately, there’s a lot of non-holiday fare to enjoy, like the first five Fast and Furious films, as well as Master And Commander: The Far Side of the World , which is celebrating its 20th anniversary this month.
