Known as StagingTool, this mechanism can activate or disable features that are hidden and unannounced within Windows 11 Insider Preview software. While there are third-party versions of such tools that can find and enable hidden features within developmental software, including ViveTool and Mach2, StagingTool is essentially Microsoft’s official version. However, it is not intended for public use.
The tool was uncovered during a “bug bash” event, in which Microsoft gives people several tasks to complete and share their feedback via its Windows Feedback Hub. Microsoft typically gives participants badges through the Feedback Hub, but those involved in this particular bug bash went away with an extra prize. A link for StagingTool was included in the bug bash quest that was actually meant for internal testers.
Surprise: Windows 11 is doing much better than we thought The best Windows 11 themes Windows 11 adoption is slowing, and we finally know why Though Microsoft has since closed that bug bash quest, StagingTool has already been leaked and is making its rounds across the internet. Those who have accessed the tool describe it as a “command line interface.” It requires “feature IDs,” many of which can be found on GitHub, to activate or disable features, depending on the build of Windows 11 Insider Preview that is being released.
Microsoft often rolls out features to its Windows Insider Preview program that don’t make it to the final build of operating systems. However, with users now having the ability to override the system to find and enable whatever hidden features they want, Microsoft might have to rethink its methods of A/B testing.
Other details that surfaced in the leak include murmurs of “Moments,” which might be the future name of Windows 11 feature drops. This isn’t something Microsoft has yet mentioned publicly, but internal evidence of the brand’s plans has circulated for at least a year, Windows Central noted.

Microsoft Microsoft Windows Tech News Windows 11 Computing From smart speakers to ChatGPT and Bing Chat, AI has slowly crept into our lives, but not all instances of AI are as prominent as those three examples. Sometimes, the effect is subtle, but still pretty nice. It appears that Microsoft is working on one such instance of AI-enhanced tech that could make using Windows 11 just a little more pleasant. We're talking about AI-powered live wallpapers, and they might be coming soon.
First spotted by Windows Latest, Microsoft is readying an AI-powered desktop that could make the whole user experience feel a lot more interactive. The idea is to adjust depth perception and make some backgrounds appear more "alive" when moving your cursor or the entire device. The wallpaper might move or shift, depending on what you're doing on the desktop.
Computing Microsoft makes it easy to change the default browser in Windows 11. That's important if you require special features specific to one of the many web browsers that are available on a PC. Unfortunately, it's not as simple to be rid of Edge entirely.
Microsoft Edge will still load to open some other file types. When opening a link from Windows Settings or other system components, the webpage will load in Edge. That's now about to change, however, according to a recent Windows blog post.
Computing Microsoft is currently testing a feature that allows users to switch between the local Windows 11 installation and a cloud-based Windows 365 Cloud PC installation on a device using just basic computer commands.
The feature, called Windows 365 Switch, is available for Windows Insiders in the Beta and Dev Channels. The Windows 11 Build 23521 to Insiders in the Dev Channel recently became available for Dev Channels.
