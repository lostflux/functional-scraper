Why trust us? The bestselling video games of all time By Joseph Yaden Close Although sales aren’t the only metric relevant to how good a game is, it’s a decent measurement of how influential certain titles have been over time. With this list of the bestselling video games of all time, we’ll take a look at the cream of the crop.
Some interesting notes before diving in: Many of the titles below were included as part of a hardware bundle at some point, with the exception of a small handful of games. Several are also exclusive to one console — mainly Nintendo games. It’s also worth noting that many of the sales stats for the following games are a couple of years old at this point and are likely higher today.
These are the bestselling games of all time.

All Super Mario Bros. Wonder power-ups, ranked 6. Super Mushroom Gaming The Victrix Pro BFG is getting an upgrade in the form of new modules that feature Hall Effect joysticks. Those who own the modular controller will be able to purchase the new pieces in early 2024 either as a a two-pack or individually.
Released last year, the Pro BFG is a unique third-party controller that allows players to swap out several components on the fly. That includes taking out its joystick modules and slotting in a fight pad, or switching the orientation of the sticks to match PlayStation and Xbox layouts. Victrix will not double down on that design by releasing a standalone module that replaces its joysticks with those using Hall Effect technology.
