Why trust us? The best iPhone games in 2023: 31 games you need to play right now By Mark Jansen and Christine Romero-Chan Close Andy Boxall / Digital Trends When you have the best iPhone , you pretty much have infinite possibilities for keepingbusy and entertained, no matter where you are. Sure, the iPhone may not be marketed as a gaming phone specifically, but it’s pretty powerful — especially with the A17 Pro in the latest iPhone 15 Pro.
 That new processor means the Apple mobile gaming experience is only getting better and better, with Apple’s new chip being able to play console-level games like Assassin’s Creed Mirage and the Resident Evil 4 remake.
While those games aren’t available yet, there’s no shortage of great games to play. But when the App Store has over a million apps, how are you supposed to find the best games to play? Don’t worry — we’re here to help! Since there are a ton of games out there — and not every game is a winner — it’s definitely hard to find games that are worth your time and energy. Whether you’re looking for a simple match 3, an MMORPG, a dungeon crawler, or even something to just relax with, here are the best iPhone games you can play right now.
Most, if not all, of the titles we are recommending will work on any iPhone that has iOS 17 on it, which goes as far back to the iPhone XS.
 If you’re still on iOS 15 or 16, then you should also be fine with these titles. Make sure to also check out our list of the best iPhone apps.
 And if you’re an Android user, don’t miss our best Android games roundup.
Save on everything from laptops and tablets, to coffee makers and air purifiers, and a whole host of Apple tech like iPad, Apple Watch and even the latest M3 MacBooks, as well as smart home essentials like the Amazon Echo and smart bulbs.
Call of Duty: Mobile Mark Jansen / Digital Trends Assassin’s Creed and Resident Evil may only just be making their way to iOS, but Call of Duty: Mobile has been delivering a console-like experience for years now. If you want to get your shooting on, then here is a great place to start. You control the game with the on-screen buttons and joystick, and while it takes a little getting used to, it becomes natural fairly fast.
Call of Duty: Mobile isn’t short of updates either, with new seasonal events and updates dropping very regularly, so you don’t need to worry about running out of content or getting bored easily. Support for the game goes all the way back to the first iPhone SE and iPhone 6S, so it’s available for most iOS users out there. It’s free to play, but it has microtransactions.
iOS Clash of Clans Supercell It’s one of the most popular classic games on iOS, so we’d be remiss if we didn’t include Clash of Clans on here. You’ve probably played it or something like it, but it’s always good to jump back in and see what’s new. For the uninitiated, Clash of Clans has you build your own cartoon village, collect resources, and gradually build it up over time. You can also join with other players to attack opposing clans and become involved in massive wars across the globe. It’s free-to-play, but you can pay for boosts and all the usual microtransactions.
iOS Dumb Ways to Die 4 Metro Trains Melbourne Pty Ltd It’s huge on TikTok, and for good reason: Dumb Ways to Die 4 is a collection of fun minigames where your challenge is to stop your bean from dying. This is, unsurprisingly, the fourth major release in the Dumb Ways to Die canon, but you don’t need to worry that the developers are running out of ideas. There’s a big new collection of minigames to solve and beans to save, collect, and upgrade. You can even go online and challenge your friends and family to see who can survive for the longest. It’s free, but you can pay to remove ads and get extra in-game currency.
iOS CarX Street Image used with permission by copyright holder Racing games are one of the best showcases of a phone’s graphical abilities, but it’s not all about the good looks.
CarX Street puts you in the shoes of a street racer in a dynamic open world. Take up races, beat your rivals, and become the best driver in the city. There’s an intricate car upgrade system, and you can tune your car for certain races, tune up the specs, and change the style and design too. It works best with the iPhone X or newer due to the memory demands.
iOS My Singing Monsters Image used with permission by copyright holder If we asked you, “What do monsters do?” you probably wouldn’t reply, “Sing, of course!” Regardless, that’s what your monsters in My Singing Monsters do. Collect and breed up to 250 monsters on your island, and hear your song change and grow over time. Add decorations to customize your island, and you can play with friends around the world and partake in worldwide events all year around. It’s free-to-play but does have microtransactions.
iOS Stick Fight: Shadow Warrior Image used with permission by copyright holder Live that kung fu film dream and fight off hordes of enemies with your martial arts skills in Stick Fight: Shadow Warrior.
 Endless waves of foes will spawn, and it’s up to you to survive for as long as you can. Take on boss samurais to unlock rewards, and take on more difficult levels. As you fight, you also unlock cool new cosmetics and items, so your stick fighting can look even cooler. A fun casual fighting game that’s ideal for bored fingers.
iOS Marvel Snap Marvel seems to be really enjoying releasing mobile games these days, as Marvel Snap is only the latest of a number we’ve had thrown at us recently. Still, it’s really good and well worth your attention. Essentially a card battling game, Marvel Snap is fast-paced, and battles rarely lost longer than a few minutes. Gameplay is simple: Each of your cards has a strength number, and your job is to place them into any one of three lanes facing your opponent. If your number is higher, you win! But watch out, more than a few cards have special powers that can swing lanes in an instant, so you need to make sure you’re playing the right cards at the right moments. It’s free to play, but you can pay to get access to in-game currency and new cards.
iOS Among Us! Image used with permission by copyright holder It’s a classic, and it’s back on our list.
Among Us! is one of the best hidden killer, mafia-style games around, and it’s brilliantly suited to being played on mobile. Work together with four to 15 players to get your ship ready for launch — but there’s a twist! A number of players are secretly Imposters who want to murder everyone else on the team. Your job, if you’re not an Imposter, is to fix your ship while also figuring out who the Imposters are. Seeing them enter vents, doing things they shouldn’t, or just murdering people are clues you should be looking out for — but keep in mind you’ll need to convince everyone else you’re not lying … iOS Airport Simulator: First Class Image used with permission by copyright holder Apparently, we’re a little addicted to plane games at the moment, but this time you’re not flying one, you’re giving them somewhere to land.
Airport Simulator: First Class puts you in charge of an airport. Build it up, sign up airlines to your amazing new airport, and make sure everything is in place for all of your customers. There’s a lot to juggle here, but if you love management games then there’s a lot to love here. It’s free-to-play, but there are the usual in-game boosts for real money, so avoid this if you don’t like those.
iOS Stumble Guys Image used with permission by copyright holder Stumble Guys may seem a little familiar if you’re a fan of battle royale party games, but that doesn’t detract from how much fun it is.
Stumble Guys is an online multiplayer party game where you go up against 31 other players in a bid to be the last person standing in a series of fun games. Knock your rivals off the stage and reach the end first to win. It’s a lot of fun, with lots of different levels to tackle. It’s especially fun if you get a bunch of friends together to play — and then knock them all out and take the win yourself.
iOS Cell to Singularity: Evolution The idle game genre is an interesting one and something that’s largely exclusive to the smartphone.
Cell to Singularity: Evolution starts with the humble amino acid in a simulation, ruled over and overseen by yourself. Tap the screen to increase your resources, or just leave your phone alone for a while and let them build up by themselves. Use the points gained to upgrade those acids into DNA, single cells, multiple-celled organisms, and beyond. There’s a simple pleasure to watching the numbers increase, and eventually, you’ll be able to unlock the dinosaur and galaxy simulations as well. Restart each simulation to access upgrades and, well, keep making numbers bigger. If you don’t get it, you’ll be confused about why these games are so popular, but if you’re a fan, you’ll love this.
iOS Hearthstone Image used with permission by copyright holder It’s the biggest and (arguably) the best digital collectible card game on mobile, so if you love playing competitive card games, then Hearthstone is a must-download. The premise is simple — play minions and cast spells to control the gameboard, and eventually, punch your opponent in the face until they lose. But there’s a depth to this simple premise, and you can spend hours finely tweaking your decks to adapt to the latest meta. It’s free to play, and you can buy card packs using the in-game currency and earn powerful cards through the in-game rewards track. However, you’re going to be encouraged to spend money to get more cards quickly, so gird your wallet if you’re diving in head-first.
iOS The Lord of the Rings: War Image used with permission by copyright holder The Rings of Power has reignited our love for everything Tolkien, so why not play a game set in the same universe? The Lord of the Rings : War is set in Tolkien’s beloved fantasy creation and puts you in the shoes of a faction of Middle-earth. Fight against the other factions for the One Ring, recruit new commanders, and even forge your very own ring of power. A large amount of Middle-earth is available to adventure through as you build your team and create an enormous army. It’s free to play, but it does have microtransactions.
iOS Games of Thrones: Conquest Game of Thrones is back in the public eye with the release of House of the Dragon , and if you can’t get enough of everyone’s favorite quasi-medieval series, then you should try out Game of Thrones: Conquest.
If you’ve played any city builders before, then the format will be familiar to you — gather resources, fortify your army, and create buildings. As you might expect, given the lore, you’re given a dragon to raise and protect, and you’ll be able to use it with your armies to expand your influence and create great alliances. You can also gather hero cards and assign them to your council to get bonuses.
iOS Dragon Ball Z Dokkan Battle Dragon Ball Z holds a special place in many people’s hearts, and there’s no shortage of games set in Akira Toriyama’s manga-turned-anime.
Dokkan Battle is a slightly different twist on the franchise’s formula, and while the high-octane, chi-fueled battles remain, they’re through the medium of matching colored orbs. Tap the right orb to send your energy up to your enemy and hit them with super-strong special moves. It’s difficult to explain but easy to pick up and worth a quick download if you’re interested in the legendary series.
iOS Red’s First Flight Image used with permission by copyright holder Ignore the terrible name — this is Angry Birds.
 Yes, the original version, with no in-app purchases and nothing to distract from the sheer joy of destruction. Take apart the precarious fortresses of those greedy pigs with nothing but the noggins of your furious avian friends and, if needed, the Mighty Eagle as a backup. You’ve probably played this before and saw the original you loved disappear behind troves of microtransactions and “upgrades.” Pay your dollar, go back to the original, and just enjoy the simple fun of Angry Birds.
iOS Northgard Image used with permission by copyright holder We’re big lovers of large beardy people in pointy helmets around here, and Northgard is just the game we’ve been waiting for.
Northgard is a survival game, but instead of controlling a single, beleaguered explorer, you control a group of Vikings looking for new lands. Manage your scarce resources and Vikings carefully, as you’ll need to balance both in order to survive this harsh land of undead warriors and dire wolves. There’s a multiplayer mode and a single-player storyline, and you’ll need to master the different skills of the six clans in order to conquer both. While it’s on the expensive side for an iOS game, there’s no doubt that Northgard offers hours of fun for just $7.
iOS Albion Online Previous Next 1 3 Image used with permission by copyright holder Image used with permission by copyright holder Image used with permission by copyright holder MMORPGs are nothing new, but what about an MMORPG that can be played on a PC, Mac, Android, or iOS device? With the same account and the same characters? Add a completely player-driven economy, a class-less system where your class is dictated by your outfit, and an endgame that lets guilds compete for vast swathes of Albion in enormous open-world battles and you’ve got a game that is very interesting indeed. If nothing else, it’s worth experimenting with.
Albion Online is free-to-play, but as you might have guessed, it has paid elements and a premium subscription for the truly hooked.
iOS Sid Meier’s Civilization VI Image used with permission by copyright holder A PC gaming staple, Sid Meier’s Civilization VI is now an exceptionally good iOS game as well. While it’s easier to enjoy on a larger screen, like on an iPad , it still works extremely well on an iPhone. The game puts you in charge of an emerging historical civilization, and you must make the big decisions that decide whether your people spread and flourish, or struggle and diminish. Start in the stone age, and develop your technology, taking your civilization through thousands of years, until you’re capable of putting people on Mars. It’s free for the first 60 turns but costs $10 to upgrade to the full game.
iOS Zombie Gunship Survival Previous Next 1 2 Image used with permission by copyright holder Image used with permission by copyright holder Surviving the zombie apocalypse is a genre we’ve encountered many times before, but we doubt you’ve ever faced it from the gunning position of an AC-130 gunship.
Zombie Gunship Survival is the perfect antidote if you’re sick of slowly building up your resources and hitting zombies with sticks. Instead, jump straight into your gunship and blow them all to kingdom come. Build up your airbase to defend against zombie attacks, and personally lead your troops in tactical operations against the dead. Some reviews complain about microtransactions, but others mention it’s a fairly light touch compared to other games. Worth the download for something new.
iOS Sim Companies Image used with permission by copyright holder Reckon you could run a great business, if only you were given the chance? Give it a go in Sim Companies.
 Specialize your company in a number of different ways, and test your capitalist skills against other players as you battle to become the top dog. Your success will come down to how well you can watch the virtual economy and watch out for trends you can take advantage of. It’s free-to-play, but there are microtransactions.
iOS Infinite Flight Simulator Previous Next 1 2 Image used with permission by copyright holder Image used with permission by copyright holder The humble flight sim is one of PC gaming’s finest traditions, and it’s now arrived on your iOS (or iPadOS) device. There’s almost too much to do here to list, and pretty much everything you expect from a flight sim you’ll get here. Sure, it’s a bit overwhelming at first, but flying a plane isn’t easy, and neither is Infinite Flight Simulator.
 You can also fly in multiplayer or play as a flight controller, though you’ll need to pay for a Pro subscription for that at the cost of $10 a month. Still, flying a basic plane is free, and it offers everything you need to know whether this is your jam or not.
iOS Diablo Immortal Image used with permission by copyright holder The game infamously revealed with the words “do you guys not have phones?” has finally launched, and despite the outcry, it’s actually pretty good.
Diablo Immortal is here, and if you’re a fan of the Diablo games or anything similar, then you’re sure to love it. The genius here is that this isn’t some cheap mobile imitation — this is a fully-fledged Diablo game in all its glory, and that makes a serious difference. Alright, it’s rammed to the gills with microtransactions, but if you want to sample the game everyone is talking about, then you’ll just have to hold your nose.
iOS Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga Image used with permission by copyright holder Star Wars is a huge franchise at the moment, thanks to Kenobi , so why not enjoy a great Star Wars game? Star Wars: TCS is a port of the 2007 Lego Star Wars game of the same name and has content from Star Wars I to Star Wars VI , so don’t expect anything from the sequel trilogy in this. But regardless of that, you get to play through the six mainline movies, starting in the Trade Federation negotiations and fighting your way through to the second Death Star above Endor. There are over 120 characters to play, and you’ll need to use other characters’ strengths to get all the secrets in every level. It’s free to start playing, with Episode I unlocked for free. Subsequent episodes will cost money, though you can buy the full game for $7.
iOS Square Valley Square Valley puts you in the shoes of the Spirit of Valley, whose purpose is to take a square of land and make it habitable for incoming villagers. You’ll need to place houses for them to live in, animals to farm, rivers for water, and trees for wood. The trick is that each portion of the land can only take certain tiles, so you’ll need to balance what you place where. It’s a fun and engaging concept, and one that should tickle puzzle lovers for hours. A bargain for just $2.
iOS Medieval II: Total War Image used with permission by copyright holder Older gamers will remember when games like Medieval II: Total War was new and technically demanding — and now, you can play them on your iPhone or iPad. It costs a princely sum of $15 to buy, but there’s a full PC game here, and one that’s been converted rather well. Play as one of 17 playable factions, and fight, scheme, and trade your way to building your empire. Like Rome: Total War , the battle gameplay takes a little getting used to, but once you’ve got the hang of it, it’s just as easy to use as on the PC.
iOS PUBG Mobile Image used with permission by copyright holder You might think of PUBG Mobile as being a buttoned-up, brown version of Fortnite ‘s colorful explosion, but that’s not the case. The fourth anniversary of PUBG Mobile ‘s brought with it a number of new features. There’s a vibrantly colorful theme, colorful bicycles, and an aerial battlefield mode that’s utterly bonkers and unlike anything else you’ve seen in a battle royale game. Other than that, you can still find the classic gameplay you love, along with 10-minute matches, and a massive range of aesthetic items to collect and wear.
iOS ARK: Survival Evolved Image used with permission by copyright holder What’s better than a survival game on your iPhone or iPad? A survival game on your iPhone or iPad with dinosaurs! ARK: Survival Evolved is now something of a classic of the survival genre, and it’s easy to see why it’s still around when so many other games have dropped off the radar. You’ll start the game by, well, surviving — but once you have that solid base in place, you can start to set your sights a little higher. Create a home all your own, and train, tame, and even ride over 80 different dinosaurs.
iOS Fill the Fridge! There are few games so easily described by their title but Fill the Fridge! is exactly what it sounds like. Fill your fridge with delicious goodies that are currently not in your fridge. Weirdly, dragging your finger along to place goods becomes quite compulsive and fun, and, if you’re anything like us, you’ll find yourself playing for far longer than you’d originally intended. It starts out simply, but levels soon become fiendishly difficult and require some quite precise button presses to accomplish.
iOS Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Links Sitting alongside Pokémon as the childhood game of choice for many people, Yu-Gi-Oh can now be enjoyed on your iPhone or iPad.
Duel Links has a strong tutorial in order to teach you the rules, so don’t worry if you’ve never played before, or are a little rusty. There are microtransactions, but they’re not required to progress, and you can get a lot of free cards from playing the in-game events. A good choice if you’re curious about playing a collectible card game, are an existing Yu-Gi-Oh player, or simply want to indulge in some nostalgia.
iOS Mario Kart Tour Who doesn’t love Mario and his happy band of friends and foes? Mario Kart Tour is the mobile version of the madly popular and decade-spanning Mario Kart series. It’s a simple formula — choose a character and race against other characters, whether A.I.-controlled or player-controlled — and aim to take first place. Win races, collect stars, and unlock new characters, karts, and badges. It’s free to play but has optional paid elements.

Apple iPhone 15 -- $60 per month Mobile Waiting on an iPhone upgrade? Now is the time to pounce, as the newest additions to Apple's legendary roster were confirmed at its September 2023 event.
