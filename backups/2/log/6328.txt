Aqara launches U100 smart lock with full Apple HomeKit support Smart Lights Tech News Smart Home After a lengthy public preview, the new Google Home app is officially launching on May 11. The redesign boasts a few highly requested features, along with a fresh UI that makes it easy to navigate even the most cluttered of smart homes.
Announced during Google I/O, the new Google Home app features five tabs -- Favorites, Devices, Automations, Activity, and Settings. Upon launching the app, you’ll be greeted by the Favorites tab, where you’ll find a list of your most-used gadgets. Devices are also automatically placed into categories such as Lighting and Cameras so you can quickly bounce between menus without any fuss.
Smart Home After debuting at CES 2023, the Dynamic Effects Neon-Shape Smart Lights from GE Lighting are now available for purchase. These highly customizable lights can be controlled using the Cync smartphone app, but also use a built-in microphone to adjust their performance in real time based on the audio of their surroundings.
The Dynamic Effects Neon-Shape Smart Lights actively listen to your home to detect sounds coming from nearby music, video games, or other activities to provide an immersive lighting experience. It’s a nifty feature -- and one that should help set it apart from the competition. You’ll also be able to use the built-in microphone to issue voice commands, and you can control the lights with Amazon Alexa or Google Home.
Smart Home Google Home gives you access to a wide variety of smart home devices, and garage doors have now joined the party. Support for smart garage controllers is rolling out to select users -- although it only appears to be available to folks previewing the new Google Home app and does not yet have an official release date.
Still, seeing the product category added to any version of Google Home is great news for smart home enthusiasts. Google Home is one of the most widely used smart home platforms on the market, and as smart garages continue to gain traction, it’s nice to see their inclusion in the app (even if they’re still not as popular as smart thermostats or video doorbells).
