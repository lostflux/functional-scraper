Why you should buy the 43-inch Samsung Odyssey Neo G7 4K gaming monitor Samsung places several monitors on our list of the best gaming monitors , and among the best 4K gaming monitors is the Samsung Odyssey Neo G7.

These combine with Quantum Matrix Technology to create an unrivaled visual experience no matter what your favorite type of game may be.
And with modern gaming, the rigors of real-time gaming action can be a lot for a monitor to handle. Many monitors provide a refresh rate of 60Hz, but the Odyssey Neo G7 has refresh rate of 144Hz. This eliminates lag and provides for smoother gameplay, even during fast-paced action and multiplayer play. AMD FreeSync Premium Pro also chips in to reduce screen tearing, stuttering, and input latency.
