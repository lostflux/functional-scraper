Earlier this week, Hulu officially ushered in the Huludays with a lineup of Christmas movies that includes some genuine classics of the season, as well as some made-for-TV films with a few familiar faces.
Many of the Christmas films on Hulu are celebrating anniversaries in 2023, including our favorite Christmas action film, Die Hard , which is marking its 35th anniversary. However, Hulu will only be streaming Die Hard through November 30. The majority of the other incoming Christmas anniversary flicks will arrive on Thursday, November 23, including Four Christmases (15th anniversary), Jack Frost (25th anniversary), and Elf (20th anniversary).
New Line Cinema Other holiday arrivals on November 23 include National Lampoon’s Christmas Vacation , The Polar Express , and Fred Claus.
 Perennial favorites like both versions of Miracle on 34th Street , Adam Sandler’s Eight Crazy Nights , The Muppets Christmas Carol , The Family Stone , and The Santa Clause 3: The Escape Clause are already streaming.
Hulu is also debuting a handful of new Christmas films this week, including A Christmas Frequency starring Denise Richards as a radio show host who may find new love during the holidays after her marriage comes to an end.
Reporting For Christmas has a similar premise, as a lovelorn reporter named Mary (Tamara Feldman) is assigned to interview small town toy manufacturer Blake (Matt Trudeau). Romantic sparks inevitably fly.

But the holiday spirits are going to have to teach Alexis what she’s missing out on by giving up on love. The final new addition of the week is Marry Liddle Christmas , which features Kelly Rowland as Jacquie, an entrepreneur whose desire for a “perfect Christmas” faces some daunting challenges as she reconsiders her romantic future.
Even more Christmas movies will be added to Hulu in December, with the full lineup coming in a few weeks.

This month, our picks include Tom Cruise in a film unlike any of his previous blockbusters, as well as a cult classic robots-versus-aliens movie, and the final installment of a cult-classic film trilogy. These are the three sci-fi movies on Hulu that you need to watch in November.
Edge of Tomorrow (2014) Entertainment Action movies can get you amped up for a big day to come, or even out of a bad mood. They often feature high-speed chases, intense fight scenes, and maybe even a bit of sci-fi. They can be set just about anywhere and usually include great fight choreography and/or visual effects, sometimes even thought-provoking storylines when you dig deeper beneath the surface.
The best action movies on Prime Video include a diverse mix of titles, both old and new. When it comes to three action movies on Prime Video you need to watch in November, they all include A-list casts and one even spawned a franchise that is going strong after two decades.

Streaming services and linear channels will be gearing their programming for the holidays in November and December. From Santa Claus and Christmas trees to presents and snowstorms, expect a lot of movies and shows about Christmas and the holiday season.
