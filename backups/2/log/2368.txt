Why trust us? Is the OnePlus 11 waterproof, and does it have an IP rating? By Andy Boxall Close You’re about to buy a OnePlus 11 , but want to know if the phone has any degree of protection from the wet stuff. Is the OnePlus 11 waterproof, and does it have an IP rating ? The OnePlus 11 is waterproof (sort of) Why the OnePlus 11’s IP64 rating is important This is an important question to ask before buying any smartphone.
 As careful as you may think you are with your devices, life happens. All it takes is one accident to drop your phone in the sink, get caught in the rain with it, or for it to take a tumble in the pool. If you have an IP rating, these things aren’t a big deal. But if not, you’re in for a headache.
The OnePlus 11 is waterproof (sort of) Andy Boxall/Digital Trends The good news is, yes, the OnePlus 11 has an IP64 rating, but before you rush off and buy the phone thinking it’ll survive a dunking in the bath, we better explain what that actually means.
One of my favorite Samsung features is coming to OnePlus phones The best Android tablets in 2023: the 10 best ones you can buy The OnePlus 12 may fix one of the OnePlus 11’s biggest mistakes An IP64 rating means the OnePlus 11 has a degree of protection from both water and dust. The first number refers to solids rather than liquids, and a six is the maximum amount of dust protection measured on the IP rating scale. It means the OnePlus 11 is entirely sealed from dust, so it cannot enter the device and cause havoc inside that may prevent it from working. This is good news.
The second number refers to the amount of protection the device has against water ingress. A four is the mid-way point on the scale, and it means the OnePlus 11 is protected against splashed water and has been tested against ingress for a period of 10 minutes. It does not mean the OnePlus 11 will survive being immersed in water, or if it’s hit by strong jets of water. So while waterproof isn’t the right word, it’s fair to say the OnePlus 11 is water-resistant.
Why the OnePlus 11’s IP64 rating is important Joe Maring/Digital Trends OnePlus hasn’t always put its smartphones through the IP-rating process and has, in the past, simply said some of its phones are splash-proof without backing the claim up with an IP rating. The IP64 rating given to the OnePlus 11 gives you some additional confidence in the phone’s ability to function if it gets wet. Just don’t think it means the OnePlus 11 is waterproof , as it most definitely isn’t. It is a step up from the IP54 rating given to the OnePlus 10T , but it can’t match the IP68 rating given to the iPhone 14 and the Pixel 7.
The IP64 rating joins two other key durability features on the OnePlus 11.
 The back is made from Gorilla Glass 5, while the screen is covered in Gorilla Glass Victus , so the body will offer a decent degree of protection in the event of a short accidental fall. It’s always worth wrapping your phone up in a case, though, as this will help it survive if the fall is on a hard surface.
Editors' Recommendations OnePlus 12: news, rumored price, release date, and more Here’s our first look at OnePlus’ next Apple Watch killer The best Android phones in 2023: the 16 best ones you can buy OnePlus is about to put the Google Pixel 8 Pro to shame Best OnePlus 11 deals: Save $100 on the Android phone OnePlus Mobile OnePlus Pad Go OnePlus OnePlus started its journey making fast phones that didn't cost an outrageous amount of money — a strategy that soon trickled down to earbuds and subsequently made its way to the tablet segment. The OnePlus Pad arrived in April, serving a sleek slate with a high-resolution 144Hz screen and a top-tier chip for a price lower than Apple’s entry-level iPad.
Mobile OnePlus is preparing to launch its next flagship phone in the coming months, but a fresh leak predicts an unpleasant surprise. A few weeks ago, purported renders of the OnePlus 12 depicted a phone that borrows heavily from the OnePlus 11 but adds a rectangular lens element at the back to fit a periscope-style telephoto camera.
Now, leaker OnLeaks (via MySmartPrice) has shared updated renders "based on pre-production unit pictures" that don't show any telephoto lens upgrade. Instead, we have three camera lenses with distinct circular lens inlets and a fourth cutout of the same size without any visible lens element on the camera island.
Mobile Within a span of two days this week, we got the launch dates of new iPhones and Google’s Pixel 8 series phones. Today, OnePlus also made a major announcement, albeit one that has little to do with hardware — or its highly anticipated foldable phone.
It is still a remarkable one, however. OnePlus will release Android 14-based OxygenOS 14 on September 25. That also means the stable build of Android 14 will arrive for supported Google Pixel phones before that date, and likely for some Samsung phones as well.
OnePlus will finally start public testing of Android 14 in the coming days for the OnePlus 11, the OnePlus 11R, and the OnePlus Nord 3. The company has been refining the latest iteration of OxygenOS for the past few weeks as part of a closed beta program. Soon, OnePlus will kickstart the OxygenOS 14 Open Beta program ahead of the stable release.
However, OnePlus won’t be the only brand soak-testing Android 14 ahead of its wide release later this year. Google has seeded multiple public beta builds of Android 14 over the past few months for its Pixel phones, and Samsung has also started testing One UI 6 based on Android 14 for a select bunch of high-end Galaxy phones.
