Why trust us? GPU prices and availability (Q4 2023): How much are GPUs today? By Jacob Roach and Monica J. White Close The GPU shortage is over , and gamers around the world can breathe a sigh of relief. For those in the market for one of the best graphics cards , we closely looked at graphics card prices and availability to see where the GPU market is headed and to figure out the best time to buy.
When will graphics card prices drop? Nvidia GeForce Ada Lovelace RTX 40-series Nvidia GeForce Ampere RTX 30-series Intel Arc Alchemist AMD Radeon RDNA 3 RX 7000 AMD Radeon RDNA 2 RX 6000 Should I buy a new GPU now or wait? FAQs about GPU prices If you’re looking for a cheap GPU deal , now is the time to buy. Cards from both AMD and Nvidia usually hover around the recommended list price, but some models are actually priced well below that.
Here’s the state of affairs for GPU pricing in the fourth quarter of 2023.
23% of PC gamers probably can’t play Alan Wake 2. Here’s why Newegg wants your old GPU — here’s how much you could get AMD might still have some next-gen GPUs left in the tank — but I don’t buy it When will graphics card prices drop? Image used with permission by copyright holder GPU prices have largely returned to normal , and only a select few are selling above the list price. Graphics cards are in stock at retailers, which has cut off scalpers at the knees with inflated prices. The GPU market is in good shape now, with cards on the secondhand market selling for below list price, as they should.
Prices have normalized across most of the popular retailers, and a few recent GPU launches didn’t make much of a splash, which means that these cards are now up for grabs for less than expected, or — at the very least — they’re available at list price. In the past, you’d have to wait for weeks for the prices to drop on a new GPU, but these days, the availability often exceeds demand. Some new GPUs have also come out recently, filling the market with viable and affordable graphics cards.
Moreover, there are still plenty of older graphics cards in stock, which belong to the RTX 30-series and RDNA 2 lineup. Those GPUs are often budget-friendly options, and many of them make great alternatives to high-end current-gen cards.
Nvidia GeForce Ada Lovelace RTX 40-series Jacob Roach / Digital Trends GeForce RTX 4090 Nvidia’s RTX 4090 is the cream of the crop when it comes to GPU power (read our RTX 4090 review to see it in action), and it comes with a price to match. The base price is $1,600, and some third-party models are as much as over $2,000. The RTX 4090 has been getting pricier in the last few months, so if you’re hoping to buy one, you’ll most likely have to pay $1,650 or more.
Soon after launch, the card was mostly sold out across the board, and that was one of the last chances for a while for scalpers to make some coin. These days, you can find plenty of RTX 4090s in stock, so head directly to retailers instead of buying second-hand — unless you spot a great (and safe) deal on a gently used card.
GeForce RTX 4080 Nvidia followed up the RTX 4090 with the RTX 4080, and that GPU is also readily available. Although not as impressive as the flagship card (read our RTX 4080 review for more), it’s still a powerful GPU with Nvidia’s latest architecture. It’s a little less worth the money for the price than the RTX 4090, though, which means that you may find some models at up to $150 less than the recommended list price.
GeForce RTX 4070 Ti Nvidia’s RTX 4070 Ti isn’t a great GPU, as you can read in our RTX 4070 Ti review , and that’s mainly because it’s too expensive. The card was released at $800, and while some third-party retailers sell it for up to $900 or even $1,000, you can find many models near (or at) list price because of the lukewarm reception that the card had received upon hitting the market. The cheapest models actually dip a little below that, reaching around $770.
GeForce RTX 4070 Between several GPUs that could easily be referred to as less than stellar, the RTX 4070 shines bright. It’s a reasonable GPU where the numbers finally add up. It’s not too expensive, but it delivers decent performance in 1440p and does an outstanding job of handling 1080p games. If it suits your budget, it’s a decent halfway point in this generation. You can find several models below their initial list price of $550.
GeForce RTX 4060 Ti 16GB Nvidia launched not one, but two versions of the RTX 4060 Ti this year. The 16GB version is virtually the same as the 8GB model, but it adds an extra $100 to the recommended list price and packs twice as much video memory. However, Nvidia launched this card very quietly , and it didn’t even make its own Founders Edition of it either. While it’s mostly available for sale, it’s not as popular as the 8GB version due to the poor performance per dollar. On the upside, there are some models that are actually $50 cheaper than the recommended list price of $500.
GeForce RTX 4060 Ti 8GB While many had high hopes for the RTX 4060 Ti 8GB, its performance is not quite as great as expected, as you can see in our review of it.
 Due to the limited amount of VRAM and narrow memory bus, the card may struggle against some of the most demanding games that are already out, let alone the titles that are still yet to come. However, if you want a midrange card to slot inside your next PC build , the good news is that the RTX 4060 Ti 8GB is available at most retailers at list price or slightly below it, with some models dipping down to $380.
GeForce RTX 4060 In the previous generations, the xx60 GPU was always a fan favorite. The RTX 4060 may not quite earn that spot, but it’s affordable enough to still climb the ranks over time. We’ve reviewed it and found it to be an average competitor against AMD’s recent RX 7600, but it is a bit faster, and it unlocks Nvidia’s DLSS 3 , so there are still plenty of reasons to pick it up. It launched at $300 and has maintained that price ever since.
Nvidia GeForce Ampere RTX 30-series Jacob Roach / Digital Trends.
GeForce RTX 3090 Ti Although the RTX 3090 Ti should sell for a decent price now, it doesn’t. You’ll struggle to find any models in stock, and the ones that are available sell for above $1,800, with some reaching a crazy $3,400. Because of that, we’re omitting it from this list. Nvidia likely restricted the number of RTX 3090 Ti models it released as a late addition to the previous generation, so we may never see it back in stock at list price.
Read our RTX 3090 Ti review to see how the card performs.
GeForce RTX 3090 Although the RTX 3090 is much older than the RTX 3090 Ti, it’s still not any cheaper than its initial list price, and many models are actually a good couple of hundred dollars pricier. The card launched at $1,500, and while you can find some models around that ballpark, it’s also mostly out of stock. These days, there is no reason to buy a new RTX 3090 — you’re better off adding an extra $100-$200 and getting the RTX 4090 instead, or dropping down to an RTX 4080 which outperforms it.
GeForce RTX 3080 Ti The RTX 3080 Ti is one of the few graphics cards in the Ampere generation that sells for well below its initial MSRP, and that’s probably because of how ridiculously overpriced it was when it first launched at $1,200. You can find new models for around $950 to $1,200, and in the lower end of that bracket, the card still makes some sense — but you’re most likely better off with an RTX 40-series GPU. Read our RTX 3080 Ti review for benchmarks.
GeForce RTX 3080 The RTX 3080 was a sweet-spot graphics card for high-end gamers when it launched. With a list price of $700 and uncharted performance — read our RTX 3080 review for more on that — it was the graphics card to buy. You may struggle to find it in stock outside of refurbished models right now, and while those are cheap, they can be risky.
GeForce RTX 3070 Ti The RTX 3070 Ti is an updated version of the RTX 3070, packing in more cores, a faster clock speed, and higher memory bandwidth. It launched for only $600, but you’ll spend closer to $500 now. Overclocked models aren’t much more expensive, but you might end up paying up to $100 more. Read our RTX 3070 Ti review to see it in action.
GeForce RTX 3070 Much like the RTX 3080 and RTX 3080 Ti, it’s much harder to find the RTX 3070 compared to its Ti sibling. And you’ll pay about the same price. The RTX 3070 launched at $500, but most models run around $550, saving you only $100 or so compared to the Ti model. At this point, it’s better to just buy an RTX 4070.
GeForce RTX 3060 Ti The RTX 3060 Ti is a popular graphics card, which makes sense. It’s among the best 1080p graphics cards you can buy, with enough power for 1440p in some titles. It launched for $400, but you can sometimes get it for around $330 to $360 now. Overclocked models are a bit more expensive, running toward $400 to $450 for a boosted card tricked out with RGB. If you can find a good deal on this card, it’s not much slower than the RTX 4060 Ti (and even faster in some titles), but it doesn’t have DLSS 3.
GeForce RTX 3060 The RTX 3060 is an oddball graphics card, launching for $330 shortly after the Ti version. Some models are now cheaper, while better versions remain around the original list price, dipping as low as $250 at times. Some overclocked models sell for over $400, but those are few and far between, and usually not worth it when there are next-gen options already up for grabs. For a full breakdown of performance, make sure to read our RTX 3060 review.
GeForce RTX 3050 Nvidia’s RTX 3050 is a solid option for gamers on a budget — read our RTX 3050 review for a full breakdown of performance — but it’s still selling for above list price. The cheapest cards run around $330, but you could spend up to $400 for an overclocked model. That’s a solid increase compared to the $250 price the card launched at.
Intel Arc Alchemist Jacob Roach / Digital Trends Arc A770 Intel’s Arc A770 was a surprise hit (read our Arc A770 and A750 review ), mostly due to its price. Intel has two models, one with 8GB of memory and another with 16GB. The 8GB model launched with a $330 price tag, while the 16GB model was priced at $350. Intel doesn’t have as many board partners as AMD and Nvidia, which is why these GPUs are few and far between, but you can still find them in stock for as low as $250 at times, although the ballpark of $300 is more common.
Arc A750 The Arc A750 is similar to the A770. It’s just slightly behind in performance and, consequently, slightly cheaper. The list price is $250 after Intel slashed the price , but you may find Intel’s own reference model for $240. Some of its add-in board (AIB) partners sell their cards for $220 to $230.
Arc A580 Almost a year after the rest of the lineup, Intel quietly launched the Arc A580 — and as the reviewers say, it’s not very impressive.
 The problem lies not with its performance, but rather with its price. It’s behind the Arc A750 in capability, but it’s only around $20 to $30 cheaper. It makes very little sense to buy right now.
Arc A380 Intel’s less-popular A380 is available, and there are a couple of models available ranging from $120 to $130. This card is far behind in performance and seemed more like a proof of concept for Intel Arc than a competitive release. It’s still in stock, but don’t expect top-tier gaming performance.
AMD Radeon RDNA 3 RX 7000 Jacob Roach / Digital Trends Radeon RX 7900 XTX As you can read in our Radeon RX 7900 XTX and RX 7900 XT review , AMD’s new graphics cards are seriously impressive. The flagship XTX model debuted at $1,000, and you can sometimes find it for a little below that at around $950. In terms of performance, it’s close to Nvidia’s RTX 4080, but read our review to see precise benchmarks.
Radeon RX 7900 XT AMD’s RX 7900 XT is considerably less impressive than the XTX model, and because of that, you can find it readily available at retailers at below list price. Some third-party cards have even been discounted following a lukewarm reception to the GPU.
Radeon RX 7800 XT The Radeon RX 7800 XT is a long-anticipated fresh arrival in the RDNA 3 lineup that finally bridges the gap between the high-end GPUs and the entry-level RX 7600. It’s also one of the best GPUs to buy at this price range, as you can read in our review of it.
 It launched at a recommended price of $500 and usually hovers around $520 right now, which makes it a go-to for 1440p gaming.
Radeon RX 7700 XT While the RX 7700 XT brings more of a generational upgrade than the RX 7800 XT, it also makes much less sense to buy. The cheapest models hover around $440, which is far too close to the RX 7800 XT to make much of an impact, and there are also RDNA 2 options to consider at around the same price.
AMD is really its own worst competitor right now , and this is a GPU where it truly shows.
Radeon RX 7600 AMD’s RX 7600 is an affordable graphics card that offers decent performance for 1080p gaming. In our review , we’ve found that it’s slightly slower than Nvidia’s RTX 4060, but it’s also a little bit cheaper. You can usually find it for anywhere between $260 and $300, so it makes for a solid choice for a budget-oriented PC build.
AMD Radeon RDNA 2 RX 6000 Jacob Roach / Digital Trends Radeon RX 6950 XT The Radeon RX 6950 XT is an updated version of the RX 6900 XT, bringing clock speed and memory bandwidth improvements (read about those in our RX 6950 XT review ). It launched for $1,100, but it’s way, way cheaper now. Seeing as this is a 4K gaming card, it’s still a solid option if you’re building a high-end PC but don’t need a GPU from this current generation.
Radeon RX 6900 XT The RX 6900 XT originally launched for $1,000, but you can find new models for around $750 these days. As you can see, that actually makes it a worse deal than the 6950 XT, which is an interesting twist. The RX 6950 XT used to provide worse value before, but now, it’s often the better option unless you can score a decent deal on the RX 6900 XT.
Radeon RX 6800 XT The RX 6800 XT marks the sweet spot for 4K gaming in AMD’s RDNA 2 lineup, so it remains a popular card. Fortunately, its pricing has dipped well below the initial list price. These days, you can find an RX 6800 XT for around $500, and at that price, it’d be a steal … if not for the RX 7800 XT which costs pretty much the same.
Radeon RX 6800 The cut-down RX 6800 hasn’t had the same attention as the XT version, but it is around $100 cheaper. It launched for $580, but fortunately, these days you’ll only need to spend around $4500 to get your hands on this card. However, it makes for a reasonable alternative to the $520 RX 7800 XT.
Radeon RX 6750 XT The RX 6750 XT is an updated version of the RX 6700 XT, and just like the other RX XX50-series cards, there are plenty of them in stock. Buying it now means great savings compared to when it initially launched at $550, as these days, you’re only spending around $360 to $400.
Radeon RX 6700 XT The RX 6700 XT launched for $480, but it sells for considerably less now, saving you around $150. We found models around $320, but some overclocked models go up to $700. Needless to say, the card is not worth anywhere near that much, but it’s a good deal for $320. Although the RX 6700 XT technically lives alongside the RX 6750 XT, we imagine this model will be phased out over time in favor of the updated version.
Radeon RX 6650 XT The RX 6650 XT is among the RDNA 2 refresh lineup, and it replaces the RX 6600 XT — though, keep our RX 6600 XT review handy in case you find a card in stock. The card launched for $400, but you’ll now find it for as low as $235, making it a competitive option against the current-gen RX 7600.
Radeon RX 6600 XT AMD’s Radeon RX 6600 XT used to be one of the more popular graphics cards in the lineup, but the competition it faces from its siblings is fierce. While you can find it for around $270, you can also get the RX 6650 XT for less, so this GPU doesn’t make a whole lot of sense right now.
Radeon RX 6600 The RX 6600 is a cut-down version of the RX 6600 XT, and it comes in at a cheaper price: $210. There are some cards in stock for that price, though many sell closer to $250. The problem is inventory, as the RX 6650 XT has pushed many of the models off digital shelves. Make sure to read our RX 6600 review to see how the card stacks up.
Radeon RX 6500 XT The RX 6500 XT was launched to compete with the RTX 3050 for a slightly lower price of $200. As you can read in our RX 6500 XT review , it’s one of the worst graphics cards ever released, which explains why you can pick one up for as little as $170. It’s a deal, but you’re not getting much of a graphics card for that price, so really, steer clear unless you have no other option.
Radeon RX 6400 If you’re looking for a true budget graphics card, the RX 6400 is your only modern option outside of Intel’s scarcely available Arc A380. It launched with a recommended price of $160, and the vast majority of cards sell for around that price (give or take $20). We couldn’t find any cards above $200. Keep in mind, though, that the RX 6400 is less focused on gaming, so you’ll only find options in small-form-factor configurations.
Should I buy a new GPU now or wait? Image used with permission by copyright holder After a long period of inflated prices, GPUs are finally settling into the new normal. The so-called “new normal” means that they’re as cheap as they’ve been in years. While we’re not back to the pre-pandemic state, we might never go back to that due to the pricing strategy adopted by Nvidia, and, to a lesser extent, AMD.
Current-gen cards are available at most retailers, and the stock levels are more than high enough to meet the current demands. Some GPUs that were launched in 2022 and 2023 have already seen some price cuts, and even those that haven’t are up for grabs at the list price.
In other words, we don’t recommend waiting. Now is the time to buy a GPU. Last-gen graphics cards are plentiful and cheap (especially AMD models), and current-gen offerings aren’t as overpriced as they were upon launch. With the next generation of Nvidia GPUs slated for 2025, there is no reason to wait until then — buy now while the prices are finally acceptable.
FAQs about GPU prices Why are GPUs so hard to find? Fortunately, the days of GPUs being hard to come by are well and truly behind us. These days, minor shortages occur when a new product launches, but we’re out of the woods. It’s hard to say what the future will bring, though, so now is actually a good time to buy a graphics card.
For a bit of a history lesson, in 2021, there was a GPU shortage , which is why GPUs used to be so hard to find. The coronavirus pandemic caused a chip shortage, making it difficult for Nvidia and AMD to produce enough cards to keep up with demand. Demand was at an all-time high in 2021, too, as cryptocurrency miners rushed to pick up graphics cards from shelves.
Throw scalpers into the mix, who capitalized on demand from gamers and cryptocurrency miners, and it’s easy to see why GPUs were so expensive. Simply put, graphics cards used to be hard to find because the demand was much, much higher than the supply. Now, with higher stock levels and lower demand, it’s a whole different story.
Are GPUs still out of stock in 2023? No, GPUs are not still out of stock in 2023. You can find Nvidia RTX 40-series and AMD RX 7000 graphics cards at most retailers, as well as on eBay. Cards are not only in stock now, but they’re also mostly selling for around list price. Last-gen options are plentiful, too, with Nvidia’s RTX 30-series and AMD’s RX 6000 both cheaper than ever outside of some models.
When will GPU prices return to normal? Graphics cards are cheaper now than they were in 2021, and prices have continued to drop. Although some models are still overpriced, it’s safe to say that GPU prices have returned to normal now.
It’s possible that prices will rise again near the end of the year, but it’s hard to say for sure right now.
Will old GPU prices drop? Older graphics card prices are dropping with the rest of the market. However, many old GPUs are really cheap now, and this especially includes some of AMD’s RX 6000 cards. Nvidia’s RTX 30-series still maintains high (or insanely high) prices in some cases, but other models, like the RTX 3070 Ti, are fairly reasonable.
Still, it’s important to remember that with new GPUs selling at list price, it often makes more sense to buy a newer card at a similar cost — although the old GPUs are perfectly sufficient for most gamers.

Computing Confirming previous rumors, Nvidia released its RTX 4060 Ti on Tuesday without much fanfare. Most of the best graphics cards release with a bang, but the updated 16GB RTX 4060 Ti released with barely a whimper. Nvidia is putting more weight behind Portal: Prelude RTX, on the same day it's launching a new graphics card. Weird.
This is the 16GB variant that Nvidia promised when the original 8GB RTX 4060 Ti was released in June, and although it has technically been released, you can't buy it.
