Musk, CEO of Twitter (now X), said in a tweet on Wednesday that changing the way that it‚Äôs charged would maximize the amount that creators on Twitter would receive when followers subscribe to their exclusive content.
Specifically, he said he‚Äôd prefer it if Apple took 30% of the subscription fee that Twitter holds onto, rather than 30% of the entire subscription cost.
Super Important to Support Creators! If you can afford it, please subscribe to as many creators on this platform as you find interesting.
People from every corner of the world post incredible content on ùïè, but often live in tough circumstances, where even a few hundred‚Ä¶ &mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 2, 2023 It‚Äôs not the first time that Musk has made his feelings known about Apple‚Äôs 30% fee. In November last year, shortly after acquiring Twitter in a deal worth $44 billion, Musk tweeted that ‚Äúapp store fees are obviously too high due to the iOS/ Android duopoly,‚Äù adding: ‚ÄúIt is a hidden 30% tax on the internet.‚Äù Cook ended up inviting Musk to Apple‚Äôs headquarters in Cupertino to discuss this and a number of other matters, and despite having what Musk described as a ‚Äúgood conversation,‚Äù Apple‚Äôs 30% fee stayed well and truly in place.
That‚Äôs why few people expect Apple to change its position this time around, after all, the tech giant hardly has a reputation for flexibility when it comes to its App Store fees.
In the same tweet on Wednesday in which Musk mentioned that he‚Äôll be contacting Cook, he also laid out an updated set of rules regarding monetization for Twitter creator accounts, which also receive a portion of ad revenue.
‚ÄúWhile we had previously said that X would keep nothing for the 12 months, then 10%, we are amending that policy to X keeps nothing forever, until payout exceeds $100k, then 10%,‚Äù he wrote, adding that Twitter will not take a cut of any revenue made in the first 12 months.

Are Apple‚Äôs hands clean? Apple Apps Tech News Twitter Mobile The next evolution of wireless technology, Wi-Fi 7, has been hitting its stride in recent months. Now, MediaTek is giving it a big boost with a duo of new Filogic chips that will power a whole new generation of Wi-Fi 7-capable devices, from enterprise access points and wireless mesh systems to smartphones and set-top boxes.
Unsurprisingly, MediaTek was one of the first chipmakers on board when Wi-Fi 7 made its debut at CES 2022, promising to deliver top speeds more than twice as fast as current Wi-Fi 6 and Wi-Fi 6E technologies. While Wi-Fi 7 is still in its nascent stages ‚Äî few consumer devices support it, and the spec has yet to receive its final ratification ‚Äî MediaTek‚Äôs second-generation Filogic chips will ensure that smartphones, laptops, and routers are ready to deliver the best of what the new standard has to offer.
Mobile Google's popular line of Pixel devices includes smartphones, tablets, smartwatches, and wireless earbuds -- and they're all available with eye-catching discounts in this year's Black Friday deals. if you've had an eye on any one of them, you should take advantage of the offers that retailers have rolled out for the shopping holiday, and you need to act fast because stocks will run out quickly due to high demand. To help you out, we've rounded up our favorite Google Pixel Black Friday deals below.
Google Pixel Watch Black Friday deals The Google Pixel Watch 2 is already out, which means the Google Pixel Watch is a prime candidate for a discount on Black Friday. It's still a perfectly capable smartwatch though, even with the launch of its successor, as it runs on Google's Wear OS for access to a wide range of apps and health-monitoring features on your wrist. You need to push through with your purchase as soon as possible though, as stocks are already probably running low on most Black Friday smartwatch deals.
Mobile One of the biggest promises of 5G technology isn‚Äôt merely faster performance but rather the ability to power a far more connected world ‚Äî a global network where every device can get online from just about anywhere.
That‚Äôs the vision behind MediaTek‚Äôs new M60 5G modem and T300 chip, which aim to be small and efficient enough to bring 5G to wearables, internet-of-things (IoT) devices, and other electronics that benefit from reliable internet connectivity but don‚Äôt require the massive speed and bandwidth of modern laptops and smartphones.
