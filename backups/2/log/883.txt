Wolfe Close If you have blocked a phone number on your iPhone and wish to unblock it, you can easily do so in just a few steps. This can be helpful if you've accidentally blocked a number you didn't mean to, have made up with an ex, made good with a friend you were having a dispute with, or in other circumstances.
How to unblock a phone number on iPhone How to unblock a contact Whether you have an iPhone 15 , iPhone 15 Pro , or an older version, the steps to unblock a number are the same.
Difficulty Duration What You Need An iPhone There are two distinct methods you can use to unblock someone through your iPhone, depending on whether they are listed in your Contacts app.
Digital Trends How to unblock a phone number on iPhone Hastily blocking a phone number on your iPhone probably involved a number not associated with a contact. This could have been a telemarketer, scammer, bill collector, or more.
Step 1: To get started, select the Settings app on your iPhone. Next, scroll down, then choose the Phone option.
Digital Trends Step 2: Select Blocked Contacts.
Swipe left next to the contact you wish to unblock. Tap Unblock.

Digital Trends As you can see, unblocking someone on your iPhone is a relatively pain-free process. Just perform a few steps and you're good to go! Editors' Recommendations It looks like the iPhone 16 will get a big design upgrade It’s finally happening — your iPhone is getting RCS in 2024 The iPhone is getting out of control One of our favorite Android phones just got its own iMessage app This iPhone 15 and iPhone 14 camera test is closer than I expected Apple Apple iPhone How-To Guides Mobile The iPhone has so many clever and fun little features that it's easy to miss some of them. One of the most whimsical features to come along in recent years is the ability to lift the subject of a photo away from the background so you can use it elsewhere — whether that's sharing it in an email, pasting it into a photo editing app, or even turning it into an iMessage sticker in iOS 17.
What's especially fascinating about this is that it seems like such a simple thing to do — and Apple does make it really easy — but there's a ton of number crunching going on under the hood to make it happen. This means you'll need an iPhone with a reasonably modern processor, but the good news is that it doesn't have to be the latest and greatest iPhone 15 Pro. While the insanely powerful A17 Pro chip in Apple's flagship smartphone surely helps things along, this feature can be used on any iPhone with an A12 Bionic chip or later, which goes back to the 2018 iPhone XS and iPhone XR.
Mobile Duolingo is a top-rated language-learning app known for its unique approach to learning. Unlike similar solutions, Duolingo makes learning fun and engaging by turning each step into a game. Whether using the app on your iPhone or Android, you can choose from over 30 languages to learn. Adding another language to your account is easy once you are ready to move on to the next one.
Mobile I’ve been using an iPhone ever since 2008, starting with the original and then every generation since. For several years, the iPhone was only capable of SMS texting, with MMS support arriving with iOS 3 in 2009.
But in 2011, Apple created something new: iMessage. It first arrived on iOS and then went to the Mac in 2012 to replace iChat. iMessage is basically an instant messaging service that is exclusive to all Apple products: iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and Mac. You can send text, images and video, documents, rich preview links, stickers, and more between one another. You can also see if a message is delivered, send read receipts (if you want), and everything is encrypted. With iOS 16, you can even edit and unsend messages within a certain time frame.
