Why trust us? The best free Nintendo Switch games By Jesse Lennox Close The Nintendo Switch offers an unparalleled gaming experience, allowing you to enjoy games big and small, no matter whether you’re on the couch or on the go. That said, Switch games rarely receive a discount, even if you’re constantly checking for the best Nintendo Switch deals.
 Our list of the best free Nintendo Switch games is here to help.
We’ve rounded up the top free-to-play games on Nintendo Switch, from Switch Online exclusives like Tetris 99 and Pac-Man 99 to third-party hits like Fortnite and Rocket League.
Keep in mind that although all of the games below are free to start, they all feature microtransactions in one form or another. However, we restricted our picks only to games that have ethical microtransactions (no pay-gating or anything like that).
Save on everything from laptops and tablets, to coffee makers and air purifiers, and a whole host of Apple tech like iPad, Apple Watch and even the latest M3 MacBooks, as well as smart home essentials like the Amazon Echo and smart bulbs.

That, of course, includes the Nintendo Switch, where this colorful and wacky battle royale feels most at home. This game has you compete in various obstacle courses in various rounds until only one victor reaches the crown. The physics are loose and unpredictable in all the best ways, making it fun even when you lose due to the sheer absurdity of what’s going on.

That means you can get tons of gaming chairs, including some of the best gaming chairs, for incredibly low prices. At this point, one deal is sticking out to us like a sore thumb. As a result, we'll be putting extra attention on it during this article. However, if you want a more comprehensive list of great early Black Friday gaming chair deals, we've got them at the bottom.
Best gaming chair Black Friday deal The blue AKRacing Core Series EX Gaming Chair is our favorite Black Friday deal so far, and for many reasons. To start with obvious factors, it is discounted by over 25%. You can get your blue AKRacing Core Series EX Gaming Chair for $280 today, while it would be $400 on a regular day. That's a savings of $120. Another big factor is that it is an official Best Buy Black Friday deal, and is labelled as such. That gives us a ton of confidence in its price being the best price available.
Gaming Every gamer needs a gaming headset, whether for a more immersive experience during single-player adventures or to properly communicate with your teammates during online multiplayer matches. If you don't have one yet, or you want to upgrade from a basic model, you should consider going for the Logitech G733 Lightspeed wireless gaming headset, which is on sale from Amazon at 20% off. Instead of $150, you'll only have to pay $120 for savings of $30, but you'll have to proceed with your purchase quickly because there's no telling when this bargain will get taken down.
Why you should buy the Logitech G733 Lightspeed wireless gaming headset The Logitech G733 Lightspeed wireless gaming headset is a popular choice among shoppers, with an average rating of 4.5 stars out of 5 stars on Amazon after nearly 14,000 reviews. Similar to the best gaming headsets, it offers excellent audio quality with Logitech's PRO-G drivers that minimize distortion and surround sound that makes you feel like you're in the middle of the action. When speaking to other players, your voice will be crystal clear thanks to the Logitech G733 Lightspeed's broadcast-quality microphone, and it's also certified for Discord, a chat app that's designed specifically for gamers.
Gaming The PlayStation 5 is looking to dominate the console landscape with its incredible library of games. Like the rest of the industry, Sony saw several major game delays in 2022 (and more this year), but has since dropped several new hit games like God of War Ragnarok, the Resident Evil 4 remake, and Alan Wake 2, among others. There are plenty of games out on PS5 for every kind of gamer.
And there are plenty more great titles on the way — don't forget to check out our list of the best upcoming PS5 games that will come out later this year.
