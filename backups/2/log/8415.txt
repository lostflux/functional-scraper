Indeed, more than 60,000 people have already died in such events this year alone.
Ever since scientists discovered what causes these awful catastrophes, they’ve also been trying to predict them in a bid to save lives and reduce damage. But the way in which tectonic plates behave as pressure builds up between them makes the task of forecasting earthquakes incredibly difficult.
However, researchers at the University of Texas (UT) recently reported an exciting breakthrough that utilizes an AI-generated algorithm to predict the timing, location, and intensity of an earthquake.
Are we about to see ‘the iPhone of artificial intelligence’? Spotify using AI to clone and translate podcasters’ voices AI drone beats pro drone racers at their own game In trials that took place in China over a period of seven months, the algorithm accurately predicted 70% of earthquakes a whole week before they occurred.
It forecast 14 earthquakes within a 200-mile area of the estimated epicenter and also made a very accurate forecast regarding their intensity, a report on the university’s website said. It failed to warn of just one earthquake and gave eight false predictions.
The research team trained the AI to detect statistical bumps in real-time seismic data that the research team had paired with previous earthquakes, the report explained. Once trained, the AI monitored for signs of approaching earthquakes.
“Predicting earthquakes is the holy grail,” said Sergey Fomel, a professor at UT’s Bureau of Economic Geology and a member of the research team, adding: “What we achieved tells us that what we thought was an impossible problem is solvable in principle.” The researchers said that by deploying the AI system in locations with effective seismic tracking networks such as California, Italy, Japan, Greece, Turkey, and Texas, it can be trained to increase its success rate and potentially improve its accuracy to within just tens of miles.
Alexandros Savvaidis, a senior research scientist who leads the bureau’s Texas Seismological Network Program, the state’s seismic network, said: “You don’t see earthquakes coming. It’s a matter of milliseconds, and the only thing you can control is how prepared you are. Even with 70%, that’s a huge result and could help minimize economic and human losses and has the potential to dramatically improve earthquake preparedness worldwide.” Editors' Recommendations Tom Hanks warns of AI-generated ad using his likeness Hollywood writers strike ends after agreement on AI and other issues Coca-Cola apparently used AI to create a soda ‘from the future’ Security robots could be coming to a school near you AI-powered commentary is coming to next month’s Wimbledon Artificial Intelligence LG Tech for Change Tech News The Food Fight News Amazon has started using artificial intelligence (AI) to generate summaries of reviews for some of its listings.

News CES is more than just a neon-drenched show-and-tell session for the world’s biggest tech manufacturers. More and more, it’s also a place where companies showcase innovations that could truly make the world a better place — and at CES 2023, this type of tech was on full display. We saw everything from accessibility-minded PS5 controllers to pedal-powered smart desks. But of all the amazing innovations on display this year, these three impressed us the most: Samsung's Relumino Mode Across the globe, roughly 300 million people suffer from moderate to severe vision loss, and generally speaking, most TVs don’t take that into account. So in an effort to make television more accessible and enjoyable for those millions of people suffering from impaired vision, Samsung is adding a new picture mode to many of its new TVs.
Computing Nvidia is looking to make work and development in artificial intelligence more accessible, giving researchers an easy way to access its DGX supercomputer. The company announced that it will launch a subscription service for its DGX Superpod as an affordable way to gain entry into the world of supercomputers.
The DGX SuperPod is capable of 100 petaflops of AI performance, according to the company, and when configured 20 DGX A100 systems, it's designed for large-scale AI projects.
