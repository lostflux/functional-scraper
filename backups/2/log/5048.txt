Why trust us? HP Spectre x360 13.5 vs. Apple MacBook Air M1 By Mark Coppock Close Apple’s MacBook Air M1 remains in the company’s lineup thanks to solid performance, excellent battery life, a quality build, and an attractive price for a premium laptop. But it faces some stiff competition, like the HP Spectre x360 13.5, that’s more expensive but also offers solid combinations of performance, battery life, and quality.
Specs Price and configurations Design Performance Display and audio Portability The Spectre x360 13.5 provides more flexibility, at a price Both machines are on our list of the best laptops , for good reason. And the question is, should you spend more on the Spectre x360 13.5 or save your money with the MacBook Air M1? Specs HP Spectre x360 13.5 Apple MacBook Air M1 Dimensions 11.73 inches by 8.68 inches by 0.67 inches 11.97 inches x 8.36 inches x 0.63 inches Weight 3.01 pounds 2.8 pounds Processor Intel Core i5-1235U Intel Core i7-1255U Apple M1 Graphics Intel Iris Xe Apple M1 RAM 8GB 16GB 32GB 8GB 16GB Display 13.5-inch 3:2 WXUGA+ (1920 x 1280) IPS touch 13.5-inch 3:2 WXUGA+ (1920 x 1280) IPS touch privacy screen 13.5-inch 3:2 3K2K (3000 x 2000) OLED touch 13.3-inch 16:10 (2,560 x 1600) 400 nits Storage 512GB SSD 1TB SSD 2TB SSD 256GB SSD 512GB SSD 1TB SSD 2TB SSD Touch Yes No Ports 2 x USB-C 4.0 with Thunderbolt 4 1 x USB-A 3.2 Gen 2 1 x 3.5mm audio jack 1 x microSD card reader 2 x USB-C 4.0 with Thunderbolt 4 1 x 3.5mm audio jack Wireless Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.2 Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.0 Webcam 5MP with infrared camera for facial recognition 720p FaceTime HD Operating system Windows 11 macOS Battery 66 watt-hour 49.9 watt-hour Price $1,250+ $999 Rating 4.5 out of 5 stars 4.5 out of 5 stars Price and configurations The MacBook Air M1 features an 8-core CPU/7-core GPU M1 processor across all configurations, and it starts at 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD for $1,000. It’s the least expensive MacBook you can buy. At the high end, the MacBook Air M1 costs $2,000 for 16GB of RAM and a 2TB SSD.
The Spectre x360 13.5 has a wide range of configurations available. The entry-level configuration is $1,250 for a Core i5-1235U CPU, 8GB of RAM , a 512GB SSD, and a WUXGA+ IPS touch display. The most you’ll spend is $1,885 for a Core i7-1255U, 32GB of RAM, a 2TB SSD, and a WUXGA+ privacy touch panel. We reviewed the Spectre with a Core i7-1255U, 16GB of RAM , a 1TB SSD, and a 3K2K OLED touch display, which costs $1,675. Overall, you can configure a more powerful system for less money than the high-end MacBook Air M1.
Design 1.
HP Spectre x360 13.5 2.
Apple MacBook Air M1 The MacBook Air M1 is a standard clamshell laptop, with the same tapered design as the original. The newer MacBook Air M2 shakes up the machine’s chassis in a big way, but there’s nothing wrong with the older version. It’s incredibly well-built, elegant and minimalist, and it’s thin and light enough for highly portable use. The MacBook’s hinge is smoother than the Spectre’s more complicated version and just as good at holding the display firmly in place.
The Spectre x360 13.5 is a very different machine. It’s a 360-degree convertible 2-in-1, meaning it morphs between clamshell, tent, media, and tablet modes. It’s just as good a clamshell as the MacBook, but it’s a lot more flexible. The touch display supports an active pen, making it a good platform for digital inking that’s aided by the taller 3:2 display. The Spectre is also solidly built and sports a more elaborate “gem-cut” aesthetic in Natural Silver, Nightfall Black, and Nocturne Blue color schemes.
While the Spectre x360 13.5’s keyboard is excellent, with deep, snappy switches providing precise feedback, the MacBook Air M1 uses Apple’s superior Magic Keyboard. It’s shallower but provides an even more precise feel that’s consistent and quiet across the entire keyboard. The MacBook’s Force Touch touchpad is also better than the Spectre’s mechanical version, which is great for a Windows laptop.
Connectivity favors the HP, which has as many Thunderbolt 4 ports as the Apple and adds in a USB-A port for legacy devices and a microSD card reader. The Spectre also has faster wireless connectivity with Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.2 compared to Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.0.
Finally, the Spectre x360 13.5 enjoys a 5MP webcam with infrared camera supporting Windows 11 Hello passwordless login via facial recognition, to go with a fingerprint reader along the bottom row of the keyboard. The MacBook Air M1 makes do with a 720p webcam and the equally reliable Touch ID power button.
Performance Image used with permission by copyright holder The Spectre x360 13.5 uses a 15-watt Intel 12th-gen Core i7-1255U, a 10-core/12-thread CPU that’s aimed directly at thin and light laptops.
 The MacBook Air M1 uses Apple’s first-generation ARM processor with eight CPU cores and seven GPU cores. It’s a chip that runs cool enough that the MacBook is fanless and completely silent, while the Spectre has fans to keep things cool.
When running in its performance mode, the Spectre x360 13.5 matches the MacBook Air M1 in CPU-intensive tasks, and both laptops can handle demanding productivity tasks. It’s likely that the MacBook will run GPU-intensive creative apps more quickly than the Spectre with its integrated Intel Iris Xe graphics, thanks to optimizations built into the M1 processor.
For most users, though, these are two equally matched laptops and can meet most portable performance needs. Neither will be a particularly good gaming laptop.
HP Spectre x360 13.5 (Core i7-1255U) Apple MacBook Air M1 (M1) Geekbench 5 (single / multi) Bal: 1,566 / 7,314 Perf: 1,593 / 7,921 Bal: 1,727 / 7,585 Perf: N/A Handbrake (seconds) Bal: 169 Perf: 120 Bal: 156 Perf: N/A Cinebench R23 (single / multi) Bal: 1,623 / 5,823 Perf: 1,691 / 7,832 Bal: 1,479 / 6,680 Perf: N/A Display and audio Mark Coppock/Digital Trends The MacBook Air M1 uses a 13.3-inch 16:10 Liquid Retina IPS display running at 2,560 x 1600, and it’s a good panel for productivity work. It’s plenty bright and has good contrast, but its colors aren’t quite wide enough for creators.
We reviewed the Spectre x360 13.5 with the optional 13.5-inch 3:2 3K2K (3,000 x 2,000) OLED display, and it’s spectacular. It’s sharper than the MacBook’s, and it’s just as bright. However, its colors are wide and incredibly accurate, and its contrast is deep providing inky blacks. HP also offers a WUXGA+ IPS and IPS privacy panels.
If you want the best performance in photo and video editing (display-wise, that is), along with excellent high dynamic range ( HDR ) quality, then the Spectre’s OLED panel wins out. Both are great for simple productivity work, though.

The MacBook Air M1 has two speakers that provide good sound as well, but the Spectre puts out more of it.
Portability Image used with permission by copyright holder The MacBook Air M1 is slightly thinner than the Spectre x360 13.5 and it weighs a bit less. But both machines are small and light enough that they’re easy to carry around.
The biggest difference in portability, at least when the Spectre x360 13.5 is equipped with its higher-res OLED display, is in battery life. The MacBook Air M1 benefits from the extreme efficiency of Apple’s ARM architecture, and it gets better battery life. The difference wouldn’t be quite so great with the Spectre running a lower-res IPS panel, but the MacBook would still likely last longer.

Performance is similar between the two machines, and the MacBook Air M1 enjoys a better keyboard and touchpad and superior battery life. The HP wins out in display quality and connectivity.
If you’re on a tight budget but want a premium laptop, the MacBook Air M1 is a great choice. But otherwise, the Spectre x360 13.5 deserves its higher price.
Editors' Recommendations MacBook Pro 14-inch vs. MacBook Pro 13-inch: Which one should you buy? Why it’s still a good time to buy an M2 MacBook Air The Surface Laptop Go 3 is no match for the MacBook Air This Acer OLED laptop (almost) beats the MacBook Air 15 — and it’s cheaper Dell XPS 13, Apple MacBook Air (M1) prices slashed for a limited time Apple Laptops Versus Computing We've been hearing rumors about Apple updating its MacBook range with the new M3 processor throughout this year, but those plans might be in jeopardy. According to Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple is ditching its plans to release M3-powered MacBooks this year.
Although that runs counter to some reports we heard earlier in the year -- one rumor said Apple would release its new MacBooks no later than September -- more reports are mounting that claim Apple is delaying its plans.
Computing We’re only about a couple weeks or so out from Apple’s September event, where the company will unveil its iPhone 15 and a slate of brand new Apple Watches. But if you’re holding out for a new MacBook Pro or MacBook Air, don’t get your hopes up -- these laptops, which are rumored to be outfitted with one of the most significant chip upgrades in years, aren’t expected to come until October.
According to Bloomberg reporter Mark Gurman’s latest Power On newsletter, the show will be the first time the public casts eyes on the iPhone 15 range, as well as the Apple Watch Series 9 (and potentially a second-generation Apple Watch Ultra). It’ll follow the now-established pattern of a prerecorded video followed by an in-person hands-on session.
Computing While the laptop industry continues to move toward 14-inch laptops and larger, the 13-inch laptop remains an important category. One of the best is the Apple MacBook Air M2, with an extremely thin and well-built chassis, great performance, and incredibly long battery life.
Lenovo has recently introduced the third generation of its ThinkPad X1 Nano, one of the lightest laptops we've tested and a good performer as well. It's stiff competition, but which of these two diminutive laptops stands apart?
