The automaker has reportedly received planning permission to construct an all-night diner and drive-in movie theater in Los Angeles, Teslarati reported recently.
The 1950s-style facility will also operate as an around-the-clock Tesla Supercharger station with 32 stalls. And while visitors wait for their vehicle to charge, they can grab a bite to eat as they clips from famous movies, or simply enjoy the view from the open rooftop.
Lucid joins other automakers by adopting Tesla charging plug Tesla’s Cybertruck finally gets a delivery date The fastest electric cars, ranked by 0-60 mph acceleration The idea for the unique Supercharger station was first mentioned by Tesla boss Elon Musk in April 2021 when he tweeted : “Major new Supercharger station coming to Santa Monica soon! Hoping to have [’50s] diner & 100 best movie clips playing too. Thanks Santa Monica city!” While Musk looks set to see his dream become a reality, the attraction will actually be built at 7001 W. Santa Monica Boulevard in West Hollywood rather than Santa Monica.
And he mentions “clips” rather than full-length features because Superchargers can add several hundred miles of range in just 15 minutes, so most customers won’t be hanging around that long.
Tesla put in an application for the project in November 2022 before receiving permission from the City of Los Angeles last month.
It’s not clear when construction of the Supercharger station will begin, or when it will be open for business, but now that the necessary permissions have been given, work on it could begin soon.
While unusual in its design, the West Hollywood site is part of broader plans by Tesla to build out its global network of Superchargers to allow Tesla and other EV owners easy access to fast-charging facilities. In the U.S., there are nearly 1,900 Tesla Supercharger stations with just over 20,000 ports, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.
If the location proves a hit with visitors, it could encourage Tesla to build more themed sites that offer much more than simply the chance to charge a car and grab a drink.
Editors' Recommendations Tesla says Cybertruck resellers could face harsh penalties Toyota joins ‘the Tesla plug’ club Volkswagen ID.4 vs Tesla Model Y Elon Musk teases Cybertruck ahead of imminent delivery event Tesla launches more affordable Model S and Model X, but there’s a catch Tech News Tesla Cars The first Cybertruck built at Tesla's Giga Texas facility. Tesla Tesla has shown off the first Cybertruck to roll off the production line at its new Gigafactory plant in Austin, Texas.
Cars First introduced in 2019, the Tesla Cybertruck is unlike any pickup we've ever seen. It's electric, which isn't entirely unusual, and frankly expected from Tesla, but its futuristic design makes it stand out from everything else on the road. Whether that's a good or a bad thing is a matter of personal preference, and keep in mind we haven't seen the final, production-bound version yet. Tesla often makes tweaks to its cars before production, however, we may not have to wait long -- as Tesla says the truck will finally start shipping later this year.
In the meantime, we're taking a look at what it is, what it does, how much it will cost, and when cyber motorists will have the opportunity to get behind the wheel. We're looking at its rivals, too, and the list grows on a regular basis.
Design Cars To date, electric vehicles have cost considerably more than their gasoline-powered counterparts, but that’s finally changing. Every year, more and more inexpensive EVs are hitting the market and, with the help of local, state, and federal tax credits and rebates (if available), many of them now sell for well below the 2023 median car price of $48,000.
If you're a budget-conscious buyer, that number is probably little consolation. However, there are a lot of good options for closer to $30,000 and below -- if you know where to look. That's why we've put together this guide. Here's a list of the nine most affordable electric vehicles available right now, ranked from cheapest to most expensive. Note that we're only including vehicles that are available in the U.S.
