Why trust us? How smart water management can protect against damage and save money By Simon Sage Close The world of smart home plumbing is still relatively small, but the benefits of hooking up your home’s pipes with sensors can save you loads on repairs by catching leaks early. Managing your water usage can be vital if you’re living in a drought-prone area, while smart water heating can save a few bucks on your monthly bills, too. Let’s take a look at some of the smart home water management system types available, and what they can do for you.
Smart leak sensors Smart water heaters Smart faucets Can you save energy with smart water management? Smart leak sensors Image used with permission by copyright holder Water leaks account for 10,000 gallons of lost water each year per home.
 About 10% of homes leak more than 90 gallons a day, adding up to a whopping one trillion gallons of leaked water nationwide each year. It’s a big problem, but highly fixable. For starters, it’s easy to get into smart leak sensors and use them in your home. There are a couple of ways these can work.
The most affordable sensors detect moisture on the ground. For some examples, check out our favorite smart leak detectors.
 These units are simple to set up, but really only send your phone a notification once things have gotten bad. The more advanced leak sensors will monitor water pressure at the source and determine leaks based on changes to that water pressure. This can provide an earlier warning of drips no matter where they’re happening. These systems often have a remote shutoff so you can use your phone to cut off a home’s water whenever it detects a leak. Not long ago, we took a close look at Moen’s Flo system which does exactly this kind of thing, and we walked away impressed. Phyn, made in coordination with Belkin, has a similar water leak system worth checking out.

It keeps tabs on how expensive power is at any given time, when you generally use your hot water, and then plans the heating accordingly. Smart thermostats operate on a similar basis, only for your home’s climate control. We’ve already looked at smart water heaters that can pre-emptively heat your tank when electrical rates are low.
Smart faucets Image used with permission by copyright holder If you’re going to be connecting your home’s plumbing to your phone, it makes sense to do so at the final output. Smart faucets boast a range of user-friendly functions, such as touchless control, flow rate adjustment, and disbursement monitoring. This means you can, for example, use Alexa to ask your faucet to pour out an exact measurement of water. If you’re interested in something like this for your kitchen or washroom, check out some of our favorite smart faucets or read our review of U by Moen to see what they’re like in action.
Can you save energy with smart water management? Your biggest potential savings in Wi-Fi-connected plumbing is with your water heater. Hot water eats up about 20% of a household’s energy demands.
 A Uniform Energy Factor rating is used to determine exactly how efficient a water heater is at using power. That rating along with additional testing is used to provide the tank with an Energy Star certification for efficiency. This designation is typically given to products proven to save a minimum of 10% on energy bills compared to standard products. Energy Star criteria for water heaters vary depending on tank size and whether they’re electric or gas-fired. Though the EPA is still testing smart water heaters for their benefits , their ability to help you control energy usage will do the most work with inefficient water heaters that have a lot of room to make up. If you have a water heater that isn’t Energy Star certified, consider adding a smart water management upgrade to make up the difference.
As water supply grows more scarce in some areas, you may see your utilities offering incentives to install these flow management systems. Be sure to look at this useful state-by-state breakdown of rebates available for water efficiency measures to see what’s available in your area.

According to a lot of studies, roughly half of all Americans feel sleepy during the day -- a firm indicator that their nightly sleep isn't quite as restorative as it should be. Whether it be stress (due to high electric bills, maybe?) or just a lack of comfort, poor sleep quality is nearing alarming levels.
Temperature plays a large role in that. In fact, reaching a proper room temperature is one of the most important factors for achieving high-quality, restful sleep. According to SleepFoundation.org, the ideal temperature for the bedroom is around 65 degrees.
Smart Home Did you know you may have a huge battery in your basement or utility closet? I didn't. It's been hiding in plain sight there for years, and Power X wants to unlock its potential for you. I sat down to speak with Power X CEO Manuel Schoenfield who told me about it -- and it's an interesting idea.
Power X is a New York-based startup that wants to use smart sensors and artificial intelligence (A.I.) I to fix the way power is used today. We've talked before about smart home devices that can help you monitor your power usage. I looked at Sense about a year ago (almost to the day) and have since found it helpful at figuring out where my power was going. Power X will do something similar, but bigger in a few different ways.
Smart Home Springtime brings with it fresh life, blooming flowers, and in some parts of the country, incredible storms. The old expression that March comes in like a lion and goes out like a lamb holds particularly true in the Southeast and Midwest, where spring storms are accompanied by damaging, dangerous tornadoes.
Meteorological science has advanced in amazing ways. People now have a much better idea when dangerous weather is on the way, but only if they pay attention -- and even then, it can sometimes be hard to hear the alert if there's a lot going on in the home.
