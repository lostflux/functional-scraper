From Alien and Back to the Future to Dune and Blade Runner, sci-fi films continue to improve thanks to new technology. Many sci-fi films find a home on Netflix and wind up on the streamer's 10 most popular movies list. Films like Don't Look Up, The Adam Project, and Bird Box are 10 of the most popular English films on Netflix ever.
The Adam Project is one of our picks for sci-fi movies to watch in November. Other selections include the epic sequel to Godzilla: King of the Monsters, and a sci-fi thriller about a pilot's fight for survival against the dinosaurs.
Godzilla vs. Kong (2021) Entertainment Sin City hosts Sunday Night Football as the Las Vegas Raiders (4-5) welcome the New York Jets (4-4) to Allegiant Stadium in Week 10. The game will start at 8:20 p.m. ET/5:20 p.m. PT on November 12. Mike Tirico, Cris Collinsworth, and Melissa Stark are on the call for NBC, and the game will also stream on Peacock.
Despite their mediocre records, the Jets and Raiders are hunting for a Wild Card spot in the AFC. The Jets must improve their offense if they want any shot at the postseason. The Jets have a league-worst eight offensive touchdowns on the season. For Las Vegas, the Raiders fired head coach Josh McDaniels before Week 9 and promoted Antonio Pierce to interim coach. The Raiders responded by beating the Giants 30-6.
Entertainment College football doesn't get much better than a night game at Autzen Stadium in Eugene, Oregon. The No. 6 Oregon Ducks (8-1) will host the USC Trojans (7-3) in a Pac-12 rivalry game on Saturday night. The opening kickoff is scheduled for 10:30 p.m. ET/7:30 p.m. PT on November 11. Tim Brando, Spencer Tillman, and Josh Sims will call the game on Fox.
USC and Oregon are two teams heading in different directions. USC has lost three of their last four games and will likely not qualify for the Pac-12 Championship in Las Vegas. Meanwhile, Oregon remains one of the best teams in the country, with their only blemish coming on the road in a three-point loss to Washington. If Oregon wins out, they will likely have their rematch with Washington in the conference championship.
