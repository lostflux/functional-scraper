Shows from different countries outside of North America are making waves, and this includes British TV shows. While these are still in the English language, they have a different look, feel, and tone that makes them exciting.
Of course, there are also U.K.-set shows that aren’t necessarily British, like Bridgerton and its spinoff Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story but the shows are actually American productions. Nonetheless, Netflix has a wide selection of series that feature British actors, are set in places like London, and come right from England. We have rounded up the best ones you’ll find, from top shows everyone is talking about to hidden gems.
Looking for something other than Britain’s best? We’ve also put together guides to the best movies on Netflix and the best shows on Netflix , as well as a recap of what’s new on Netflix.
The Crown tv-ma 2016 Top Boy tv-ma 2011 Who Is Erin Carter? tv-ma 2023 White Gold 2017 The Crown (2016) new tv-ma 6 Seasons Drama Claire Foy, Matt Smith, Vanessa Kirby Peter Morgan watch on Netflix watch on Netflix The Crown finally comes to an end in its sixth and final season that focuses on the era of Prince Charles (Dominic West) and Princess Diana (Elizabeth Debicki). Delivered in two parts, the final season will explore the years between 1997 and 2005. This involves pivotal moments like Tony Blair as Prime Minister, Prince William’s early relationship with Kate Middleton, Prince Charles’ wedding to Camilla Parker Bowles, and, most notably, the tragic death of Princess Diana.
Imelda Staunton reprises her role as Queen Elizabeth II while the sprawling cast will include newcomers including Ed McVey as Prince William during his college years and Meg Bellamy as Kate Middleton.
Read less The 50 best movies on Netflix right now (November 2023) The best Hulu original series right now The 50 best anime on Hulu right now Top Boy (2011) new tv-ma 5 Seasons Drama Ashley Walters, Kane Robinson, Micheal Ward Ronan Bennett watch on Netflix watch on Netflix With five seasons to date, three produced by Netflix, the British crime drama Top Boy is set in a fictional Summerhouse estate in London where a young and troubled man gets involved in the criminal underworld involving drugs, murder, and an intense struggle for power and money. With British rapper and songwriter Ashley Walters (Asher D) heading up the cast, Letitia Wright ( Black Mirror , Black Panther ) among the recurring characters, and Drake an executive producer, it unsurprisingly has a 95% score on Rotten Tomatoes.
Be warned — Netflix has made it a little complicated to watch Top Boy in its entirety. The first two seasons stream on Netflix under the title Top Boy: Summerhouse (linked below), while the latest seasons are found separately as just “Top Boy”.
Read less Who Is Erin Carter? (2023) new tv-ma 1 Season Action & Adventure, Crime, Drama Evin Ahmad, Sean Teale, Douglas Henshall Jack Lothian watch on Netflix watch on Netflix Set in Barcelona, Spain, the British born title character, played by Erin Ahmad, is a schoolteacher whose life is turned upside down when she kills an assailant during an armed robbery at a grocery store. While she did what needed to be done, people can’t help but wonder how she acquired such skilled fighting abilities. Who is she really and what happened in her past? Who is Erin Carter? is a thriller that garnered decent reviews, with Ahmad, known in North America for her lead role in the Netflix original Snabba Cash , praised for her tackling of the intense action role. Dubbed an “addictive, old-school action drama,” Who is Erin Carter? is a quick seven-episode watch.
Read less White Gold (2017) new 2 Seasons Comedy Lee Ross, Ed Westwick, James Buckley Damon Beesley watch on Netflix watch on Netflix Quietly flying under the radar, White Gold had two seasons, released two years apart. The British sitcom stars Ed Westwick as Vincent Swan, a slimy double-glazed windows salesman who rips people off and engages in questionable sales tactics to meet quotas. Meanwhile, he’s less than stellar to his wife and kids.
Obsessed with wealth and status, his two friends and co-workers are Inbetweeners ’ James Buckley and Joe Thomas as Brian and Martin. While Brian is just as underhanded as Vincent, Martin struggles with his moral compass and cheats customers out of their hard-earned money to do shoddy work with second-rate products. The mid-1980s Corringham, Essex setting and the characters you love to hate make White Gold a worthy watch.
Read less Heartstopper (2022) tv-14 2 Seasons Drama Joe Locke, Kit Connor, William Gao Alice Oseman watch on Netflix watch on Netflix A British coming-of-age romantic comedy-drama, Heartstopper pulled on viewers’ heartstrings when it premiered in 2022. The series, which is based on the Alice Oseman webcomic and graphic novel of the same name, follows Charlie (Joe Locke), who falls in love with his classmate, Nick (Kit Connor). While Joe has been recently outed, Kit is a rough-and-tumble rugby player who hasn’t quite figured out his sexuality.
The show has been praised for its portrayal of members of the LGBTQ+ community, maintaining a perfect Rotten Tomatoes score for its inaugural season. Critics praise the show’s sensitivity and charm, as well as its depiction of both sides of the coin: a young man who is open and confident in his sexuality and another who is still trying to understand his feelings, but is also accepting of them.
Read less Sex Education (2019) tv-ma 4 Seasons Comedy, Drama Emma Mackey, Asa Butterfield, Gillian Anderson, Ncuti Gatwa, Connor Swindells Laurie Nunn watch on Netflix watch on Netflix Launched in January 2019, the British drama Sex Education has been called heartfelt and surprisingly wise. It stars Asa Butterfield as a socially awkward teenager who is ambivalent about sex, largely due to his mother (Gillian Anderson) being a sex therapist.
Netflix reports that Sex Education had more than 40 million viewers after it launched on the site. The series concludes with its fourth and final season.
Read less Black Mirror (2011) tv-ma 6 Seasons Sci-fi, Psychological Thriller, Dystopia Daniel Kaluuya, Wyatt Russell, Bryce Dallas Howard, Daniel Lapaine Charlie Brooker watch on Netflix watch on Netflix While Black Mirror eventually morphed into a “Netflix original,” Charlie Brooker’s brilliant dystopian series first premiered on Channel 4 in the U.K. Most episodes look at dire, worst-case scenarios regarding our relationship with technology and modern reliance on it.
With six seasons to date, this isn’t the type of show you’ll be able to binge-watch quickly. But you can watch in any order and are guaranteed to see your jaw drop by the end of each episode.
 It’s compelling, thought-provoking television.
Read less Treason (2022) tv-ma 1 Season Drama, Action & Adventure Charlie Cox, Olga Kurylenko, Oona Chaplin Matt Charman watch on Netflix watch on Netflix In this spy miniseries, Sir Martin Angelis (Ciaran Hinds) is the former chief of MI6, who is hospitalized following a poisoning. His deputy chief, Adam ( Daredevil ‘s Charlie Cox), takes over. When Adam deciphers a secret code and meets with a former lover and ex-SVR operative, Kara (Olga Kurylenko), he discovers a sinister plot to help catapult him to the top position in the government organization.
Adam has a difficult decision to make: continue aiding Kara in her mission, risking his now already compromised career in the process, or refuse to help. But Kara isn’t going to take no for an answer, and when Adam realizes his family is in danger too, he has no choice but to play ball.
Treason is a thrilling ride through five episodes and a great one to watch for any fan of the espionage genre.
Read less Man vs. Bee (2022) 1 Season Comedy, Family Rowan Atkinson, Jing Lusi, Julian Rhind-Tutt Rowan Atkinson, Will Davies watch on Netflix watch on Netflix If you’re in the mood for a good laugh and you’re a fan of Rowan Atkinson, check out his latest, Man vs. Bee , a British comedy he also co-wrote. He stars as Trevor Bingley, a down-on-his-lock man who is house-sitting a mansion when he meets his worst enemy: a bee. The plot sounds ridiculous, but it’s filled with plenty of hijinks and slapstick humor.
You’ll get the same humor you’d expect from the iconic actor who has become synonymous with his most popular character, Mr. Bean. The physical comedy, contorted facial expressions, and general hilarity will bring a sense of familiarity to existing fans and introduce new ones to Atkinson’s unique form of comedy.
