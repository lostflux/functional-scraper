By Jon Bitner Close While video doorbells from Ring, Arlo, and Nest are great additions to any smart home, they’re not without their quirks. Depending on your model, you might have to deal with frequent battery changes, incompatible chimes, or motion settings that constantly need to be adjusted. Most of those are easy to live with (or can be modified to your preference), but one thing that’s out of your control is the weather. And, like most electronics, video doorbells have some strict limits on what they can endure.
Video doorbells can withstand high temperatures (but they’re not invincible) How to keep your video doorbell cool If you live in a location with scorching summers, here’s what you need to know about how video doorbells work in extreme heat.
Video doorbells can withstand high temperatures (but they’re not invincible) Ring Temperatures in the vast majority of the world fall well within the operating range of video doorbells. The exact specs vary by product, but you typically won’t start seeing issues with your video doorbells until the temperature creeps up beyond 110 degrees Fahrenheit.
The best smart home devices for 2023 Arlo Video Doorbell 2nd Gen vs. Ring Video Doorbell Pro 2 Arlo Essential 2nd Gen vs. Arlo Pro 4: is the Arlo Pro 4 worth it? For example, Ring says its video doorbells can operate in 113-degree weather, but “prolonged exposure” isn’t recommended. If used at these temperatures for too long, the doorbell might randomly shut down in an attempt to cool off.
If your Ring video doorbell is out in 120-degree weather, it will shut down immediately. And if you keep your Ring device in 105-degree heat for more than a few days, it might also shut down to try and beat the heat.
It’s a similar story for most Nest devices (which were designed to operate up to 104 degrees) and Arlo devices (which were designed to handle up to 113 degrees). Going beyond these limits will cause the device to turn off.
How to keep your video doorbell cool Google Most households shouldn’t have a problem keeping their video doorbells below these extreme thresholds. However, if you live in locations such as Las Vegas, Phoenix, or Austin, you might want to take a few extra steps to keep your front door cool. Here are a couple of tips to help: Keep your video doorbell in the shade. If you have an awning over your front door, this should be fairly easy. If you don’t, consider installing a small shade above it or hanging a plant that creates shade during the hottest parts of the day.
Installing your video doorbell in a well-ventilated area helps lower the internal temperature. In other words, don’t place it inside a protective cover or case, which will only make the device warmer.
Check the weather. If you know it’s going to be a day with extreme heat, consider bringing your video doorbell inside. You can then remove its batteries to help cool it down faster, then replace the entire unit once temperatures are back to acceptable levels.

Arlo enhances home security offerings with new Arlo Total Security plans The best video doorbells for 2023 The best outdoor security cameras of 2023 Arlo Essential XL 2nd Gen vs. Arlo Pro 4: Which is the better security camera? Home Security Video Doorbells Smart Home Smart displays sit at the very center of most smart homes. With the ability to sync with other gadgets to issue commands, give you daily updates, or serve as a second screen to binge your favorite shows, smart displays are remarkably versatile devices.
The smart display market is more saturated today than ever before, with products from Amazon, Google, Facebook, and more vying for your attention. Google has even revealed that the upcoming Pixel Tablet will double as a smart display, and Apple might be throwing its hat into the ring sooner than expected.
Smart Home Wyze is a popular destination for smart home shoppers seeking premium features on a budget, and the new Wyze Video Doorbell v2 might be its most enticing product yet. Not only does it capture 2K footage and offer free 12-second video recording, but it also features a microSD card slot for local storage -- all for just $40.
That's an impressive list considering its low price. The microSD card slot is the big selling point, as few products in this price range offer the coveted feature. Having a video doorbell with an onboard microSD slot means you can record continuous footage both day and night. When the sun goes down, it also offers color night vision for improved clarity.
Smart Home While your traditional HVAC system can filter out dust, pollen, and other airborne particulates, sometimes it simply isn’t enough to keep your air as clean as you’d like. That’s where air purifiers come into play, as these secondary devices can be placed anywhere around your home to provide additional cleaning power.
They can also be incredibly helpful during the cold winter months when windows and doors stay closed -- preventing you from airing out all the allergens floating around your home.
