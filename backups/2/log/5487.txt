That was the case recently with the popular password manager 1Password, which recently disclosed (via Bleeping Computer ) that its Okta support system was breached by malicious hackers.
Fortunately, it doesn’t appear that any customer data was stolen, so if you use 1Password, your login info should be safe for now. However, it’s always good to regularly update your passwords (or use passkeys ) just in case they fall into the wrong hands.
Andrew Brookes / Getty Images In a blog post on its website , 1Password explained the situation. “We detected suspicious activity on our Okta instance related to their Support System incident,” 1Password said. “After a thorough investigation, we concluded that no 1Password user data was accessed.” After detecting suspicious activity on September 29, 1Password “immediately terminated the activity, investigated, and found no compromise of user data or other sensitive systems, either employee-facing or user-facing.” This massive exploit lets hackers breach apps like Chrome, 1Password, and Telegram Hackers may have stolen the master key to another password manager This Bing flaw let hackers change search results and steal your files The Okta connection 1Password / AgileBits The link with Okta is interesting because it reveals a key vulnerability. Okta helps companies manage their users and ensure everyone can log in securely, and it also offers support for this process. As part of that, customers sometimes upload file archives to help diagnose problems, but these archives can contain sensitive data like session tokens and login data.
According to a detailed report from 1Password , a hacker stole a session cookie from a 1Password IT employee, then attempted to access the worker’s dashboard and request a list of admin users. Fortunately, the former action was blocked by Okta, while the second led to an automated email being sent to other 1Password admins, which alerted them to the breach.
While your login info is safe — no user data appears to have been accessed by the hacker — it shows just how easily seemingly secure systems can be breached by bad actors. In response to the incident, 1Password says it has reduced the number of “super admin” users, implemented tighter login rules for admins, and taken other measures.
Despite this episode, you should still pick one of the best password managers to keep your login data safe. After all, using an app to create and store unique passwords for you is far safer than using the same easily guessable login info for every account.
Editors' Recommendations Hackers are using this incredibly sneaky trick to hide malware Hacker sent to jail for huge 2020 Twitter breach No, 1Password wasn’t hacked – here’s what really happened If you use this free password manager, your passwords might be at risk LastPass reveals how it got hacked — and it’s not good news Software Tech News Computing It’s been a bad few months for password managers -- albeit mostly just for LastPass. But after the revelations that LastPass had suffered a major breach, attention is now turning to open-source manager KeePass.
Accusations have been flying that a new vulnerability allows hackers to surreptitiously steal a user’s entire password database in unencrypted plaintext. That’s an incredibly serious claim, but KeePass’s developers are disputing it.
Computing The cybersecurity breach that LastPass owner GoTo reported in November 2022 keeps getting worse as new details are revealed, calling into question the company's transparency on this serious issue.
It has been two months since GoTo shared the alarming news that hackers stole the usernames, passwords, email addresses, phone numbers, IP addresses, and even billing information of LastPass users. In GoTo's latest blog update, the company reported that several of its other products were compromised as well.
Computing The developers behind password management software LastPass have just shared some concerning news: Bad actors were recently able to access “elements of our customers’ information” in a recent security breach.
It’s the second time in just a couple of months that LastPass has suffered a security incident, and it appears the two events are directly linked. That’s because LastPass’s developers say that the unauthorized party was able to access customer data “using information obtained in the August 2022 incident.” Upgrade your lifestyle Digital Trends helps readers keep tabs on the fast-paced world of tech with all the latest news, fun product reviews, insightful editorials, and one-of-a-kind sneak peeks.
