Those are definitely strong brands, but one of the biggest draws for Disney+ is Disney itself. Next year marks the 100th anniversary of Walt Disney Studios, and the House of Mouse has come a long way in the last century. Disney was the first studio to produce a feature-length animated movie, a tradition that continues to this day. Additionally, Disney has released hundreds of live-action flicks, in addition to branching out into documentaries. Pixar is also at the forefront of Disney, with some of the most dazzling and innovative animated flicks to date. Taken all together, Disney is truly something special. And we celebrate that legacy each month by rounding up the best Disney movies on Disney+.
Editor’s note: With Disney owning so many different properties these days, we’ve excluded newer acquisitions like the Star Wars and Marvel franchises.

Johnny Depp gives a charismatic (and Oscar-nominated!) performance as Captain Jack Sparrow, an eccentric pirate who is out for revenge on his former crew for betraying him. When Jack’s rival, Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), kidnaps Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) to free himself from a curse, Jack joins forces with a young blacksmith named Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) to save Elizabeth and reclaim his ship, the Black Pearl.
