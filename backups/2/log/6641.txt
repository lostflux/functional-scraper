Why trust us? Hisense just debuted the world’s largest mini-LED TV at 100 inches By Simon Cohen Close Hisense Hisense now makes the world’s largest mini-LED backlit 4K TV: the 100-inch U8K TV. It announced the new TV at CEDIA Expo, the annual conference for AV professionals and installers, taking place in Denver, CO from September 7-9. The new TV might be the world’s biggest, but its price is surprisingly accessible (at least, for a TV of this size) at $10,000. Hisense’s TVs are often deeply discounted , sometimes as soon as they go on sale, so we expect this price to drop soon. It will be available from retailers like Best Buy and Amazon later this fall.
“Popularity and consumer interest in big screens continues to grow,” said David Gold, President of Hisense USA, in a press release. “While our laser TV lineup can reach up to an impressive 300-inches, we also wanted to offer an option that showcases Hisense’s superior mini-LED experience, and there was no better choice than what’s proving to be our most award-winning TV to date: the U8K Series. We’re the only brand offering mini-LED at the 100-inch size, at this performance level, with this feature set, and a value package.” The new 100-inch U8K is essentially a larger version of the Hisense 65U8K TV Digital Trends reviewed earlier in 2023, which earned high marks for its brightness, color, contrast, and gaming chops. The 100-inch version has all of the same great features, including IMAX Enhanced, Dolby Vision , a quantum dot-enhanced mini-LED backlight, 144Hz variable refresh rate (VRR), AMD FreeSync Premium, auto low-latency mode (ALLM) and Dolby Vision Gaming.
Sony Bravia X95L mini-LED vs. TCL QM8 QLED: The best LCD TV and the one you should buy Mini-LED vs. QLED TV: how one technology is improving the other TCL’s latest 98-inch 4K TV comes in at a great price The Google TV-powered smart TV is also compatible with ATSC 3.0 (NextGenTV) and boasts a 2.1.2-channel built-in speaker system with support for Dolby Atmos.
 For those who want to create a fully wireless sound system without the need for an AV receiver or a soundbar, WiSA SoundSend support is also included.
The race to produce the biggest TVs is clearly entering a new phase. Samsung just announced its largest mini-LED 8K resolution TV — the 98-inch QN990C — at the staggering price of $40,000, while at the other end of the spectrum, TCL’s new 98-inch S Class S5 LED 4K TV was just announced at $5,000.
Editors' Recommendations Hisense teases 110-inch, 10,000-nit TV ahead of CES 2024 What is mini-LED TV? How smaller, brighter LEDs can deliver better TV picture quality Samsung scales its Terrace outdoor TV to 85 inches with mini-LEDs Hisense kicks off its U8K mini-LED TV availability with deep discounts Hisense’s mini-LED U6K TV arrives, starting at $500 Hisense Tech News TV Audio / Video In May, TCL stunned us with the price of its new Q Class QM8 98-inch TV. At a mere $10,000, it was far less than the cheapest comparable model from Samsung. Today, Samsung is answering that challenge with an impressively low-priced 98-inch model of its own: the , which will be available starting in July for $8,000.
Audio / Video If you had told me 20 years ago — or, heck, even 15 — that Samsung and LG were going to be the top TV brands in the U.S., I’d have laughed in your face. But I feel like I’ve learned to see the writing on the wall since then. And now I’m wondering: Are TCL and Hisense the next Samsung and LG? If we take a look at TCL and Hisense's 2023 TV lineups, their recently inked partnerships with huge national sports organizations, and their progress over the last five years in terms of both technological advancement and sales, I think there's a strong argument in favor of TCL and Hisense becoming the top two TV brands in the U.S.
TCL in 2023 We’ll start with TCL’s 2023 TV lineup. You already know about the QM8 Mini-LED, right? If not, you have got to check out that TV. But what else does TCL have in store? Well, there’s the Q7, which, while not a mini-LED TV, does have a full-array local dimming backlight system, quantum dots, high brightness with 1,000 nits peak, and a slate of other desirable features. Plus, the 65-inch model, for price reference, is $1,000. Now, in case you don’t recall, last year’s 6-Series, the R655, was a mini-LED TV, and the 65-inch version of that TV sold for $1,000.
Audio / Video I don’t think you’re ready for the TCL QM8 TV. I sure wasn’t. And we need to talk about it.
Many of us were expecting good things from the TCL QM8. Based on some of the DMs, emails, and comments I’ve received, there’s a lot of interest in this TV. And I think that’s because what came out of CES looked really encouraging. But TCL is also changing its model numbers convention and kind of restructuring its TV lineup a bit, which might have had us wondering if the QM8 would be all that and a bag of chips, or possibly just another iteration on what used to be known as the 6-Series.
