The electric, cabless truck is now undertaking full-time operations at the site, transporting finished products between GE Appliances’ manufacturing facility and its Selmer warehouse, Monday through Thursday.
The driverless, zero-emissions vehicle is conducting as many as seven shuttles a day along the 0.3-mile (0.48-kilometer) private road, Sweden-based Einride said on Monday.
Big driverless buses are now serving passengers in Scotland Drivers needed (sort of): Einride wants remote pilots for its driverless pods Volvo has created an autonomous truck that looks like a sports car GE Appliances was able to operate the unusual-looking truck on a full-time basis following a number of successful pilots, first in a gated environment at the company’s Appliance Park headquarters two years ago, and then on a public road in the U.S. last year.
The deployment is part of a broader initiative aimed at creating what GE Appliances describes as “an automated logistics flow” designed to improve employee ergonomics and safety around the loading docks while also increasing work efficiency.
The system involves other technology such as AI cameras that trigger the raising and lowering of the dock doors, and the Slip robot that loads and unloads the vehicle — a process that GE Appliances says reduces loading times by as much as 80%.
Last year, Einride shared a video showing the accuracy of its autonomous driving technology: GE Appliances executive Harry Chase that using Einride’s autonomous vehicle technology is helping it to reduce emissions while allowing its workers to focus on more meaningful tasks. It also reduces challenging ergonomic tasks “like climbing on and off a forklift and hooking and unhooking trailers,” Chase said, adding: “We believe robotics and automation technology should work with and for people to improve their jobs.” Henrik Green, general manager of autonomous technologies at Einride, said his company was “very proud” to partner with GE Appliance and “be able to lead the industry in providing autonomous technology.” Einride showed off its first autonomous truck design in 2017 before developing subsequent versions that led to the current design.
Editors' Recommendations Cruise woes prompt production halt of fully driverless van GMC poured all of its truck-making expertise into the Sierra EV pickup Nissan’s high-tech ice cream truck removes the fumes from your order Tech News Cars Automakers are quick to say that electric cars are the future, but most aren’t acting that way. In an effort to convince customers to overlook teething problems with charging infrastructure, amortize major investments in battery manufacturing as quickly as possible, and maybe replicate a bit of that Tesla magic, automakers have been emphasizing performance and tech gimmicks instead of what really matters: building cars people can afford. Change is coming, though, and from an unexpected source.
Volvo is known for safety and sensible Swedish design, not value. But the 2025 Volvo EX30 undercuts EVs from mainstream brands like Hyundai, Kia, and Volkswagen in price without compromising range, features, or style. Pricing starts at just $36,245 for the base Single Motor Extended Range Core model, and even the maxed-out price of $47,895 for a Twin Motor Performance Ultra looks inexpensive compared to the stratospheric heights some EV prices can reach when all option boxes are checked.
Cars Lucid Motors has become the latest automaker to announce that it will adopt the North American Charging Standard (NACS) – also known as "the Tesla plug" – for its electric vehicles.
The move follows in the footsteps of more than a dozen other automakers that have also adopted Tesla’s charging connector, among them General Motors, Ford, Toyota, BMW, Jaguar Land Rover, Volvo, and Honda.
Cars General Motors-owned Cruise has halted production of its fully driverless vehicle -- the Origin -- just over a week after it suspended robotaxi operations nationwide following a number of troubling incidents involving its cars.
The news was announced by Cruise CEO Kyle Vogt during a meeting with staff on Monday, according to Forbes, which obtained audio of the gathering.
