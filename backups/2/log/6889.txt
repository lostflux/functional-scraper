You’re not alone today By Phil Nickinson Close Phil Nickinson / Digital Trends We’ve got bad news for anyone who relies on YouTube and YouTube TV for their NFL games — there’s some definite lag happening today. It’s so bad and so apparent that there’s a message atop the YouTube TV help pages.
The message reads: “If you’re experiencing buffering issues on YouTube, our team is aware and working on a fix.
YouTube TV or NFL Sunday Ticket may also be impacted.” On the end user side of things, you might see excessive loading times. We’re also seeing decreased resolution and/or frame rate. Sometimes it’s one or the other. Sometimes it’s both. (We’ve also been unable to watch YouTube TV on a Nest Hub Max, for what that’s worth.) YouTube TV still leads after latest round of streaming numbers YouTube TV is still growing on the back of NFL Sunday Ticket Multiview almost fixes one of the biggest problems with YouTube TV Having your NFL games lagging is never a good thing, but it’s particularly bad with YouTube TV being the biggest live-streaming service in the U.S. with more than 5 million subscribers at last count — and Google says it’s still growing , thanks to NFL Sunday Ticket having made the move to YouTube TV and YouTube proper.
And maybe making things even worse is that there’s not a darn thing any of us can do but wait.
So at this point, you’ve got a couple options. One is to shift over to an over-the-air antenna, which theoretically shouldn’t be affected (unless the problem is with the source broadcasts). Or you could switch to a YouTube TV alternative for a bit and hope it has a free trial to get you through the weekend.
Or you could just head out to your friendly neighborhood sports bar, a friend’s house, or just go outside and enjoy the sunshine.
Editors' Recommendations YouTube’s enhanced 1080p video now available on more devices YouTube NFL outage: Should Google give refunds or credits? YouTube rolling out some three-dozen new features this fall NFL Sunday Ticket in 2023: Everything you need to know YouTube TV in 4K: Everything you need to know Cord Cutting 101 Streaming Services Tech News YouTube Audio / Video In a slightly surprising and somewhat quiet shift, YouTube and YouTube TV are offering up a free seven-day trial of NFL Sunday Ticket. That is, you can watch any and all games (barring local blackouts) on a given Sunday, and then cancel if you want. Or keep NFL Sunday Ticket and watch all the games on all the Sundays.
The details were unceremoniously dropped on a YouTube/YouTube TV support page. The free trials should be available now, but the page does note that "if you don't see the 7-day trial at checkout, try again soon." Audio / Video It's tough to hit a YouTube property lately without running into a giant banner for NFL Sunday Ticket. And for good reason — the only (legal) service that lets you watch all the Sunday NFL games has moved from DirecTV to YouTube and YouTube TV. And that means that NFL Sunday Ticket is available to a lot more people. Like, all of them.
That's a good thing. The ability to watch what you want on whatever hardware you have is important. But there's a funny little fluke when it comes to how you buy NFL Sunday Ticket. Depending on the platform you're on, you might not actually be able to purchase NFL Sunday Ticket. At least not without taking a few extra steps.
Audio / Video You had to know that NFL Sunday Ticket on YouTube would at some point intersect with some of the biggest stars on YouTube, right? To that end, you can start looking for QR codes on select videos on the MrBeast channel — as well as on the NFL YouTube channel. There are 1,000 codes buried in old videos, and if you're the first to scan one, you'll get a free subscription to NFL Sunday Ticket this season (hat's worth about $450 retail).
So you'll want to be quick about it.
