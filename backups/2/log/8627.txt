Urikar just released their brand-new percussion gun, the Pro 3. This massage gun uses a high-torque brushless motor equipped with its QuietPower™ 2.0 technology, which quietly delivers up to 45 lbs. of no-install force at up 3400 rpm and stimulates muscle groups to a depth of 14mm. It quickly relieves muscle tension, promotes circulation, greatly accelerates muscle recovery, and brings deep-level comfort.
The most important feature that sets Urikar Pro 3 apart from competitors? It’s the 30 different speed levels ranging from 1800-3400 rpm. Whether it’s for muscle relaxation after exercise, or just a gentle daily massage, you’ll find the right speed for you.
A revealing new video shows the impact that each of the different speed levels of Pro 3 has on a bottle of Coca-Cola; the higher the speed used, the greater amplitude formed, and the smaller the bubbles generated. This is a good visual of how powerful the massage gun is and the differences between each speed. Speeds 1-6 focus on muscle activation, speeds 7-12 are mainly for muscle relaxation, and if you want a post-workout relax select speeds 13-18. Fitness enthusiasts might want to select the professional levels of speeds 19-24, and speeds 25-30 are just right for the professional athlete.
As the perfect complement to the different speeds, the Urikar Pro 3 massage gun comes with 6 interchangeable massage heads to target all muscle groups. Pro 3 helps you to relax muscle tissues across the whole body in a way that’s comfortable and effortless.

While you’re there, check out the other high-quality massage guns from Urikar, too, like the Pro 2 — for people who want a heated massage gun. Using the 3+1 smart modes that let you choose between constant speed, intermittent, ladder, and heating modes. You’ll also find the 180° rotating arm, eight separate attachments, and a 65W brushless motor.
