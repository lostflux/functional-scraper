First reported by Reuters, the move is surprising given the popularity of Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, which allow users to project content from smartphones onto a car’s touchscreen, bypassing the native infotainment systems.
GM’s decision to stop offering these systems on future EVs, starting with the 2024 Chevrolet Blazer EV, could help the automaker capture more customer data, Reuters noted, providing insight into how vehicles are used. But it will likely be detrimental to the user experience, as customers will have to learn to use built-in infotainment systems, rather than the smartphone interfaces they’re used to.
It will be a bigger loss for Apple users, however, as there doesn’t appear to be a direct replacement for CarPlay. The decision to use Google-developed infotainment systems means features familiar to Android users will continue in future GM vehicles. Those vehicles will include access to Google Maps and Google Assistant at no extra cost for eight years, GM representatives told Reuters, implying that fees may apply after that. Spotify and Audible apps will also be included.
GM has been working with Google on software development since 2019, debuting Google built-in features on the GMC Hummer EV , which started production in 2022.
Volvo and sibling brand Polestar already offer Android-based infotainment systems with apps like Google Maps and Google Assistant built in, but haven’t announced plans to drop Apple CarPlay.
GM plans to continue offering Apple CarPlay and Android Auto on its combustion models, and owners of existing vehicles will continue to be able to use these features.
Ars Technica reports that a handful of current GM EVs will also continue to offer Apple CarPlay and Android Auto through at least the 2024 model year, including the Cadillac Lyriq , GMC Hummer EV pickup and SUV, Chevrolet Silverado EV , and Chevy Bolt EV and EUV.
GM has said it will eliminate tailpipes from all light-duty vehicles by 2035 and plans to make the Cadillac and Buick brands all-electric by the end of the decade. So the number of vehicles available with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto will gradually dwindle until customers have no alternative to the Google-based infotainment systems.
Editors' Recommendations Apple wants to supercharge CarPlay, but here’s why carmakers won’t bite GMC poured all of its truck-making expertise into the Sierra EV pickup The next generation of Apple CarPlay will power your entire car, riding the trend of all-screen autos BMW shipping cars without advertised Apple and Google features Every car compatible with Apple CarPlay Apple Tech News Cars Rumors of an Apple Car continue to circulate, such is the apparent appeal of Apple making the jump from smartphones, tablets, and computers to electric cars. While Apple doesn't appear to be anywhere near close to launching its own car, Vanarama, a car-lease broker based in the U.K., has created an Apple Car rendering to add to the pile of speculation.
It's common for U.K. companies like this to distribute vehicle renderings for publicity, which is why a leasing firm is offering up Apple Car speculation. Vanarama claims this rendering is based on real Apple patents, although that still doesn't provide a clear picture of what a real Apple electric car would be like.
Cars General Motors has issued a recall of its Chevy Bolt electric vehicle that expands on an earlier recall. The notice affects all 2020 to 2022 model year Chevy Bolts and all remaining 2019 models.
The recall comes in response to multiple reports of fires linked to the vehicle’s LG-made battery pack.
Mobile Apple CarPlay overrides your car's native infotainment system and promises to put a familiar, distraction-free interface right at your fingertips. It's also loaded with compatible third-party apps that give your car nearly the same level of functionality as your iPhone or iPad. We've put together a list of the best CarPlay apps available in July 2020.
