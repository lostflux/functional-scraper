Of course, winning a match often comes down to luck, but there are many things you can do to increase your odds of being the last squad standing.
Communicate effectively Adjust your settings Stick with your team Do not quit If you’re going to snipe, use these rifles Stock up on the right supplies Suppressors aren’t as useful Change your ping colors Practice on Resurgence maps Try an alternate route Hold your fire Watch the pros In this guide, we’ll go through eight essential tips and tricks to help you survive and excel in Warzone.
Communicate effectively Image used with permission by copyright holder Communication was key in the original Warzone and that hasn’t changed in the sequel. This is arguably the most important thing to consider, as so many gunfights are lost due to poor planning and comms. Make sure to call out when and where you see an enemy, and try to use your pings as effectively as possible.
One new feature in the latest version of Warzone is proximity chat, which can be extremely useful when approaching a new point of interest. You’ll be able to hear enemy players talking with one another, and if you do, try and keep quiet so they don’t hear you — this will allow you to sneak up on them with ease. Likewise, you can also use proximity chat to force an enemy player to give you all their cash and gear, which is a fun little feature.
Adjust your settings Image used with permission by copyright holder Before you even jump into a match, we recommend adjusting your settings so the game feels and plays how you expect. There’s no shortage of settings to adjust, so make sure to visit our dedicated guide for more details. The main things you want to change are the sensitivity, button layout, armor plate behavior, and your field of view.
Stick with your team For whatever reason, players like to drift away from their teammates, which is almost always a recipe for disaster. Whether you’re playing with random players or a consistent team, you’ll want to make sure you always stick together, even right from the start of a match. Specifically, if you mark a landing spot, and someone else pings another one, it might not be a bad idea to pivot to the other location to ensure everyone is together — even if the new location isn’t ideal. Likewise, if your team is ready to move on from a particular spot, always try to go with them. With that in mind, it’s smart to consistently check your map so you’re always aware of your squad’s location.
Do not quit Speaking of sticking with your team, we recommend staying in the match, even after you’ve been eliminated. You’d be surprised how often players are willing to buy back teammates during the end portion of a match. The thing is, it’s not too difficult to regain in Warzone, so your chances of coming back and winning — even with fewer teammates — aren’t as low as you’d think. This is because enemy squads will likely be missing players, as well (due to players quitting), evening the odds.
If you’re going to snipe, use these rifles Image used with permission by copyright holder Sniping in the new version of Warzone works differently than in the previous game. With the exception of a handful of rifles, it’ll take multiple shots to secure one-hit eliminations to the head. The rifles you’ll want to use are the FJX Imperium, Victus XMR, or the MCPR-300. So long as you equip them with explosive rounds, they will down a player in one hit to the head. Keep in mind, explosive rounds tank your weapon’s bullet velocity.
Stock up on the right supplies Image used with permission by copyright holder Even veteran players can lose certain gunfights if they aren’t prepared. That’s why it’s recommended to stock up on items before the end of a match. These include a Durable Gas Mask, a Self-Revive Kit, a UAV, and plenty of ammo and shields for the final battle.
One thing you should be aware of is that your stored gas masks actually lose durability while in the gas (even if you aren’t wearing one), so it doesn’t pay to keep several of them stored. You can, however, drop them off and come back to pick them up without them losing durability, but that doesn’t always work out in a practical sense.
If you use your Self-Revive Kit or some of your items, you should do your best to restock them as safely as possible, as they can save your life.
Suppressors aren’t as useful Unfortunately, suppressors are often a hindrance in Warzone.
 This is due to a number of factors, mainly because they hurt aim down sights (ADS) speed and cause smoke to come out of the weapon, obstructing your view. Instead, we advise picking a muzzle break to help reduce the smoke, while also providing some long-range benefits. You still won’t appear on the mini map when firing an unsuppressed weapon, so there aren’t many downsides to skipping this attachment type.
Change your ping colors Image used with permission by copyright holder One of the major flaws of Warzone is that the default ping color is white, and can often be hard to track across buildings and other assets in the environment. Instead of sticking with the default ping, we advise swapping over to something brighter. To do so, visit Color Customization from the Interface menu, and change Neutral to something like pink or purple, allowing you to see your pings more clearly.
Practice on Resurgence maps Activision The standard battle royale mode is fun, but it can be off-putting, especially to newcomers. Thankfully, the game offers a popular Resurgence mode that allows players to continuously respawn (so long as at least one teammate remains alive). This can be invaluable to players looking to experiment with different weapons and playing styles, as the risk is much lower than in standard battle royale. There are two Resurgence maps — Vondel and Ashika Island — and both are extremely fun to play.
Try an alternate route Oftentimes, two opposing players will notice one another from afar before firing at each other. When this happens, don’t make the obvious choice by running directly at your opponent. Instead, find a different route — possibly one that leads behind or above your enemies — to get the drop on them. Even if your aim isn’t the best, you’ll likely win the gunfight if you start firing at your opponent’s back.
Hold your fire Activision Most players’ initial instinct is to fire at anything that moves, but in Warzone , that’s often a mistake. The time to kill in this game is slow, meaning it takes a lot of bullets to fully down an opponent. This means you likely won’t be able to fully secure the elimination from afar when your opponents are around cover. Instead, wait for your enemies to be in an open area, or hold your fire until you can get in close. Alerting your foes to your presence by firing early will do you no good.
Watch the pros Playing Warzone will only get you so far. If you want to excel and push your skills, we recommend following some of the best Warzone YouTubers and streamers, as they often provide the community with important weapon stats, gameplay tips, and much more. There’s no shortage of content creators out there, but we highly recommend JGOD , TrueGameData , and WhosImmortal.
Editors' Recommendations The best Call of Duty games, ranked Modern Warfare 3 Zombies: Mercenary Convoy guide Is Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 cross-platform? How to access the Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 beta Gamescom Opening Night Live 2023: how to watch and what to expect Gaming Activision Blizzard has fully pulled back the curtain on Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III following an in-game event in its predecessor. This came alongside new gameplay that concludes by teasing a rebooted version of the series' infamous No Russian mission.
The gameplay trailer focuses on the campaign missions, which got a lot more detail in a post on the game's website. It affirms that the game follows Task Force 141 as they take on Vladimir Makarov and will feature some "Open Combat Missions" that give players multiple ways to complete objectives. The gameplay seems to mainly feature a stealthy run to one of these levels. Of course, the trailer's most shocking moment comes at the end.
Gameplay Reveal Trailer | Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III We see Makarov text someone "No Russian," before they pull out a gun on a crowded plane. If you don't remember, No Russian was one of the original Modern Warfare II's most infamous missions, as it had players partake in a mass shooting terrorist attack at an airport with Russians. The level has influenced the tone of this rebooted Modern Warfare series, and it now looks like Modern Warfare III is set to reimagine this mission in some way, following up the Modern Warfare II post-credit scene that referenced it.
While the trailer focused on the campaign mainly, that post confirmed a lot of new info on multiplayer and Modern Warfare Zombies too. Its multiplayer features all 16 launch maps from 2009's Modern Warfare II, two larger Battle maps for Ground War and Invasion, and an even bigger War map for the return of the War Mode introduced in Call of Duty: WWII. Map voting returns, so you can have a say in where you want to play a match. Finally, Activision says Modern Warfare Zombies takes place in a new open world where players will fight Dark Aether Zombies, complete missions, and incorporate Extraction game elements.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III launches on PC, PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S on November 10.
Gaming Activision has just teased lots of new details about Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III, which launches this November. That includes the fact that the game will contain a Zombies mode, more open-ended campaign missions, and introduce a new "Call of Duty HQ" that will serve as a hub for all future Call of Duty games.
These details were all revealed in a new blog post posted on the series' website ahead of the in-game event that will give us our first in-depth look at Modern Warfare II. In it, Activision clears up a lot of rumors about the game to try and show that Modern Warfare III is still an "incredible, premium annual game experience across Campaign, Multiplayer and Co-operative modes" despite reportedly starting development as a Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II expansion.
Some of the features listed we already knew about, like the fact that this year's campaign features Makarov as a villain and that players can carry over their progression and inventory from Modern Warfare II. Others are new, though, like the fact that the campaign will feature new "Open Combat" missions. That seems to imply that Modern Warfare III's campaign levels will offer more freedom than is typical in a Call of Duty level. When it comes to multiplayer, the post states that players can expect new combat vest, perk, tac-stance movement, and after-market parts systems in addition to some Riochet Anti-Cheat Improvements.
More importantly, it's finally officially confirmed that this year's game will feature a Zombies mode. Titled Modern Warfare Zombies, Activision calls it the "largest Zombies offering to date." Finally, Activision made it clear that it plans on keeping all Call of Duty content closely bundled together going forward. After Modern Warfare III launches, Call of Duty HQ will be introduced and serve as "one access point for your future Call of Duty content." While there aren't many specifics on all of these things, we at least now have a broader picture of what to expect from Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III when it launches on November 10.
Gaming In Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, players have access to a wide variety of multiplayer game modes including Team Deathmatch, Search and Destroy, and the new Prisoner Capture. One of the most popular modes in the series is Hardcore, which has been in the series for years. This intense mode removes the HUD and increases damage across the board. But does this mode appear in the new Modern Warfare 2? Here's what you need to know about the Hardcore mode in Modern Warfare 2.
Does Modern Warfare 2 have a Hardcore mode? When Modern Warfare 2 first launched, it didn't have a Hardcode mode, much to the disappointment of fans. Instead, the game had a mode called Tier 1, which was basically a rudimentary version of Hardcore mode, with some missing features. For instance, there's no HUD, whatsoever, no hitmarkers, and no killfeed, which made the mode hard to actually play in some cases. Thankfully, Activision finally did add Hardcore more at the start of 2023, replacing the Tier 1 mode from before.
