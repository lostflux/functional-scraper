Ultimate online with friends By Gabe Gurwin Close Super Smash Bros.
has been a Nintendo staple since its initial release in 1999. Since then, there have been quite a few iterations and, so far, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate has been one of the best. Although it isn’t immune from annoyances, it is still one of the most solid games, introducing new fighters and levels that haven’t been seen in previous games in the franchise. Although Nintendo has made playing online a bit of a hassle, it’s not impossible to do.

Ultimate Difficulty Duration What You Need Nintendo Switch Online subscription With these tips, you can quickly play with your friends, even if they aren’t with you on your couch.

Ultimate beginner's guide The best Nintendo Switch games for 2021 Everything you need to know about Nintendo Switch Online Image used with permission by copyright holder How to create a Battle Arena You can’t simply send your friend an invitation to play Super Smash Bros. Ultimate like you can in games on Xbox One and PlayStation 4. Instead, you’re going to have to use the Battle Arena system.
The Battle Arena is essentially a continuous lobby where your friends can spectate matches and participate in their own, depending on the ruleset you specify when creating it. There are public Battle Arenas available, but for the sake of this guide, we’ll cover how to create ones that only your friends can join.
Step 1: Select Battle Arena from the online menu and then select the option to create your own Battle Arena.
Step 2: From here, you’ll see a menu with several different options. Change the visibility to Friends and, if you want to protect it with a password, you can hit the X button to enable that function.

For groups with more than two people, you are able to also change the order in which new players will be added to fights. Typically, the bottom player will exit the “ring,” but you can change this to the top player if you prefer.
If you did set a password — which can be necessary if you have an active friends list full of Smash players — your only real option is to let your friends know the password outside of the game.
Image used with permission by copyright holder How to join a Battle Arena Joining a friend’s Battle Arena is much simpler than creating your own.
Step 1: Select the Battle Arena option from the online menu and choose to join an arena.
Step 2: On the next page, select to join a friend’s arena rather than a public one.
If none of your friends have created an arena yet, this next screen will greet you with an error message. If your friends have built an arena and are ready to host battles, then you’ll see the list of them on this page. Every arena listed will be ready to join, so select your arena and start fighting your friends.
Play cooperatively While you can play with others online, you don’t have the option to pick your companions, so you won’t be able to select your friends and work together with them. Instead of going to the Battle Arena, you need to go to Quickplay and select Co-op to start.
Image used with permission by copyright holder How to chat with friends in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate Unfortunately, you aren’t able to voice chat with anyone that’s not playing a game on the Nintendo Switch. However, after you’ve constructed a Battle Arena and are battling it out with your friends, you can start using the Nintendo Switch Online app’s voice chat feature.
Be aware that the chat function doesn’t automatically start; you’ll need to make your Battle Arena first. Once you’re done with that, click the *Y *button, which will allow you to access More Settings. After this, you can turn on voice chat, adjust the room music to whatever you’re in the mood for, enable Spirits, or change stages.
The truth is FaceTime and Skype are more user-friendly and dependable platforms if you want to voice chat with your friends. We highly suggest using these platforms throughout your Battle Arena journey. These apps are best used while you’re downloading Battle Arena at the start, so it makes sense just to keep it as your go-to chat app when you’re chatting with your gamer friends while playing.
Editors' Recommendations Best armor and weapons in Super Mario RPG and where to find them All Melody Bay song solutions in Super Mario RPG Sony’s new PlayStation earbuds are a perfect match — for my Nintendo Switch Super Mario RPG is halfway between a remaster and remake Our 10 favorite Wonder Effects in Super Mario Bros. Wonder How-To Guides Nintendo Nintendo Switch Gaming While I’m only partway through Super Mario Bros. Wonder, I’m already utterly in love with the game.
As our glowing review outlined, it’s a highly polished 2D platformer that’s approachable for anyone to play and elicits a joyous and vibrant sense of wonder. But for me, what makes Super Mario Bros. Wonder special aren't so much the wild Wonder effects or elephant transformations. It's the subtle touches. These elements might not be immediately noticeable or relevant to most, but they all work together to create an experience that’s a step above most other platformers.
Changes enhance enjoyment Super Mario Bros. Wonder isn’t afraid to show that it’s different from previous Mario games through small moments and changes. One instance that illustrates this early on is in one of the first Bowser Jr. fights. It starts like all his New Super Mario Bros. boss fights do, with him getting in his shell and spinning toward Mario. At first, I was disappointed that Nintendo was just doing the same thing again, but after the first hit, that changed. Bowser Jr. activates a Wonder effect and changes in size for the following two stages of his fight. It's a moment of surprise that subverts my expectations, which are based on decades of Mario games. This is a small moment and reference that many Super Mario Bros. Wonder players probably won’t even internalize. Still, it is a smart way to show how the platformer differs from what came before.
Gaming Super Mario Bros. Wonder is taking the series back to its 2D roots with a new and exciting art style and a ton of new mechanics. Alongside new power-ups and badges, this title has perhaps the largest amount of collectibles and hidden secrets of any game in the series. Between all the Wonder Seeds, Wonder Flowers, Flower Coins, and more, there's no shortage of things to do as you run, jump, and flip your way through all the various worlds. Among all the playable characters to choose from, one non-playable character makes his triumphant return. Captain Toad has managed to make his way to the Flower Kingdom, but this intrepid explorer is not so easy to find. Each time you interact with him, he will reward you with some Flower Coins and a hint at an upcoming world, so let's hunt down all his locations in Super Mario Wonder.
All Captain Toad locations Captain Toad appears in five unique spots on the Super Mario Bros. Wonder world map. Talking to him at each spot will give you a little bit more of his story, plus the aforementioned rewards.
First Captain Toad location Gaming If you've got a Nintendo Switch Online subscription, Super Mario Bros. Wonder features a wide variety of online multiplayer functionalities, including the ability to see other players around the world playing alongside you and to lay down standees for them to use for revival in their own games. But more importantly, the game offers full-fledged online multiplayer with friends, allowing you to connect and explore the overworld and individual stages together as if you were seated on the same couch! You can even engage in races against your pals by hitting the Race Block at the beginning of many stages. Here's how to get started playing Super Mario Bros. Wonder online with friends.
