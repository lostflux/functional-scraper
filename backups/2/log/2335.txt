 If accurate, the deal marks the end of a long period that saw Samsung Electronics and LG Electronics trading sometimes vicious barbs over the merits of Samsung’s quantum dot-infused QLED TVs versus LG’s organic light-emitting diode (OLED) TVs.
Citing sources with direct knowledge of the deal, Reuters said that LG Display will supply 2 million OLED panels in 2024 and boost shipments to 3 million and 5 million units in subsequent years. These panels will initially be 77- and 83-inch units, which suggests that Samsung is looking to bolster the higher end of its TV lineup.
Intriguingly, this is not the first time such a deal has been discussed — in 2021, Korean news outlets reported a very similar story.
 At the time, the speculation was that Samsung would buy one million panels from LG in 2021, and another four million panels in 2022. Both LG and Samsung denied that there was any truth to that report.
LG’s M-Series Wireless OLED TV is the future we need This Samsung S90C OLED TV news is literally huge Samsung confirms its 2023 QD-OLED TVs start at just $1,900, are available now Early in 2022, Samsung confirmed rumors that it was going to start embracing OLED technology, but with a twist. It launched the first TVs based on QD-OLED panels built by its sister company, Samsung Display. QD-OLED uses quantum dots combined with OLED pixels to produce a picture that is, in theory, brighter and more color accurate than OLED alone.
The new technology proved very successful. Digital Trends’ Caleb Dension has given very high marks to both the Samsung S95B and Sony A95K , the two QD-OLED TVs we have reviewed so far. However, on a screen size basis, QD-OLED is still more expensive in most cases than OLED, which suggests that Samsung might start to reserve QD-OLED for its flagship models as it introduces standard OLED as a more affordable, yet still premium option.
This would let the company address the increased pressure from competitors like TCL. TCL just released its 2023 TV lineup , which includes the QM8 mini-LED flagship — a TV that uses the same backlight technology as Samsung’s best Neo QLED models, but at prices that substantially undercut what Samsung charges.
Going with OLED panels from LG Display would give Samsung’s TVs a picture quality advantage that would be harder for TCL and other makers to duplicate.
According to Reuters, the deal also helps LG Display, which has been struggling to get its OLED manufacturing running at full capacity.

The chance to go hands-on with not one, but three of Samsung's most hotly anticipated TVs for 2023.
I got up close and personal with the 65-inch QN95C Neo QLED, the 75-inch QN900C 8K Neo QLED, and the 77-inch S95C QD-OLED. I had Samsung representatives on hand to address questions as I had them, and I got the opportunity to make some comparisons among the TVs that I don't often get a chance to do so soon after the TVs have been announced.
Audio / Video We got our first taste of Samsung's 2023 mini-LED backlit, Neo QLED TVs at CES 2023, and now we know what (most of) the new models will cost. The company has released pricing for its flagship QN900C Neo QLED 8K TV, as well as its 8K QN800C, and three 4K models: the QN95C, QN90C, and QN85C. All five TVs will be available in a variety of sizes at a mix of authorized retailers starting the week of February 20, 2023. Not every size will be available immediately and the king-of-the-hill 85-inch QN900C remains under wraps for now.
Though there are specific differences among the new 2023 Neo QLED models, all five possess: Audio / Video Confirming an earlier leak, Samsung has formally announced the price of its 77-inch 4K QD-OLED TV, the S95C. The new model which was shown first at CES 2023, will sell for $4,500.
