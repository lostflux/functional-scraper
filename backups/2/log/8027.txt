Why trust us? What’s new on Paramount+ in November 2023 By Blair Marnell Close Lawman: Bass Reeves is arriving on Paramount+ in November, and to no one’s surprise, it’s the new original series written and created by Taylor Sheridan, the guy behind almost all of the streamer’s high-profile shows. Just to illustrate that point, Sheridan created or co-created Mayor of Kingstown , 1883 , Tulsa King , 1923 , Special Ops: Lioness , and a little show for The Paramount Network called Yellowstone.
 That means a sizable audience is going to be checking out Sheridan’s take on the life of the first black Deputy U.S. Marshal west of the Mississippi River.
For comedy fans, Paramount+ is premiering the original movie, Good Burger 2 , while cinema lovers will be able to dive into all three of The Godfather films and a wide assortment of modern and classic flicks. That’s in addition to Paramount+’s live sporting events which will be streamed throughout the month.

Entertainment Sci-fi films never go out of style. From Alien and Back to the Future to Dune and Blade Runner, sci-fi films continue to improve thanks to new technology. Many sci-fi films find a home on Netflix and wind up on the streamer's 10 most popular movies list. Films like Don't Look Up, The Adam Project, and Bird Box are 10 of the most popular English films on Netflix ever.
The Adam Project is one of our picks for sci-fi movies to watch in November. Other selections include the epic sequel to Godzilla: King of the Monsters, and a sci-fi thriller about a pilot's fight for survival against the dinosaurs.
Godzilla vs. Kong (2021) Entertainment Sin City hosts Sunday Night Football as the Las Vegas Raiders (4-5) welcome the New York Jets (4-4) to Allegiant Stadium in Week 10. The game will start at 8:20 p.m. ET/5:20 p.m. PT on November 12. Mike Tirico, Cris Collinsworth, and Melissa Stark are on the call for NBC, and the game will also stream on Peacock.
Despite their mediocre records, the Jets and Raiders are hunting for a Wild Card spot in the AFC. The Jets must improve their offense if they want any shot at the postseason. The Jets have a league-worst eight offensive touchdowns on the season. For Las Vegas, the Raiders fired head coach Josh McDaniels before Week 9 and promoted Antonio Pierce to interim coach. The Raiders responded by beating the Giants 30-6.
