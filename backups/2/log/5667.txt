Online games are susceptible to all types of problems beyond the player’s control, leading to plenty of frustration and disappointment in a possibly ruined experience. While there are more substantial issues that can completely prevent you from playing, seeing the packet burst issue is almost worse because, while it does let you play, you will experience a ton of lag that makes the game essentially unplayable. If you’ve been struck by a packet burst error in Modern Warfare 3, here are some possible solutions so you can get back to fragging.
How to fix packet burst errors Activision If you spot a symbol of three squares on the left of your screen while playing Modern Warfare 3, it means you’re suffering from a packet burst. This is essentially an error where something is messed up in the communication between your system and the game’s servers, resulting in terrible performance. While it could be simply an issue on the server side and not related to you at all, which you can check by looking at the Modern Warfare 3 server status here , there are a few things you can do to potentially fix the issue on your end.
The first is to simply give your console or PC a fresh restart to make sure your game is fully up to date and properly running.

If you are on Wi-Fi, also try using an ethernet cable if that’s an option.
If you are on a console, some have reported that turning crossplay off can resolve the issue.

Modern Warfare 3 preload guide: release time, file size, and preorder All weapons in Payday 3 and how to unlock them Gaming Making your character can take a long time if you really want to get all the details right. From your race, class, hairstyle, and more, you have a lot of options to tweak before ever starting your adventure. If you're a little too excited, you might end up slacking off on making your character and assuming you can update it later just so you can get right into the action. If so, or you simply want to change up your look after a couple of hours into this massive game, you'll be at a loss as to how, if you even can, change your appearance in Baldur's Gate 3. You may not fully like the answer, but here's the best you can do in terms of altering your appearance after you've exited the character creator.
Can you change your appearance in Baldur's Gate 3? The answer to this is technically yes, but not in the way you would hope. To get it out of the way, no, there's no way to return to the character creation screen after you've finalized your character. Unlike respeccing your character, there's no NPC, item, or magic mirror anywhere in The Forgotten Realms that will let you change your appearance.
Gaming Romance options are by no means new in the CRPG genre. Even more traditional RPGs have added romance options for certain characters, but each game handles the process of actually entering into a romantic relationship differently. Baldur's Gate 3 is packed with interesting characters and companions that could catch your eye. Even if you're not new to CRPGs, it's always a challenge to understand what a certain character will like or dislike, as well as what actually counts as moving closer to a relationship with them. Thankfully, Baldur's Gate 3 developer Larian has made it so that there are no restrictions on who you can romance based on your chosen gender or race, so all that's left to do is study up on how to woo your dearly beloved.
All romance options and how to romance them There are eight possible characters you can enter into a relationship in Baldur's Gate 3, including all available companions. Relationships are based on earning positive opinions from them and hinge on the actions you take in the world with them in your party. Even if what you're doing doesn't directly impact them, they will think differently based on what they see you do, so keep that in mind before you do something your love interest might think less of you for. Also, be sure to speak to them each time you go to camp to further their individual stories.
You can check the approval rating for all characters under the Detailed View section of your character sheet. Make sure it is high before you do the quest where you rescue the refugees.
Astarion Gaming The story in Baldur's Gate 3 is shared equally between your own created character and your party of companions. Each one you choose to team up with has their own personalities, backstories, and goals that you can choose to help them accomplish during your travels through the Forgotten Realms. While you can only have three accompany you at any one time, there are far more that you can recruit and swap in and out to best suit the challenges ahead, or just to get a new perspective on events. Essentially, all companions are missable, even the early ones you're all but forced to interact with, but there are others that are harder to get, and some you have to choose between. Here's a full list of every potential companion in Baldur's Gate 3 and what you need to do to add them to your party.
All companions There are 10 potential companions to recruit in Baldur's Gate 3, each of a different race, class, and background. Some you meet early, some late, and others not at all depending on your choices.
Shadowheart The Cleric of the group, this is your first potential companion. As long as you choose to save her from her pod-thing on the Nautiloid ship in the opening of the game, you will find her on the beach you crash-land on. If you decided not to save her on the ship, you can still add her to your team by finding her farther east down the beach near the Dank Crypt.
