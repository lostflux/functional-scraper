Why trust us? The best free PS5 games By Jesse Lennox Close Putting aside the launch of the PlayStation 3, the PlayStation 5 is the most expensive a Sony console has ever been. That hasn’t stopped it from being one of the most sought-after products of the year due to the power it has over the PS4. There’s no denying that this system is a worthwhile investment for any gamer who wants to experience console gaming at the highest quality for the next several years at least.
Still, that heavy upfront cost can force you to be a little more selective with what games you buy right away. Now that games are regularly costing $70 new, you may end up wanting to wait for the bigger exclusives that you know will be great. That doesn’t mean your PS5 has to sit there gathering dust. There are plenty of free games you can jump into right now for hours of enjoyment without spending a dime. There are games here that cater to all types of players, so check out the best free PS5 games available right now.

Editors' Recommendations Best Black Friday gaming laptop deals: Cheapest prices today PS5 Black Friday deals: consoles, games, and accessories Best PS5 SSD Black Friday deals: Add more storage to your PS5 now The best gaming chair Black Friday deals you can shop now This PS5 bundle just got a price cut for the holidays Buying Guides Best Products Buying Guides Sony Sony PlayStation Sony PlayStation 5 Gaming When we think of Black Friday, we think of a great time to get cool stocking stuffers and hobby essentials for our loved ones just as much as big ticket items for ourselves. This year, we're finding that early Black Friday deals are giving us the best of both worlds, especially now that Walmart's Black Friday deals have launched. For example, the official PS5 DualSense controller (one of the best controllers in its own right) is on sale now for just $49. That's $21 down from its usual $70 price point, making it a great way to help open up multiplayer gaming for yourself, a friend, or kid. Just tap the button below to shop for yours today, or keep reading if you need to know more about it.
Why you should buy a PS5 DualSense controller Sometimes we can look down on the original of something, preferring more fancy alternatives that come out later and refine the model. The PS5 DualSense controller, however, is innovative in its own right. We've praised its haptic feedback, which makes you feel the weight of your actions as you pull on the controller's triggers, since we first discussed the PS5 DualSense's innovations and we're no less happy now. Just pair the controller with a PS5 compatible headset and you're ready for multi-sensory immersion.
Gaming The PlayStation 5 is looking to dominate the console landscape with its incredible library of games. Like the rest of the industry, Sony saw several major game delays in 2022 (and more this year), but has since dropped several new hit games like God of War Ragnarok, the Resident Evil 4 remake, and Alan Wake 2, among others. There are plenty of games out on PS5 for every kind of gamer.
And there are plenty more great titles on the way — don't forget to check out our list of the best upcoming PS5 games that will come out later this year.
Gaming The Nintendo Switch has had a lot of success in the nearly six years since its release. The console-handheld hybrid has been on the market since 2017, and a slew of fantastic games from first- and third-party developers have launched over the course of the system's life cycle. Recently, heavy hitters such as Metroid Dread, Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, and Kirby and the Forgotten Land have boosted the system's appeal, while a healthy list of upcoming Switch games continues to drum up excitement.
There are plenty of incredible games to enjoy on the Switch right now. But which ones should you check out? These are the best Nintendo Switch games (including free-to-play titles) for 2023.
