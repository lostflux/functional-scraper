Until now, the term “QLED ” was a Samsung-controlled trademark and appeared exclusively in the branding of Samsung LCD TVs that use quantum dots. With this new alliance, that exclusivity is no longer the case. Hisense and TCL, despite both being major competitors with Samsung, will now be able to use the QLED terminology on their displays using quantum dot tech. This opens the door for future partnerships between other TV manufacturers who may want to get in on the QLED push.
This is an obvious move against LG, which has formed a similar coalition to promote and distribute OLED TVs — the major competition to QLED. While Samsung had been open about the possibility of letting competitors use the QLED terminology, the growing popularity of OLED likely put pressure on the company to finally make these deals.
Samsung’s biggest Neo QLED 8K TV comes with an equally huge price This Samsung S90C OLED TV news is literally huge After years of bashing OLED, Samsung now set to buy panels from LG The announcement was made in Beijing during the first Chinese Electronics Chamber of Commerce- (CECC) hosted QLED International Forum. The event included a presentation by the nanotech company, Nanosys, detailing its roadmap for the future of quantum dot technology, including the eventual introduction of “true QLED” TVs into the consumer market sometime in the future (though the company made no predictions as to how soon that will be).
QLED TVs currently on the market on the are actually a type of LCD TV with a quantum dot filter in the display. This filters light from the LED for better color, thus enhancing the TV’s performance and picture quality. In the future, true QLED TVs will ditch the LCD technology and instead use a full array quantum dots for picture generation. These true QLED TVs will reportedly not only achieve the brightness and color only quantum dots are capable of, but also the true blacks that OLED is known for.
At the event, Samsung, Hisense, and TCL all showed off a number of upcoming QLED TVs, all of which use a quantum dot filter or screen and are not yet “true QLED.” However, Samsung assures that its current LCD-based QLED TVs can compete with the OLED TVs on the market. While we wait for the true QLED TVs to finally make an appearance, we are sure to see an increase in QLED LCDs in stores soon.

Samsung confirms its 2023 QD-OLED TVs start at just $1,900, are available now Does QD-OLED have a burn-in problem? Business News LG Samsung Tech News TV Audio / Video LG has announced the pricing and availability of its 2023 OLED 4K and 8K TV lineup, including the eagerly anticipated OLED evo G3 Gallery Edition -- the first 4K OLED TV to make use of microlens array (MLA) technology for enhanced brightness, color, and viewing angles.

Audio / Video What could be worth traveling 3,000 miles in a cramped airplane to New Jersey? The chance to go hands-on with not one, but three of Samsung's most hotly anticipated TVs for 2023.
I got up close and personal with the 65-inch QN95C Neo QLED, the 75-inch QN900C 8K Neo QLED, and the 77-inch S95C QD-OLED. I had Samsung representatives on hand to address questions as I had them, and I got the opportunity to make some comparisons among the TVs that I don't often get a chance to do so soon after the TVs have been announced.
Audio / Video I recently flew to New Jersey to go hands-on with Samsung’s top three 2023 TVs. I measured. I viewed. In the end, one of them floored me.
During my one-day visit, I was able to get hands-on with the 65-inch Samsung QN95C Neo QLED, a 75-inch Samsung QN900C 8K Neo QLED, and the much anticipated 77-inch Samsung S95C OLED — aka QD-OLED TV.
