Why trust us? This HP laptop almost does it all for under $1,000 By Mark Coppock Close $900.00 Excellent productivity performance Solid battery life Good keyboard and touchpad Spectacular OLED display Strong value if purchased at Costco Lid is a little flexible No discrete GPU option Audio quality is poor Laptops under $1,000 commonly have some major problems. But more recently, there are a growing number of options, whether that’s the Zenbook 14 OLED or the MacBook Air M1.
Specs and configurations A mostly unchanged design that’s just fine Competitive productivity performance OLED’s great, ho-hum Another excellent 14-inch OLED value, if you buy from the right place The new HP Pavilion Plus 14 is one such option. This isn’t a brand-new design, as I reviewed the previous Intel generation last year and found it to be a compelling laptop for the price. This time I’m reviewing the AMD version, which offers some advantages and disadvantages compared to the Intel model. It’s even more affordable, if you buy from the right place, and the 2023 Pavilion Plus 14 is a strong competitor against a growing field of laptops.
Best laptop deals: Save on HP, Lenovo, Dell and Apple The best HP laptops to buy in 2023 Acer’s new gaming laptop bring Nvidia RTX 40-series GPUs under $1,000 Specs and configurations HP Pavilion Plus 14 2023 Dimensions 12.63 inches x 8.94 inches x 0.69-0.74 inches Weight 3.19 pounds Processor AMD Ryzen 5 7540U AMD Ryzen 7 7840U Graphics AMD Radeon M780 Graphics RAM 16GB Display 14.0-inch 16:10 WUXGA (1,920 x 1,200) IPS 14.0-inch 16:10 WQXGA (2,560 x 1,600) IPS 14.0-inch 16:10 2.8K (2,880 x 1,800) OLED, 120Hz Storage 512GB SSD 1TB SSD Touch No Ports 2 x USB-C 1 x USB-A 1 x HDMI 2.1 1 x 3.5mm audio jack Wireless Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3 Webcam 5MP with infrared camera for Windows 11 Hello facial recognition Operating system Windows 11 Battery 51 watt-hours 68 watt-hours Price $850+ The AMD version of the Pavilion Plus 14 starts at $850 for a Ryzen 5 7540U CPU, 16GB of RAM, a 512GB SSD, and a 14.0-inch WUXGA IPS display. All models are limited to integrated AMD Radeon 780M graphics, with no discrete graphics offering. At the high end, which is my review unit, you’ll spend $1,230 on HP’s web store for a Ryzen 7 7840U, 16GB of RAM, a 1TB SSD, and a 14.0-inch OLED panel. However, the same Pavilion Plus 14 configuration is available at Costco for just $900, which is a very attractive price. Note that those without a Costco membership will spend an additional 5%, making the price $945.
That Costco price is about $100 less than a similarly configured Asus Zenbook 14X OLED (although with just 512GB of storage), which uses Intel H-series CPUs. This laptop will provide an interesting comparison as we run through the review.
A mostly unchanged design that’s just fine Mark Coppock / Digital Trends The Pavilion Plus 14’s design remains mostly unchanged from the previous generation. It’s a tiny bit thicker and heavier than before, but not enough that you would notice. The Zenbook 14X OLED is thinner at 0.67 inches versus 0.74 inches for the HP, but heavier at 3.44 pounds versus 3.19 pounds. Even though the Zenbook has a larger 14.5-inch display, it’s smaller in width and depth thanks to thinner bezels (more below). The Pavilion Plus 14’s construction remains all-aluminum, and the lid is a lot more flexible than I remember on the previous generation. The chassis is solid, though, making the laptop’s build quality good, but not great for a midrange machine. The Asus Zenbook 14X, which will be mentioned often in this review, was more rigid overall.
Aesthetically, the Pavilion Plus 14 is yet another minimalist design with simple lines, a subdued chrome HP logo on the lid, and a slight edge below the keyboard adding a little bit of flair. It’s available in three colors, Natural Silver (my review unit), Tranquil Pink, and Moonlight Blue. It’s an attractive laptop overall. The display bezels are thin along the sides, but rather large on the top and bottom, and they’re plastic. That detracts from a modern and quality feel.
Mark Coppock / Digital Trends The keyboard has large keycaps with bold lettering and plenty of spacing. The switches were light, with a nice firm click and a comfortable bottoming action in my testing. However, they weren’t as snappy and responsive as those on some better keyboards, like HP’s Spectre line. I didn’t find it as precise for longer typing sessions. The touchpad is large and comfortable, with firm and quiet clicks. The Pavilion Plus 14 can’t be purchased with a touch display, if that’s important to you.
There are plenty of ports, including some for legacy devices. The biggest limitation is there’s no Thunderbolt 4 support due to the AMD chipset. Wireless connectivity is up to date.
Finally, the webcam is a high-resolution 5MP version that provides excellent video. There’s an infrared camera for Windows 11 Hello facial recognition support that worked quickly and reliably.
Competitive productivity performance Mark Coppock / Digital Trends My Pavilion Plus 14 review unit was equipped with the Ryzen 7 7840U, a 28-watt CPU with eight cores and 16 threads running at up to 5.1GHz. In most of our CPU-intensive benchmarks, the processor did well against the Intel Core i7-13700H, another popular choice for manufacturers that want a little extra horsepower. The Intel chip runs at 45 watts and has 14 cores (six Performance and eight Efficient) and 20 threads, running at up to 5.0GHz. The new model is also faster than the previous generation with the Core i7-12700H.
HP didn’t provide its Command Center utility to enable different performance modes, so I tested in just the default balanced mode. The Pavilion Plus 14 provides plenty of performance for demanding productivity workflows, and light creators will find it speedy enough as well. The integrated Radeon 780M Graphics are a bit faster than Intel’s Iris Xe, but not enough to make gaming a reasonable proposition.

My review unit had a 68 watt-hour battery, not the 51 watt-hour version in some configurations (be careful when ordering), which is plenty for a 14-inch laptop. So, I was expecting the Pavilion Plus 14 to demonstrate superior battery life.
Mark Coppock / Digital Trends It did, but not by much. It lasted about an hour longer than the Asus Zenbook 14X OLED in our suite of battery tests, which is less than I expected. Even so, battery life was a little above average and promises good longevity. Note that battery life on the previous generation was poor, making this model a significant upgrade if battery life matters to you.
You likely won’t get a full day of battery life if your tasks are at all demanding, but with a lighter workflow, you might make it that long. Of course, the Apple MacBook Air M2 remains the battery life champion.

There’s nothing “ho-hum” about getting a great OLED display at these prices. The Asus Zenbook 14 OLED has OLED for less, but not by all that much. This is, as usual, a spectacular display that looks awesome out of the box. Colors are dynamic, blacks are inky, and all content – including high dynamic range ( HDR ) video – looks great. The Pavilion Plus 14 also supports IMAX Enhanced, which provides several benefits such as special aspect ratios on supported content (mostly available from Disney+).
According to my colorimeter, this OLED panel is as good as the average. It’s bright at 412 nits, and it has wide colors at 100% of sRGB, 95% of AdobeRGB, and 100% of DCI-P3. Colors are also incredibly accurate, at a DeltaE of 0.64 (less than 1.0 can’t be distinguished by the human eye). Blacks are perfect, and the contrast is incredibly deep. The new panel runs at up to 120Hz, dynamically switched, and that’s better than the previous generation’s 90Hz.
You’ll love this display for productivity work, creativity, and consuming media. OLED remains a significant upgrade from IPS panels, and it’s cheaper than ever to buy.
Audio quality wasn’t as great. Two downward-firing speakers demonstrated a ton of distortion at high volume levels, and by the time you turned the speakers down low enough to get rid of the distortion, they were too quiet. Mids and highs were OK, but the bass was nonexistent. You’ll definitely want a pair of headphones or an external Bluetooth speaker for anything other than system sounds.
Another excellent 14-inch OLED value, if you buy from the right place I was almost done writing this review when HP sent me a link to buy my review configuration for just $900 at Costco (for members). I was going to give it a lower rating and a lesser review at the HP.com price of $1,230, so I had to scramble to update the review accordingly.
At the Costco price, even for non-members, the 2023 Pavilion Plus 14 is another great value. You get excellent performance, a good enough build, and a gorgeous OLED display for under $1,000. The Asus Zenbook 14X OLED and Zenbook 14 OLED both still remain strong competitors, but you should absolutely consider the Pavilion Plus 14 before making your buying decision.

You might be surprised This midrange HP laptop beats the Dell XPS 15 in one important way The best laptops under $1,000 you can buy right now Laptop Reviews Laptops Product Reviews Windows Reviews Computing HP is consistently one of the best laptop brands. It’s been around for decades as a company and always seems to put together a quality yet affordable computer. Its Envy lineup of laptops is among its most popular laptop models. The Envy lineup is its high-end consumer-oriented laptop, but that’s no reason to think you can’t find one in your price range. If you aren’t certain an Envy is the best HP model for you, you can compare the HP Envy and Pavilion lineups. But if an HP Envy feels right, there are several great HP Envy laptop deals taking place right now, and we’ve tracked them all down.
HP Envy x360 2-in-1 laptop 15Z-FH000 — $600, was $900 The HP Envy x360 convertible laptop is a great option for just about anyone, particularly anyone who enjoys the touchscreen functionality of a tablet. It’s well designed and super slim, making it a truly go-anywhere device. Despite its portability, it still has an immersive 15.6-inch touchscreen that’s great for creators, note-takers, and binge watchers. Top notch build quality and durability, fast charging technology, a fingerprint reader, and great battery life round out the top features of the HP Envy x360 convertible touchscreen laptop. It competes well with the best 2-in-1 laptops. Its versatility and all-around capability make it a worthy companion on any desk, and on any lap.
Computing The least expensive MacBook you can buy remains the MacBook Air M1, which Apple is keeping around in spite of a complete redesign with the MacBook Air M2. And there's good reason. The MacBook Air M1 is among the best laptops that sell for under $1,000.
But it's not the only great laptop for under $1,000. The Asus ZenBook 14 OLED is also a special machine, offering considerable value at a starting price of $700, including a luscious OLED display. As good as the MacBook Air is, the ZenBook 14 just might have it beat.
Specs Computing HP has been well-known in the PC gaming space for its Omen brand, but the company hasn't had a flagship gaming laptop that felt like it could keep up with the Razers and Alienwares of the world. But the newly announced Omen Transcend 16 is just that.
Not only is it thinner and lighter than the standard Omen 16 (0.78 inches thick and 4.6 pounds), but it's also more advanced in almost every way. The highlight of the show is the new mini-LED panel. We saw a lot of these same mini-LED panels introduced at gaming laptops at CES earlier this year, and HP continues the trend by bringing it to the Omen Transcend 16.
