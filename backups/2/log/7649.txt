Why trust us? 3 underrated sci-fi movies on Amazon Freevee you should watch in October By Christine Persaud Close Amazon Freevee is a service you can watch even without an Amazon Prime subscription. It’s totally free but with ads between movies and TV show episodes. That’s a small price to pay for being able to watch so much great content.
Triangle Killer Klowns From Outer Space Black Box Sci-fi is the type of genre that often touches on other genres, like drama, comedy, action, and psychological horror. You can check out the best sci-fi movies on Amazon Prime Video.
 But the selection of content on Amazon Freevee, including sci-fi movies, is worth exploring, too. If sci-fi is what you’re in the mood for right now, we have put together this list of 3 underrated sci-fi movies on Amazon Freevee you should watch in October. You might never even have heard of these films before, but you’ll find them intriguing, entertaining, and thought-provoking.
Triangle In this British-Australian sci-fi film, which gears towards the psychological horror side, Melissa George stars as a woman preparing to take her autistic son with her on a boat trip with a friend named Greg (Michael Dorman). But as they set sea, a troubling call comes in from a woman who claims to be witnessing someone killing people. The boat capsizes and the survivors end up on an ocean liner.
The best movies on Amazon Prime Video (November 2023) 3 TV shows on Tubi you should watch in November 7 best sci-fi movie actors Strange things begin to happen, including visions of a mysterious silhouette.
Triangle , which also stars Liam Hemsworth, has been lauded for being intelligent and well-acted. But it never received a theatrical release in the U.S., making it a movie that has likely never been on your radar, until now.
Stream Triangle on Amazon Freevee.
Killer Klowns From Outer Space Sci-fi horror movies from the ‘80s didn’t rely on complex special effects: the films were much simpler yet could still make your skin crawl.
Killer Klowns From Outer Space skews to the comedic side, the story of evil aliens who happen to look like clowns. When they invade a small town with the intent of harvesting humans and drinking their blood, insanity and hilarity ensue.
The movie is the only ever from the Chiodo Brothers who predominantly work behind the scenes in special effects, stop-motion, and Claymation.
Killer Klowns From Outer Space is campy and fun. It has since become a cult classic but remains a goofy movie not everyone is aware even exists.
Stream Killer Klowns From Outer Space on Amazon Freevee.
Black Box A Prime Video original, Black Box stars Mamoudou Athie as Nolan, a man suffering from amnesia after a devastating car crash. Now a single father since his wife died in the crash, Nolan decides to undergo an experimental procedure called “black box,” desperate to make his memories return.
But the procedure results in Nolan seeing a monster every time he tries to access a memory and a battle between a man and a strange figure taking over his consciousness. Having received decent reviews, Black Box is mind-boggling and thought-provoking. Phylicia Rashad also stars as Dr. Lilian Brooks, the woman administering the controversial treatment.

This month, our picks include Tom Cruise in a film unlike any of his previous blockbusters, as well as a cult classic robots-versus-aliens movie, and the final installment of a cult-classic film trilogy. These are the three sci-fi movies on Hulu that you need to watch in November.
Edge of Tomorrow (2014) Entertainment Action movies can get you amped up for a big day to come, or even out of a bad mood. They often feature high-speed chases, intense fight scenes, and maybe even a bit of sci-fi. They can be set just about anywhere and usually include great fight choreography and/or visual effects, sometimes even thought-provoking storylines when you dig deeper beneath the surface.
The best action movies on Prime Video include a diverse mix of titles, both old and new. When it comes to three action movies on Prime Video you need to watch in November, they all include A-list casts and one even spawned a franchise that is going strong after two decades.
V For Vendetta (2006) V For Vendetta (2005) Official Trailer #1 - Sc-Fi Thriller HD Entertainment Amazon Prime Video original series Upload could not have come at a better time. As artificial intelligence (AI) technology, robots, virtual reality, and other high-tech innovations dominate the conversation in real life, Upload provides an interesting, albeit parodied version of what the future could look like, not just for the living, but for the dead as well.
When the second season ended, Nathan (Robbie Amell) managed to move his consciousness from the Lakeview digital afterlife into a clone body to navigate the real world. The reason? To investigate details about his death, which he now knows was at the hands of deceased (and uploaded) billionaire David Choak (William B. Davis). The third season of the Amazon Prime Video original series picks up right where fans left off.
