How to add Arlo cameras to Apple HomeKit Best Arlo Black Friday deals: Save on security cameras and bundles Arlo Essential 2nd Gen vs. Arlo Pro 4: is the Arlo Pro 4 worth it? Step 3: Here, you’ll see a screenshot of what your camera is recording. If the image looks old, press the Update Photo button to refresh it.
Step 4: You should see a grid overlay running the length of your image. Tapping on a square in the grid will turn it into an inactive Activity Zone – meaning motion will not be detected in that region.
Step 5: Depending on your camera, you may be able to zoom in on the image to access a smaller grid. This allows you to create a more precise Activity Zone.
Step 6: Once you’ve tapped on the areas you’d like your camera to ignore, select Done.
Step 7: Any motion in the squares you deactivated will be ignored. All the squares that remain are considered your Activity Zone.
Step 8: If you’d like to delete all your changes and start from scratch, you can select the Reset Zones button to activate all squares on the grid.
Step 9: It requires some trial and error to get your Activity Zones working flawlessly for your property. Consider making minor changes to your settings every 24 hours until you've perfected its layout.
