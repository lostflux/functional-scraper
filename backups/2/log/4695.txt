They’re super-responsive, brimming with high-tech, and better for the environment. But they’re still relatively new, and new ones are still relatively expensive. As a result, you may be wondering how you can get your hands on a used EV.
Tesla Model 3 Kia Soul EV Nissan Leaf BMW i3 Chevrolet Bolt EV Volkswagen e-Golf But buying a used EV can be a little daunting. After all, given how quickly electric cars are improving, you might want to make sure you’re really getting an EV that will last more than a year or two. That’s why we’ve put together this guide on the best used EVs.
Tesla Model 3 Tesla / Tesla The Tesla Model 3 is an excellent choice for a used EV due to its durability and long-lasting performance. Over time, the Model 3 has proven to retain its value better than most other EVs on the market, thanks to the longevity of its battery and electric powertrain. Tesla’s batteries are known to degrade slowly (while some others can degrade quicker), with many Model 3 owners reporting that they maintain a high percentage of their original capacity even after years of use. This means that potential buyers can expect a used Model 3 to still provide considerable driving range and reliability, making it a sound investment.

This means that a used Model 3 can still offer a cutting-edge driving experience, comparable to newer models.

Editors' Recommendations Best electric car charger deals: $100 off home charging stations The best used car websites in 2023 Pros and cons of buying a used electric car How do electric cars work? EV motors and batteries explained Tesla’s electric cars get second price bump in a month Cars Spending more than you need to on a car, when there are plenty of reliable and fun used cars under $15,000, is unnecessary.
By factoring in the reliability of different brands and their true market value, this best-used cars' list was born. Don’t worry about high mileage, either, as these cars price below $15,000 according to the Edmunds True Market Value and have less than 50,000 miles. From there, we looked at Consumer Reports reliability scores to see how these cars are likely to hold up in daily use. Finally, we considered factors like safety, performance, practicality, and style to see which cars were genuinely worth buying. The 2016 Mazda 3 made it to the top of our list since affordable and offers enough style and sensibility. From fuel-efficient sedans to burly SUVs, this list provides a bit of everything.
Cars As the first mass-produced electric car with more than 200 miles of range and a price below $40,000, the first-generation Chevrolet Bolt EV was a giant leap toward a zero-emission future. Chevy can't rest on its laurels, though. With rivals launching their own mass-market electric cars—encouraged by stricter global emissions standards—the Bolt EV was in need of an update.
General Motors didn't just update the Bolt EV, though, it added a new SUV-like variant alongside the existing hatchback. The 2022 Chevrolet Bolt EUV will go on sale alongside the 2022 Chevrolet Bolt EV this summer. The Bolt EUV is also the first non-Cadillac model to get GM's Super Cruise driver-assist tech, while the Bolt EV gets a restyling inside and out.
Cars Motorists are spending more than ever on a new car, but that doesn't mean you need to take out a second mortgage to commute in a reliable, comfortable, and stylish car. Used cars are longer-lasting than they've ever been -- which partly explains why the average car on American roads is nearly 12 years old -- so you'll enjoy worry-free trips if you find a good one. We've picked out six good options that are relatively easy to find for under $10,000.
