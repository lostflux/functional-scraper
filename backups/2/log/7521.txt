Cordina (16-0, 9 KOs) had previously held the title, lost it by not defending due to a hand injury, then regained it in April in a bloody fight against Shavkatdzhon Rakhimov that at the time was considered a candidate for for Fight of the Year.

Saul "Canelo" Alvarez (59-2-2, 39 KOs) is defending all four of his belts against Jermell Charlo (35-1-1, 19 KOs) in a Premier Boxing Champions fight card. This is Canelo's third fight since his loss to Dmitrii Bivol in May of 2022. Charlo's last actual fight was that same month, so he's coming out of quite a layoff. Charlo is also an undisputed champion -- he has all four super welterweight belts -- but only Canelo's titles are on the line in this fight.
Saul "Canelo" Alvarez vs. Jermell Charlo will start on Saturday, September 30 at 8:00 p.m. ET. It's a PPV event on Showtime, and there are some exciting undercard fights leading up to the main event. Here's everything you need to know to watch boxing online this weekend.
Entertainment (ESPN/Top Rank Boxing) Image used with permission by copyright holder The Real Big Baby has his headline debut tonight. Jared "The Real Big Baby" Anderson (14-0, 14KOs) will take on former title holder Charles Martin (29-3-1, 26 KOs) in a heavyweight bout in Toledo, Ohio. Both of these fighters are heavy sluggers. Anderson has a perfect knockout record, and 12 of his 14 knockouts have come in the third round or earlier. Charles Martin has a similarly KO-heavy record. Even though this fight is only scheduled for ten rounds, very few people expect it to go past five.
Entertainment (DAZN) Image used with permission by copyright holder Fight fans are in for a brutal battle tonight. Edgar Berlanga (20-0, 16 KOs) faces Jason Quigley (20-2, 14 KOs) in a match that is unlikely to go the distance. Berlanga is the heavy favorite for the night. Considering the history of both fighters, there will likely be fireworks.
