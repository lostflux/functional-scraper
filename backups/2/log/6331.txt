Why trust us? iRobot expands Roomba 2-in-1 lineup with Combo j5+ and Combo i5+ By Jon Bitner Close The Roomba Combo j7+ is getting two new family members, as iRobot is expanding its lineup of robot vacuum and mops with the Combo j5+ and Combo i5+. Both devices are now up for preorder, with an expected launch date of September 3.
Unlike the expensive Combo j7+, the Combo j5+ and Combo i5+ are lower-priced options that offer many of the same features. The j5+ is a particular standout, allowing you to swap between vacuuming and mopping to just vacuuming by switching out its bin. Its charging dock can hold up to 60 days of debris before it needs to be manually emptied, and the robot itself boasts AI that can identify cords, shoes, and other hazards scattered throughout your home.
iRobot The Roomba Combo j5+ Robot Vacuum and Mop costs $800, which is pretty pricey for a robot vacuum. Compared to the $1,000 j7+, however, it could be a great option if you need something that’ll both mop and vacuum and want to save a few bucks.
The biggest departure from the j7+ is you’ll need to swap out bins on the j5+. The j7+ uses a swinging arm to automatically stow away its mop when traveling on carpet.
iRobot Meanwhile, the Combo i5+ is designed for smaller homes without much carpet. It also shares the same bin-swapping design as the Combo j5+, along with a docking station capable of holding 60 days of debris. The main drawback is that it’s not quite as smart as the j5+ and won’t be able to detect obstacles in your home.
Its reduced navigational prowess makes it quite a bit cheaper, as the Combo i5+ is just $500. But since it can vacuum and mop, it’s still a great companion for most homes. You may want to steer clear of it if you have pets, however, as it won’t be able to detect any toys (or other gifts) they could drop in your living room.

Editors' Recommendations Cordless vs. robot vacuums: which one should you buy? How to fix a robot vacuum that stops moving iRobot Roomba Combo j9+ vs. Roomba Combo j7+: which is the best robot vacuum? SwitchBot S10 robot vacuum connects to your plumbing for fully automated mopping Eufy’s new X9 Pro Robovac offers automated mopping and vacuuming for less than $1,000 Appliances Robot Vacuums Tech News Smart Home It seems like Ecovacs only just launched the Deebot T10 Omni, but the company is already gearing up for another massive product launch. On June 13, the Ecovacs Deebot T20 Omni will hit the markets, bringing with it a bunch of new skills -- including the ability to raise its mop while traveling on carpet and an automated mop-washing station that uses hot water to prevent the buildup of bacteria.
The ability to lift its mopping plates 9mm off the ground is a big selling point of the T20 Omni. In fact, no other robot vacuum can lift their mop higher -- unless, of course, you count the j7+ Combo, which completely changes the orientation of its mophead to ensure it doesn’t brush along your carpet. But no matter how you cut it, the 9mm of travel distance for the mophead is a big improvement for the T20 Omni.
Smart Home Robot vacuums have come a long way over the past few years. What started out as a niche device prone to falling down the stairs or getting tangled in pet toys is now able to keep your floors clean for weeks on end without any manual input. They come in all shapes, sizes, and budgets -- but if you’re looking to get the most for your money, you need to spring for a premium model that knows how to automatically empty its dustbin.
Some robot vacuums are more headache than helper The appeal of robot vacuums is simple. Instead of having to vacuum your home every few days, these circular little monsters can suck up debris, pet fur, dirt, and everything else lurking in your carpets without the need to dirty your hands.
Smart Home The Roomba j7 and j7+ are two of the best robot vacuums on the market, and if you opt into a fairly new beta, they only become more enticing. When signing up for the Remote Check-In beta, you’ll get to use your robot vacuum as a makeshift security camera -- allowing you to “check in” on your home while you're away.
The company opened the feature to select owners in November, but the company is just now rolling it out to a larger audience. In fact, if you have a Roomba j7 or j7+ at home, there’s a good chance you received a notification from your companion smartphone app telling you about the service. There are still some serious limitations to the beta (it only works with iOS devices and is supported by just a handful of products in the j7 lineup), but if you get the notification, there’s no harm in checking out the cool new feature.
