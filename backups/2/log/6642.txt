Why trust us? Samsung takes on TCL with 98-inch 4K TV that costs just $8,000 By Simon Cohen Close Samsung In May, TCL stunned us with the price of its new Q Class QM8 98-inch TV.
 At a mere $10,000, it was far less than the cheapest comparable model from Samsung. Today, Samsung is answering that challenge with an impressively low-priced 98-inch model of its own: the , which will be available starting in July for $8,000.
Samsung is keen to start moving these behemoth screens as soon as possible, so it’s got two launch promotions to entice buyers. Starting today through July 2, if you reserve the 98-inch Q80C on Samsung.com or at participating retailers, you’ll get a $500 credit that can be used to purchase the TV during the early order period.
That early order period runs from July 3 through July 23. If you go through with the purchase during this period, Samsung will give you an additional $1,000 off the price, it will throw in a $1,000 Samsung Q800C soundbar , and it will give you free delivery and installation. To recap: that’s the 98-i nch Q80C and the Q800C soundbar, delivered and installed, for $6,500.
The hidden costs of buying a 4K TV are way higher than you think Mini-LED vs. QLED TV: how one technology is improving the other Hisense just debuted the world’s largest mini-LED TV at 100 inches It’s worth noting that the Q80C isn’t as tricked-out as Samsung’s flagship Neo QLED models or the TCL QM8. The biggest difference is how these TVs are backlit. Samsung’s Neo QLED and TCL’s QM8 use a mini-LED backlight — thousands of tiny LED lights that are divided into hundreds of control zones. The Q80C, while still a quantum dot model, uses conventionally sized LEDs with full-array local dimming (FALD), so brightness and black levels may not be quite as good.
Still, the Q80C isn’t shy on features. For starters, it gets Samsung’s Neural Quantum Processor 4K , which delivers a number of picture enhancements, including very good upscaling of non-4K content. It also supports adaptive HDR10+ , which can adjust the brightness and intensity of HDR content based on the ambient lighting conditions in your room, and it’s compatible with Dolby Atmos for immersive, 3D sound.
The giant screen should also be a great canvas for gaming. Like the rest of Samsung’s 2023 lineup, you get access to Samsung Gaming Hub, an all-in-one platform with 3,000 games from Xbox, Nvidia GeForce NOW, Amazon Luna, Utomik, Antstream Arcade, and Blacknut — all of which are streamed from the cloud, so no console required.
The TV has auto low-latency mode (ALLM) and support for 4K at 120Hz over HDMI 2.1.
 However, PC gamers should note that this model doesn’t do variable refresh rate (VRR).
We feel like TCL might have gotten wind of Samsung’s news. When we checked Best Buy, we couldn’t help noticing that the has been reduced from $8,500 to $5,000. So if you’re in the market for a monster TV, you now have some serious thinking to do before you make your selection.
Editors' Recommendations Hisense teases 110-inch, 10,000-nit TV ahead of CES 2024 Vizio’s new Quantum 4K QLED TVs hit 75 inches for $699 YouTube TV in 4K: Everything you need to know Samsung’s biggest Neo QLED 8K TV comes with an equally huge price Samsung scales its Terrace outdoor TV to 85 inches with mini-LEDs Samsung Tech News TV Audio / Video TCL has unveiled yet another 98-inch 4K TV: the S Class S5 (98S550G), which can be preordered starting August 24 for $5,000. As part of TCL's partnership with the NFL, the company is also offering football fans $200 off NFL Sunday Ticket from YouTube and YouTube TV if you buy the TV before September 19, 2023.
The Google TV-powered 98-inch S5 joins TCL's $5,000 98-inch Class XL 4K QLED TV (98R754) and the company's $12,000 98-inch Q Class mini-LED 4K TV (98QM850G) as the three biggest TCL TVs.
Audio / Video Why wait for a new product to go on sale when you grab a huge discount on day one? That's clearly the thinking behind Hisense's retail launch of its 2023 U8K mini-LED 4K TV, which arrives in stores today. The flagship TV is available in 55-, 65-, and 75-inch screen sizes. Normally, these are priced at $1,300, $1,700, and $2,300 respectively, but for a limited time, Hisense has dramatically reduced all three, which are currently at $800, $1,100, and $1,600.
U8K is the company's flagship TV and marries the impressive benefits of quantum dots with the precise brightness control of mini-LED backlighting. The U8K offers Hisense's best and brightest picture quality -- that is, until (and if) Hisense releases the UX TV it teased at CES 2023. And it's loaded with features that will make it a strong contender if you're looking for a great TV without spending a fortune.
Audio / Video TCL has finally revealed its full lineup of TVs for 2023, and it includes a new flagship that is sure to give Samsung and Sony some sleepless nights. The 98-inch QM8 isn't TCL's first 98-inch TV, and it isn't the first 98-inch TV to sell for $10,000 or less, but it is the first mini-LED-powered 98-inch TV to sell for such a low price. Samsung's only 98-inch 4K, mini-LED TV -- the excellent QN90A -- costs 50% more at $15,000. Even the 85-inch model, at $2,800 is surprisingly affordable compared to similar mini-LED TVs.
