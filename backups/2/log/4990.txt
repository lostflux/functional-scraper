First announced in 2020, trailers starring Vin Diesel (yes, you read that correctly) describe a war in the past that led to the state of the world being a mashup of prehistoric animals and futuristic technologies. We think it’s safe to assume that gameplay will be very similar to the first game — you’ll explore with friends, raise dinosaurs, hunt dinosaurs, be hunted by dinosaurs, and try to build a safe settlement in a harsh world. This game has been pushed back to late 2024, but we could see it slipping into 2025.

Originally relatively cheap at just $830, a $270 discount from HP pulls its price down further to only $560. We're not sure how long stocks will remain available, and once the offer is gone, we're not sure when you'll get another crack at it. If you want to enjoy savings when buying this gaming desktop, you're going to have to complete your purchase as soon as possible.
Why you should buy the HP Victus 15L gaming PC It's not going to challenge the best gaming PCs in terms of performance, but the HP Victus 15L is capable of running the best PC games with its 12th-generation Intel Core i5 processor, Intel Arc A380 Graphics, and 8GB of RAM. You may have to downgrade to the lowest graphics settings for the more demanding titles, and you're going to want to upgrade to 16GB of RAM as soon as you can just to give the computer's memory a bit more breathing room, but as it stands, the HP Victus 15L is still a worthwhile purchase as a low-cost gaming desktop.
Computing Gamers should be extra careful when looking at gaming PC deals, as some cheap machines won't be able to meet the requirements of today's video games. That's certainly not the case with the powerful Alienware Aurora R15 though, which is available from Dell with a $400 discount that slashes its price from $2,000 to $1,600. It's not exactly affordable, but you should be ready to make a significant investment if you want a reliable gaming desktop like this one. You'll have to hurry with your purchase though, as we're not sure how much time remains before the savings are taken offline.
Why you should buy the Alienware Aurora R15 gaming PC The Alienware Aurora R15 challenges the performance of the best gaming PCs with its 13th-generation Intel Core i7 processor, Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 Ti graphics card, and 16GB of RAM that's the recommended number by our guide on everything you need to build a gaming PC. Not only will you have no trouble playing the best PC games with these specifications, but you'll also be prepared for the best upcoming PC games. However, when you eventually need upgrades, it will be easy to swap the components of the Alienware Aurora R15 gaming PC.
