When the evil Arcane Order awakens the ancient Titans, the heroes of Arcadia must band together to put an end to the wretched reign of their mutual enemy. An action-packed spectacle, Rise of the Titans serves as a fitting end to del Toro’s expansive universe of trolls, extraterrestrials, and powerful wizards. Think of it as the animated little brother to Marvel’s The Avengers , an amalgamation of benevolent world-savers facing off against adversaries, and a battle that necessitates teamwork of fantastical proportions.
