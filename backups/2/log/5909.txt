The original Xbox launched with lackluster exclusives, like Blinx: The Time Sweeper and Fuzion Frenzy , that wouldn’t have given players much of a reason to pick the console up — if it weren’t for Halo: Combat Evolved.
 The original game spawned countless books, toys, television series, and, of course, sequels.
Nowadays, most of the Halo games — not counting the spinoffs — can be found in an optimized form on the Master Chief Collection. For this list, however, we’re judging them as they were when they first launched, and we’re not counting re-releases like Halo: CE Anniversary or Halo 2 Anniversary as distinct entries.
With 13 different games split across multiple genres, there’s a whole world of games to (re-)experience now that Halo Infinite has launched. Here are all the Halo games ranked from best to worst to help you decide which games to play and which to avoid like a plague of Flood.

The maps look even more impressive in high resolution on a 4K 130-inch screen than previous Halo missions, but their layout is similar. Much like in earlier Halo game versions, you’ll be fighting classic Flood and Covenant baddies as you meet characters like Captain Keyes and Master Chief.
Unfortunately, the short-lived experience is unnecessarily challenging. You can’t hide to reload during battles, and the pistol and shotgun are weaker than they were in the original game. The graphics have improved, though.
You can play these six campaigns in about an hour, and it will cost you anywhere from $20 to $30, depending on the arcade where you’re playing. Holding a physical gun and killing Covenant “in person” are novel perks that hardcore fans will love. Plus, you can scan a QR code to compare your score with others on Halo Waypoint once you finish your game.

Fully embracing the RPG elements, Modern Warfare 3 once again allows you to earn XP as you play match after match to rank up your character, with each rank not only bringing you closer to hitting prestige but also unlocking new options for your chosen operator. Your player rank is unique from your weapon levels and can take a lot longer to grind if you don't know the most efficient methods. If you want to fast-track your career through the ranks, here are the fastest ways to earn XP in Modern Warfare 3.
How to earn XP fast in Modern Warfare 3 There's basically no way you can play Modern Warfare 3 without earning XP, but some modes and methods can earn you double (or more) what you could if you were just playing without a plan.
Play the objective We all love playing team deathmatch or any other mode where all you need to worry about is being the one to shoot first. However, if you want to earn that sweet XP fast, you need to choose one of the objective modes like Domination, Hardpoint, Ground War, or even Kill Confirmed. Not only do you get XP for killing enemies, but the amount you get on top of that for playing the objective can make up the bulk of your XP gain. This is especially true if you're not at the top of your game and end up dying more than you kill since you have another method to contribute. Also, objective modes grant you an XP bonus just for finishing the match.
Always work towards daily and weapon challenges Gaming While the jumps have been getting smaller and smaller between generations, there's always a nice graphical bump to look forward to when picking up the latest hardware. We're long past the days of going from 16-bit 2D games to full-on 3D, and even the jump from SD to HD, but the visual improvements we got between the PS4 and PS5 are still striking. Not only are resolutions higher, but new techniques like ray tracing are now possible and starting to show up in more titles as we get deeper into the console's life.
Now that it's been out for a decent amount of time, and we have a wide selection of both upgraded titles and ones made exclusively for the PS5, there are a few that have risen to the top that anyone looking to show off the power of their new console will want to grab. Not only are all the games on this list visually impressive -- not just necessarily photorealistic, mind you -- but they're also a blast to play. Graphics don't make a game fun, but it just works out that the best-looking games on PS5 are also some of the best-playing. Here are our picks for the PS5 games with the best graphics.
