Home Entertainment News YouTube tries new way of tackling ad blockers By Trevor Mogg Close YouTube could be about to launch a widespread crackdown on folks using ad blockers.
Reports emerged last month that YouTube was deploying pop-ups to warn against the use of ad-blocking tools. But now it’s taking the action one step further.
A revised notice says that an ad blocker has been detected, but now warns that the video player will stop functioning after three video streams unless the user adjusts the ad blocker’s settings to allow YouTube ads, or disables the ad blocker entirely.
I couldn’t live without this simple desktop YouTube feature YouTube rolling out some three-dozen new features this fall YouTube Premium and YouTube Music are now more expensive, too Alternatively, YouTube says, users can go ad-free by joining YouTube Premium , which costs $12 per month or $120 per year.
In a widely reported statement, YouTube confirmed that it’s carrying out a “small experiment globally” that prompts users to adjust their ad blocker’s settings or sign up for the streaming site’s premium tier.
Anyone who receives the notice but isn’t using an ad blocker should click on the “report issue” link at the bottom.
In-stream ads are at the heart of YouTube’s operation. Indeed, its notice also says that “ads allow YouTube to stay free for billions of users worldwide.” Android Authority, which first reported what could be the beginning of a widespread crackdown on those using ad blockers, noted how the Google-owned company forced the closure of popular third-party app YouTube Vanced last year.
YouTube Vanced functioned as a modified version of the actual YouTube app, offering features that included ad-free playback. The company behind the app was sent a cease-and-desist letter that forced it to stop developing and distributing the software.
YouTube is always tweaking the way it presents ads, including the length and the ability — or not — to skip. Last month, it announced it was launching unskippable TV ads that run for 30 seconds, double the usual length. The ads are most likely to appear with content that’s proved popular on the platform.
Digital Trends has reached to YouTube out for more information on its attempt to tackle ad blocking and we will update this article when we hear back.
Editors' Recommendations YouTube’s enhanced 1080p video now available on more devices YouTube NFL outage: Should Google give refunds or credits? YouTube with a blank home screen is a beautiful place YouTube TV password sharing — is that even a thing? YouTube TV adds Magnolia Network and other FAST channels Computing Tech News YouTube Computing Being popular is about the only thing the current most-viewed YouTube videos have in common with their top-performing predecessors. Even though YouTube videos like Chocolate Rain went viral during the first few years of YouTube's content, they probably wouldn't be among the kinds of videos that go viral on the platform now.
In fact, children's programming and music videos are now among the most-viewed content on YouTube. Music videos, in particular, have enjoyed great success on the streaming site and, until recently, had been the majority of the most-viewed videos in YouTube's history. Music videos still account for 40% of the top 10 most-viewed videos, however. The other 60% is content for young children. If these view counts are anything to go by, the video-sharing site could be considered a leading platform for music videos and kid-friendly content, rather than just the memeworthy viral videos the site was known for in its early days.
What is the most-viewed YouTube video of all time? Baby Shark Dance is the most-viewed video ever on YouTube. The children's song overtook the all-Spanish version of Despacito in November 2020.
What are the top 10 most-viewed YouTube videos? Audio / Video When you think of streaming video, you think YouTube. And so YouTube TV — Google's live TV streaming service — very much just makes sense for a lot of people. Designed for those who want to cut the cord and ditch their cable or satellite subscriptions (and known in the industry as a multichannel video programming distributor, or MPVD), YouTube TV competes in the same arena as other streaming television services like DirecTV Stream (formerly known as AT&T TV Now and DirecTV Now), Sling TV, FuboTV, and Hulu With Live TV.
And YouTube TV offers a unique mix of features that make it very appealing, so much so that it's now the No. 1 service in the U.S. in terms of the number of paid subscribers, with some 5 million subscribers as of June 2022 — up some 2 million from the last time the service gave an update in October 2020. The popularity is due to several factors. YouTube TV is easy to use. It's got a selection of channels that's competitive with all its rivals. And the YouTube TV price is competitive, too. You're able to watch YouTube TV on pretty much any modern device. And the fact that parent company Alphabet (aka Google) has been marketing the heck out of it the past few years certainly hasn't hurt, either.
Entertainment If you're thinking of cutting the cable cord, it's never been a better time, and networking and streaming giants are falling all over themselves to provide the best alternatives for live TV streaming. From Hulu with Live TV to Sling TV to YouTube TV, there are a number of ways to watch televised events live or catch up on your favorite network shows without paying for cable.
Each of these services has its own price tag and list of special features to stand out from one another. However, differentiating between them as a consumer can feel overwhelming. We’ve done our best to simplify the shopping process for you and explain the best live TV streaming services available today.
