Close Image used with permission by copyright holder It seems like it was yesterday we were looking at life through 1990s pop culture references in Netflix’s Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. Now Netflix has decided to renew the absurd adventures of its titular heroine for its fourth season.
The renewal comes less than a month after the third season premiered. Its timing also comes after Netflix canceled drama series Bloodline and Sense8.
The series has gained popularity for its relentless barrage of jokes that sometimes are too smart for their own good. “I’ve Googled jokes before, that I don’t get, and even Google sometimes doesn’t have the answer for me,” actress Ellie Kemper said in a 2016 interview with NPR.
We first got introduced to Schmidt and her bunker tales in March 2015 and have been tuned in ever since. Given the fact Orange is the New Black is getting nominated for Emmys as a drama series, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt will become one of the longest running original comedy series for Netflix. Only Grace and Frankie , which was also renewed for a fourth season, will have as many seasons. Including those two series, only nine Netflix original programs have ever made it to four seasons.

This season featured Titus Andromedon introducing “lemonade’ing” into the national lexicon, Schmidt battling a robot to become a crossing guard, and the Washington Redskins having their name changed.
Trying to find out how many people watch Netflix shows is mostly an act of futility. But, the few studies that have gleaned some viewership data from Netflix has shown Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt is one of the most watched Netflix original programs. No release date for the new season has been set yet. But, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt ‘s last three seasons have all debuted between March andMay, so it may be safe to expect the gang to return for spring 2018.
Editors' Recommendations The 10 most popular TV shows on Netflix right now How much is Apple TV+? 3 movies leaving Netflix by September 1 you should watch New My Netflix tab looks to make streaming on the go a bit easier Watch these 5 movies and TV shows before they leave Netflix in March News Netflix Streaming Services Tech News Entertainment For three seasons of Netflix psychological thriller You, fans watched the eerily charming Joe Goldberg (Penn Badgley) rationalize his heinous actions through a twisted internal monologue. His killings were gruesome and obsessive behavior terrifying, made worse by his warped justifications for everything he did. He was merely stalking each woman to protect her; it’s how he shows he cares, after all. He’s truly sorry for every murder, but he really had no other option.
In season 4, however, the tables have turned on Joe. Streaming's favorite hunter has now become the prey, with a new serial killer stalking Joe and seemingly getting away with murder. In the process, Joe encounters an embodiment of the thing that he most fears: himself.
Entertainment You, one of the best shows on Netflix, commenced its fourth season with the first five episodes on February 9 and the remaining five set for release on March 9. Now that Joe (Penn Badgley) is going by the name Jonathan and working as a professor in London, he is reluctantly making new friends. Once again, something about Joe draws people in the upper echelon of society to him, even when he doesn't quite fit in.
The newly introduced characters are mostly snobby, elitist spoiled rich kids who make up for what they lack in talent and drive with ample bank accounts. Each comes from a wealthy family and most of them haven’t had to work a day in their lives. Joe resents them for it, revolted by every conversation. But there’s no denying they make for good television. Interestingly, many of the best new characters in You are just as awful as Joe, but in different ways.
6. Simon Entertainment When we left Joe Goldberg at the end of season 3 of the hit Netflix series You, he was in an explosive situation, literally. He had killed his wife, Love, set his house on fire, and cut off his own toes to suggest he had perished in the blaze. Joe was determined to turn his life around, especially after running into Marienne and seeing the terror on her face over who he was and what he had done. He then escaped to start anew in a different country.
In season 4, it’s revealed that Joe headed to Paris in search of the woman he believed he was meant to be with, Marienne. That led him to London, where he assumed the new identity of a man named Jonathan and began working as a professor teaching a literature class.
