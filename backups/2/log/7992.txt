Read less Get Out (2017) 104m Mystery, Thriller, Horror Daniel Kaluuya, Allison Williams, Bradley Whitford Jordan Peele watch on Netflix watch on Netflix Nope ‘s Jordan Peele won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay for his 2017 psychological horror film Get Out.
 The plot centers on a Black man who uncovers shocking truths while visiting the wealthy family of his white girlfriend. Thrilling, morbidly funny, and full of clever social commentary, Get Out is a stunning debut for Peele. The film features a brilliant, Oscar-nominated turn from Daniel Kaluuya and an equally impressive supporting cast, including the ever-underrated Allison Williams.
Read less Us (2019) 116m Horror, Thriller, Mystery Lupita Nyong'o, Winston Duke, Shahadi Wright Joseph Jordan Peele watch on Netflix watch on Netflix Peele’s sophomore effort, the 2019 psychological horror film Us , stars Oscar winner Lupita Nyong’o as a young mother whose family is attacked by mysterious strangers while on a holiday. Nyong’o delivers a tour de force that was unjustly snubbed by the Academy, while Peele’s screenplay offers more of the thought-provoking thrills that made Get Out a smashing success.
Us might’ve not been as acclaimed as its predecessor, but it’s just as clever and insightful, cementing Peele as a force to be reckoned with in the horror space.
Read less The Strangers (2008) 86m Horror, Mystery, Thriller Liv Tyler, Scott Speedman, Gemma Ward Bryan Bertino watch on Netflix watch on Netflix Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman star in the 2008 horror thriller The Strangers.
 The film follows a couple fighting for their lives against three masked attackers while at their vacation home. Featuring three genuinely unsettling antagonists, two compelling performances from Tyler and Speedman, and a screenplay full of unanswered questions, The Strangers is among the most disturbing horror films from the 2010s. The film understands there’s nothing scarier than the unknown and wraps its villains in a cloak of mystery that makes them all the more haunting.
Read less Vivarium (2019) 97m Science Fiction, Thriller, Mystery, Horror Imogen Poots, Jesse Eisenberg, Jonathan Aris Lorcan Finnegan watch on Netflix watch on Netflix Academy Award nominee Jesse Eisenberg stars opposite Imogen Poots in the 2019 horror film Vivarium.
 It tells the story of a couple trapped within the maze-like houses of a seemingly idyllic suburban neighborhood that hides chilling secrets. Stylish and clever albeit slightly frustrating, Vivarium ‘s lofty ambitions might be too much for some viewers. However, a pair of committed leading performances and an intelligent screenplay unafraid to challenge and disturb are enough to elevate this sci-fi horror to new and terrifying heights.
Read less Mr. Harrigan's Phone (2022) 105m Drama, Thriller, Horror, Mystery Donald Sutherland, Jaeden Martell, Kirby Howell-Baptiste John Lee Hancock watch on Netflix watch on Netflix Slowly but surely, Jaeden Martell has become a modern scream king through his consistent contributions to the horror genre.
John Lee Hancock’s Mr. Harrigan ‘s Phone sees him playing Craig, a young man who discovers he can communicate with his recently deceased friend through an iPhone. Aided by a creepy and scene-stealing Donald Sutherland, Martell makes the best out of the intriguing premise, elevating Mr. Harrigan’s Phone past other similar techno-horror movies. The film might not be based on one of Stephen King’s best-known stories, but it is among the best adaptations of the prolific author’s work.
Read less Lights Out (2016) 81m Horror, Thriller, Mystery Teresa Palmer, Maria Bello, Gabriel Bateman David F. Sandberg watch on Netflix watch on Netflix David F. Sanberg’s 2016 supernatural horror film Lights Out stars Teresa Palmer and the ever-underrated Maria Bello. Based on Sandberg’s 2013 short, the film follows Rebecca, a young woman who must protect her younger brother from a vengeful supernatural entity with a mysterious attachment to their mother. Unsettling and offering a well-deserved showcase for Palmer and Bello, Lights Out is a superior supernatural nightmare with a compelling story that never forgets about the chills and thrills that audiences love.
Read less The Babysitter (2017) 85m Comedy, Horror Judah Lewis, Samara Weaving, Robbie Amell McG watch on Netflix watch on Netflix Bonafied modern scream queen Samara Weaving stars as the titular character in McG’s 2017 slasher comedy The Babysitter.
 The plot follows a lonely 12-year-old boy Lewis, who discovers his beautiful and mysterious babysitter, Bee, is the leader of a satanic cult and wants to kill him. Benefitting from Weaving’s deliciously wicked performance and a plot that excels at if not necessarily reinvents the slasher formula, The Babysitter is an entertaining blend of horror and comedy for fans of both genres.
Read less I See You (2019) 98m Thriller, Mystery, Horror, Crime Helen Hunt, Jon Tenney, Owen Teague Adam Randall watch on Netflix watch on Netflix Academy Award winner Helen Hunt stars in the 2019 horror thriller I See You.

 But in a refreshing change of pace, the maestro of terror takes his genre chops into a more family-friendly kind of playing field with his cinematic reimagining of The Munsters.
 Starring Jeff Daniel Philips, Sheri Moon Zombie, and Daniel Roebuck as Herman, Lily, and Grandpa Munster, respectively, our story follows Lily and Herman’s ghoulish wooing of one another, serving as a fun-filled prequel to the mid-1960s TV series that we know and love.
Read less Veronica (2017) new r 105m Horror Sandra Escacena, Bruna González, Claudia Placer Paco Plaza watch on Netflix watch on Netflix When will the world learn that using ouija boards is a surefire way to get yourself mixed up with supernatural forces that won’t leave, even when you ask them nicely? In director Paco Plaza’s Veronica , the latest victim of the ghoulish phenomena turns out to be the film’s titular character, a 15-year-old girl who begins experiencing paranormal events after going a round with the infamous ouija.

Years before, Li violated a sacred Chen ritual, leading her newborn daughter to be cursed by an ancient deity. With time running out, Li must now do everything in her power to lift the hex from her child before the deity consumes the innocent girl. While the narrative veers off course here and there, as a whole, Incantation is a mostly cohesive and kinetic bit of shaky-camera scariness that we bet most viewers will thoroughly enjoy.

These are brutal and often disturbing works that thrust characters into ruthless games of survival, with only the most cunning, creative, or desperate players coming out alive. There are some standouts from the niche that are critically acclaimed thanks to their uniqueness, complexity, or bold genre-defining concepts that would go on to shape and influence modern death game movies.
From controversial classics like Battle Royale to beloved blockbusters like The Hunger Games, the best death game movies depict violent battles bound by twisted sets of rules that ensure there will be bloodshed. These adrenaline-pumping films can get viewers invested in the characters' fates and lives, which are inevitably cut short when the games begin.
