The world’s top-selling automaker announced on Monday evening that 28 lines at its 14 domestic factories, which account for about a third of Toyota’s global production, will stay closed for at least the whole of Tuesday, causing a production loss of around 13,000 vehicles.
The suspected cyberattack targeted Kojima Industries, which supplies Toyota with electronic components and plastic parts. Few details have been released about the specific nature of the attack.

How Toyota’s solid-state battery tech could revolutionize EVs Ferrari customers targeted in ransom-related cyberattack Microsoft warns that relying on Internet Explorer may cause disruptions In a short statement on its website, Toyota said : “We apologize to our relevant suppliers and customers for any inconvenience this may cause. We will also continue to work with our suppliers in strengthening the supply chain and make every effort to deliver vehicles to our customers as soon as possible.” Investigators are currently trying to learn more about the incident and whether there was a specific motive. It came just hours after Japan joined a growing number of countries imposing sanctions on Russia following its invasion of Ukraine. Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida confirmed that his government is trying to determine if Russia was involved, according to an Asahi Shimbun report.
Toyota, like most automakers, relies on a just-in-time method of manufacturing where the supply chain operates on an extremely tight schedule in order to keep factories operating at maximum efficiency. It means that delivered parts head straight to the production line instead of being stockpiled. As a result of running such a tightly controlled operation, even a small interruption to the supply chain can cause significant and rapid disruption.
Toyota’s latest production woes come as the carmaker and rival firms continue to grapple with supply chain disruptions caused by a global chip shortage that began during the pandemic. In December, the Japanese car giant announced that as a result of the shortage, it would suspend operations on seven domestic production lines at five factories throughout the first month of 2022.

The probe, codenamed First Light 2022, spanned 1,770 locations in 76 countries and took place across two months from March 8 to May 8, Interpol revealed this week.
Computing Nvidia announced that its network has been compromised, and the company is in the process of investigating a potential cybersecurity breach that took down the chipmaker's systems over the last two days. The latest cybersecurity concern adds to Nvidia's problems with chip shortages during the global pandemic, which have affected the entire semiconductor industry.
News of Nvidia's compromised internal systems was initially reported by British publication The Telegraph, which noted that it was likely a cyberattack.
Cars Toyota has done more than any other automaker to popularize hybrid cars. Japan’s largest automaker may not have been the first to bring a hybrid to the United States (that was Honda), but the Toyota Prius made the idea stick -- and it didn't end there. Over the last decade, Toyota built on the popularity of the Prius, adding hybrid powertrains to nearly every type of vehicle.
One of the most glaring gaps in Toyota’s hybrid lineup has been pickup trucks, in part because Toyota hasn’t bothered to give its Tundra pickup a full redesign since the 2007 model year. In the meantime, Ford beat Toyota off the line with its 2021 F-150 PowerBoost hybrid. For the 2022 model year, Toyota aims to make up lost ground with the Tundra i-Force Max hybrid.
