Confirmed at a OnePlus community event in London, the company said the decision was partly driven by recognizing more people are keeping their phones for longer.
Gary Chen, head of software products at OnePlus, said, “We do everything we can to enhance user experience. With more users keeping their devices for longer, we want to make sure we can offer that possibility. This new update policy will give users access to the latest security and functional features required to power OnePlus’ signature fast-and-smooth experience throughout the lifetime of the phone.” Andy Boxall/Digital Trends The change replaces the current commitment to provide three years of major updates and four years of security updates. It also matches Samsung’s update policy and manages to beat Google’s policy.
 According to Google, the Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro will receive major Android version updates until the end of 2025, meaning approximately three years of support. The phones will get five years of security updates.
It’s great news, but what isn’t clear is when the first phones that incorporate the updated policy will arrive — and it’s unfortunate it seems only some of OnePlus’ 2023 phones will get the longer update support. Currently, OnePlus has a similar system, where selected phones have a three-year update plan, while other devices — such as some Nord phones — have a far shorter update schedule. We’d expect the new policy to apply to the OnePlus 11 series.
I did a Pixel 8 and OnePlus 11 camera test. Picking a winner wasn’t easy Here’s our first look at OnePlus’ next Apple Watch killer The OnePlus 12 may fix one of the OnePlus 11’s biggest mistakes In addition to news on the new update policy, OnePlus also stated the next version of OxygenOS will launch during the first half of 2023. Called OxygenOS 13.1, little was shared in terms of features, but we’re told to expect a focus on safety and security with a new version of OnePlus’s Private Safe. This is currently at version 2.0 and performs actions like pixelating private information in screenshots from apps such as Facebook and WhatsApp. Multimedia apps, including the photo gallery, will be improved too.
Finally, in unsurprising news, the existence of OxygenOS 14 was confirmed, although the company has not provided any official information about the software. If OxygenOS 13.1 isn’t expected for what could be seven months, it’s unlikely we’ll see version 14 until much later next year or beyond.
Editors' Recommendations OnePlus 12: news, rumored price, release date, and more The worst thing has happened to one of 2023’s best Android phones For a $1,700 folding phone, the OnePlus Open has one big flaw OnePlus is about to put the Google Pixel 8 Pro to shame I tried Android 14 on my OnePlus 11 — and I’m not impressed OnePlus Tech News Mobile OnePlus Pad Go OnePlus OnePlus started its journey making fast phones that didn't cost an outrageous amount of money — a strategy that soon trickled down to earbuds and subsequently made its way to the tablet segment. The OnePlus Pad arrived in April, serving a sleek slate with a high-resolution 144Hz screen and a top-tier chip for a price lower than Apple’s entry-level iPad.
Mobile OnePlus is preparing to launch its next flagship phone in the coming months, but a fresh leak predicts an unpleasant surprise. A few weeks ago, purported renders of the OnePlus 12 depicted a phone that borrows heavily from the OnePlus 11 but adds a rectangular lens element at the back to fit a periscope-style telephoto camera.
Now, leaker OnLeaks (via MySmartPrice) has shared updated renders "based on pre-production unit pictures" that don't show any telephoto lens upgrade. Instead, we have three camera lenses with distinct circular lens inlets and a fourth cutout of the same size without any visible lens element on the camera island.
Mobile Within a span of two days this week, we got the launch dates of new iPhones and Google’s Pixel 8 series phones. Today, OnePlus also made a major announcement, albeit one that has little to do with hardware — or its highly anticipated foldable phone.
It is still a remarkable one, however. OnePlus will release Android 14-based OxygenOS 14 on September 25. That also means the stable build of Android 14 will arrive for supported Google Pixel phones before that date, and likely for some Samsung phones as well.
OnePlus will finally start public testing of Android 14 in the coming days for the OnePlus 11, the OnePlus 11R, and the OnePlus Nord 3. The company has been refining the latest iteration of OxygenOS for the past few weeks as part of a closed beta program. Soon, OnePlus will kickstart the OxygenOS 14 Open Beta program ahead of the stable release.
However, OnePlus won’t be the only brand soak-testing Android 14 ahead of its wide release later this year. Google has seeded multiple public beta builds of Android 14 over the past few months for its Pixel phones, and Samsung has also started testing One UI 6 based on Android 14 for a select bunch of high-end Galaxy phones.
