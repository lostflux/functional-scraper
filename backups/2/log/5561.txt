TPM is usually a dedicated chip on a motherboard that provides hardware encryption for features like Windows Hello and BitLocker. Most motherboards you can buy don’t come with a dedicated chip, but they do come with firmware that can look and act like TPM in Windows.
Asus ASRock Biostar EVGA Gigabyte MSI Now, major motherboard companies have finally come out with guidance on which boards come with the feature.
Asus, ASRock, Biostar, Gigabyte, and MSI are among the first motherboard makers to round up all of the chipsets that support TPM. Instead of a dedicated module, the TPM firmware uses power from the CPU for processing. This is enabled by Intel Platform Trust Technology (PTT), which is available on most consumer motherboards. It offers the same capabilities of a discrete TPM, just without a dedicated module.
‘Compact Mode’ can’t fix the Xbox app. Here’s what could Qualcomm says Oryon chips are faster than Macs’, but we’ve been here before I love Macs. But here are 5 reasons I keep coming back to Windows Although all of the chipsets below support firmware TPM, that doesn’t mean they all support Windows 11.
 CPU support only goes back to AMD Ryzen 2000 and Intel 8th-gen. Make sure to consult the list of supported AMD processors and supported Intel processors before upgrading.
After enabling TPM and running the PC Health Check app to make sure your machine is up to snuff, you can download Windows 11 and check out the new operating system.
Asus Asus Asus includes support for firmware TPM on the most recent AMD chipsets and Intel chipsets dating back several years.
To activate it on Intel motherboards, head to the BIOS, go to the Advanced tab, select AdvancedPCH-FW Configuration and change PTT to Enable.
AMD motherboards follow the same process but with different names. Look for AdvancedAMD fTPM Configuration in the Advanced tab, and switch the TPM Device Selection setting to Firmware TPM.
Intel AMD C621, C422, C246 WRX80 X299 TRX40 Z590, Q570, H570, B560, H510 X570, B550, A520 Z490, Q470, H470, B460, H410, W480 X470, B450 Z390, Z370, H370, B365, B360, H310, Q370 Z370, B350, A320 ASRock ASRock ASRock supports firmware TPM on most Intel and AMD motherboards, but it’s important to check if you have a compatible processor. Although firmware TPM may work on Intel 100-series chipsets, for example, that doesn’t mean your CPU will work with Windows 11.
On Intel boards, go to the BIOS and select the Security tab to enable TPM. Find the Intel Platform Trust Technology setting in this section and change it to Enabled.
If you have an AMD board, go to the Advanced tab and find the AMD fTPM Switch setting. Change this setting to AMD CPU fTPM.
Intel AMD Z590, H570, B560, H510 X570, B550, A520 Z490, H470, B460, H410 X470, B450 Z390, Z370, H370, B365, B360, H310, H310C X399, X370, B350, A320 Z270, H270, H110 TRX40 Z170, H170, B150, H110 X299 Biostar Biostar supports firmware TPM on a few Intel and AMD chipsets. The company hasn’t provided any guidance on how to enable TPM in the BIOS, but the process should be similar to the brands above. Look for a Security or Advanced tab, where you should find a setting for TPM or Intel PTT.
Intel AMD Z590, B560, H510 X570, B550, A520 B460, H410 X470, B450 H310 X370, B350, A320 B250 J4105NHU EVGA Outside of a single new AMD motherboard — which supports TPM 2.0 — EVGA only sells Intel boards. Once again, these are the chipsets that support TPM 2.0, not the ones that support Windows 11. The steep CPU requirements on Windows 11 mean that some of the below chipsets won’t work on the OS.
To enable TPM 2.0 , enter the BIOS, select Setup, go to Advanced, and find the Trusted Computing option. There, select Intel PTT Support, save your changes, and reboot your machine.
Intel Z590 Z490 Z390, Z370, H370, B360 Z270 Z170 Gigabyte Gigabyte motherboards with the latest AMD and Intel chipsets support firmware TPM. As with Biostar, Gigabyte hasn’t provided any guidance on enabling the feature, but you will likely find it in the Settings menu with a reference to TPM or Intel PTT.
Intel AMD C621, C232, C236, C246 TRX40 X299 AMD 500 series Intel 500 series AMD 400 series Intel 400 series AMD 300 series Intel 300 series MSI MSI MSI supports firmware TPM on the last several AMD and Intel chipsets. Similar to ASRock, the list below compromises chipsets that support TPM 2.0, not chipsets that support Windows 11. Make sure to check your processor against the list of officially supported ones.
To enable TPM on Intel boards, go to the BIOS and select the Settings menu. Then, follow Security > Trusted Computing and change the TPM Device Selection setting to PTT.
For AMD, go to the BIOS and select the Security tab, then turn on Security Device Support and select AMD fTPM Switch.

Here’s what’s new Surprise: Windows 11 is doing much better than we thought This simple keyboard shortcut could save you when installing Windows 11 The best Windows 11 themes News Microsoft Microsoft Windows Tech News Windows 11 Computing Did we just get a confirmation about the release time frame for Windows 12 -- and from Intel, of all sources? It seems that way. Intel spoke about its predictions for 2024, indicating that it expects 2024 to be a good year for client processors. That's huge for Intel because the next generation of its top processors, Meteor Lake, is set to come out in 2024. However, if Intel is right, it might be a big year for Microsoft, too.
The information comes from a transcript of the Citi 2023 Global Technology Conference. Most of it wasn't too exciting -- fireside chats aren't often that interesting to the masses -- but there's a little comment in there that piqued our interest.
Computing In the consumer space, Windows 11 adoption has been ticking along at a reasonable pace. For businesses, however, the OS may have reached its limit, as businesses struggle to upgrade machines to meet the minimum requirements.
IT asset management group Lansweeper has observed that the adoption of Windows 11 now stands at 8.35% as of October 2023, a slight jump from the 5.74% seen in September 2022. However, having conducted research on approximately 33 million Windows devices in the enterprise sector, Lansweeper has concluded that it is largely device incompatibility that is stalling Windows 11 updates on a grand scale.
Computing A quick PSA: If you own one of AMD's best graphics cards and you like to tweak the settings, now is not a good time to download the latest Windows Update. According to users on the AMD forums, the KB5030310 update really doesn't agree with AMD's Adrenalin Control Panel. While it's not the end of the world, this isn't the first Windows update in the last few months that has caused problems.
It appears that every time people restart their PCs, their Adrenalin settings are all reset back to default. This means that any changes made to things like AMD's Anti-Lag or Hyper RX will disappear upon every boot. Fortunately, the graphics driver itself is unaffected.
