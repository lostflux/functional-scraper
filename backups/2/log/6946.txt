Why trust us? The best indoor security cameras of 2023 By Tyler Lacoma Close Indoor security cameras have a host of uses around a home or business. They can watch for intruders, keep an eye on pets, serve as baby monitors, help guide guests, and generally be on the lookout for anything unusual. If you’re interested in an indoor cam that can do it all, these are the top smart options from the best brands on the market! More John Velasco / Digital Trends Wyze Cam v3 Very affordable Works both indoors and outdoors More detail with color night vision Tons of security controls Integrated power cord This indoor/outdoor cam is ready for just about anything, including outdoor security. The 1080p cam is equipped with an upgraded Starlight Sensor that has full-color night vision and a new lens that can capture even more light in dark areas. There are both motion and sound sensors for alerts, and users can carefully adjust motion zones and detection levels to avoid false alarms in a specific environment.
Like many of our picks, the Wyze Cam v3 works with both Alexa and Google Assistant and is also certified for IFTTT if you would like to create more advanced routines using the cam and its alerts. You’ll need a microSD card for local storage, but there is free 14-day rolling cloud storage for temporarily saving videos when you’re away — one of the better cloud storage packages currently available for security cams.
John Velasco / Digital Trends Nest Cam indoor/outdoor (battery) Works both indoors and out Stores three hours of video history for free Great contrast with HDR video Magnetic plate has a strong connection Bulky design Details are a bit soft In this latest camera from Google, Nest’s simple design hides some cutting-edge technology — a wireless model that you can set up just about anywhere. The 1080p video includes HDR compatibility and night vision. There’s two-way audio for communication, motion detection, and some seriously smart machine learning at work. The cam can detect people, animals, and vehicles, and if you spring for the Nest Aware package, it can even learn familiar faces so you can customize all your alerts. Google Assistant compatibility is a given, but don’t expect Nest cams to work with Alexa.
The Nest Cam (battery) comes with the ability to save up to three hours of alert-based history for free or more with an Aware subscription. The downside to all the advanced Google tech is that this Nest Cam is significantly more expensive than anything we’ve discussed so far. You get some of the best features available, but you do have to pay as much as you would for a suite of other security cams.
Best Amazon Echo Black Friday deals: Echo Pop, Echo Show 8, and more Best Waterpik Black Friday deals on water flossers and toothbrushes The best KitchenAid mixer Black Friday deals (and accessories from $17) Image used with permission by copyright holder Blink Indoor Security Cam Long battery life Two-way audio Simple Alexa integration Basic motion detection skills Blink’s 1080p indoor cam is an excellent example of a security cam that’s ideal for a home or business while still being highly affordable. It’s also wireless, which makes it particularly easy to set up wherever you want, perched on a shelf or mounted to a wall. (Note: There are two lithium batteries included that will need to be recharged periodically.) The cam includes motion detection that can send alerts to your phone when it detects activity and two-way audio for talking to guests and pets or scaring intruders. It’s also Alexa compatible, so you can use it with devices like Echo Shows to get a cam live feed.
You’ll also note that the Blink Indoor cam comes with a Sync Module 2 that’s designed to work with a USB flash drive to locally save data the cam captures. You can’t save data to the cloud without a Blink subscription plan, so the Module is important if you want to keep video clips without paying any monthly fees. While we chose the single-camera package, it’s easy to get bundles with additional cams to outfit a larger area.
More John Velasco / Digital Trends Arlo Essential Indoor Camera Privacy shutter offers peace of mind Crisp and clear night vision Intelligent detection with Arlo Smart Artifacting elements in video quality The Arlo Essential Indoor Security Camera gives you everything you'd expect from a premium indoor camera. Beyond its 1080p video capture and impressive night vision, you'll be able to set up activity zones, get smart alerts with Arlo Smart, and have access to a privacy shutter.
It also comes with an adjustable base that makes it easy to find the optimal viewing angle for your space. As if that weren't enough, Arlo includes a mounting bracket so you can place it on a wall or in the corner of a room. You'll pay a bit more for this camera than others on the list, but it's a great option if you don't mind the added expense.
Image used with permission by copyright holder Blink Mini Pan-Tilt Best indoor camera for 360-degree video Affordable cost Simple setup Crisp-sounding audio Soft -looking video footage Cheap construction The Blink Mini on its own is a solid device, though it's not quite as capable as other cameras on this list. But when paired with the Pan-Tilt Mount, it becomes an impressive smart home product and an easy recommendation. With the ability to record 1080p footage, adjustable motion zones, smart alerts, and the option to remotely swivel it to cover all corners of your home, few indoor cameras offer this sort of versatility. The Blink Mini Pan-Tilt Mount only becomes more impressive after seeing its affordable price tag. It doesn't have a built-in privacy shutter, but that's a minor inconvenience for an otherwise well-rounded device.
Phil Nickinson / Digital Trends Ring Stick Up Cam Pro Works indoors and outdoors Captures 1080p HDR footage Easy installation Large size No privacy shutter The Ring Stick Up Cam Pro is a powerful device built for indoor and outdoor use. If you're using it inside, installation is as simple as charging its battery and placing it on your countertop. It also comes with a mounting plate if you prefer to place it on your wall. Images are impressive thanks to its 1080p HDR footage capture, and it works well in lowlight situations thanks to color night vision. And like most Ring products, it offers real-time notifications, the option to set up privacy zones, and the ability to easily sync with the rest of your Ring devices.
One minor caveat to keep in mind with the Ring Stick Up Cam Pro is its size. Unlike the tiny Wyze Cam v3 or Arlo Essential Indoor Camera, the Stick Up Cam Pro is on the larger side. Standing just over six inches tall and just under three inches wide, it takes up a fair bit of space. It also doesn't feature a built-in privacy shutter, though you can easily turn off motion detection by enabling Home mode. Aside from those quirks, the Ring Stick Up Cam Pro is a premium camera that'll work well anywhere in your house.
