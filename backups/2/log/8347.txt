Moghbeli and O’Hara will be working “to remove an electronics box called the Radio Frequency Group from a communications antenna on station,” according to NASA , and “[t]hey also will replace one of 12 trundle bearing assemblies on a solar alpha rotary joint.” These joints are part of the system that points the station’s solar panels towards the sun, allowing the panels to absorb more energy from the sun’s rays by tilting them to track the sun as the station orbits the Earth.
