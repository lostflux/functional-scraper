The news comes on the same day that reviews for Apple‚Äôs 24-inch iMac M3 and MacBook Pro M3 went live, with the company urging pro users who had been waiting for a 27-inch iMac update to go with a Mac Studio or Mac Pro instead.
An Apple representative confirmed that a 27-inch iMac with Apple silicon won‚Äôt be arriving soon to The Verge.
 Apple last updated the 27-inch iMac in 2020, just a few months before Apple silicon was released to the world. It never saw Apple Silicon, instead being stuck on older Intel chips. Apple discontinued the product in 2021, eventually delisting it the next year.
Despite that, pro users held out hope for a new 27-inch iMac, and even among new Mac launches this fall, reports were mounting that Apple planned a release of a 27-inch iMac in 2024. Unlike the 24-inch iMac, which is targeted at home and office use, the 27-inch model has traditionally been a pro-focused model that could scale to accommodate more powerful processors. The 24-inch iMac, for example, is stuck on the base M3 processor and likely won‚Äôt see an update to the more powerful M3 Pro or M3 Max.
Even with the release of a new 24-inch iMac, which hasn‚Äôt seen an update since the original M1 processor, our iMac M3 review starts with: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a new iMac. It‚Äôs not the one everyone‚Äôs been waiting for ‚Äî the one with a larger screen and an M3 Pro.‚Äù Although it doesn‚Äôt look like we‚Äôll get a 27-inch iMac any time soon, The Verge notes that the door is still open for larger models. There are still rumors that Apple is prepping a 32-inch iMac for a release in either 2024 or 2025. Given the news about the 27-inch iMac, however, that seems unlikely. Apple seems to be focusing its effort on the Mac Studio and Mac Pro, combined with the 27-inch Studio Display.
In the future, it‚Äôs possible Apple will revisit the 27-inch iMac, but that also seems unlikely. Since the release of the M1, Apple has focused less on its pro products, with the Mac Pro only transitioning to Apple silicon earlier this year.
Also no plans for a new 21.5-inch ü§£ https://t.co/uWGykFylEX &mdash; Mark Gurman (@markgurman) November 6, 2023 Adding on top of the news, journalist Mark Gurman poked fun at the report saying that there are no plans for a 21.5-inch iMac either, which previously sat alongside the 27-inch model. We weren‚Äôt expecting a new 21.5-inch model regardless, but Gurman has reported that Apple looking toward a 32-inch iMac to launch in late 2024 or early 2025, but it‚Äôs too soon to say if that could happen with any certainty.

Computing Apple is finally hitting its stride with gaming. The company today announced the new M3 family of chips during its "Scary Fast" event, and they pack a redesigned GPU that adds some much-needed features for gaming in 2023. There's just one problem -- you can't play a ton of games on Mac.
There are some great games available on Mac -- just check out our list of the best Mac games -- but the big hurdle for Apple has always been broad game support. With the release of M3, along with some recent developments to porting games from Windows to Mac, Apple has a chance to make its gaming ambitions a reality. But all of that effort won't matter until we see games releasing on the platform alongside PC and consoles.
A game-changing GPU Computing Macs with Apple silicon were a revelation when they launched three years ago, but we haven't seen Apple demonstrate how it will carry that idea forward since then. We saw the M2 release and the middling performance improvements that came with it, but the M3, announced during Apple's "Scary Fast" event, is the most important chip Apple has ever designed for Macs.
Although it carries the branding of the third generation of Apple silicon, it's really the second true generation. There's a lot riding on this release for Apple to prove that it can sustain its own silicon in Macs, and M3 is arriving at a time when there's fierce competition on all sides.
