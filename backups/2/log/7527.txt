In the new trailer for the Disney+ series, Marvel revealed that a new episode from season 2 will debut for nine consecutive days starting December 22, 2023.
The Watcher (Jeffrey Wright) narrates What If…? and guides audiences through alternate realities where major events in the MCU happened differently. For example, what if Peggy Carter, not Steve Rogers, were the First Avenger? What if T’Challa became Star-Lord and not the Black Panther? What if Thor were an only child? As The Watcher states in the trailer : “Things have gotten a little twisted in the multiverse.” Many of the MCU’s live-action actors reprise their roles in What If…? to voice the animated versions of their characters.
Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter , Benedict Cumberbatch as Dr. Stephen Strange, Chadwick Boseman as Star-Lord T’Challa, Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner/Hulk, Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, and Chris Hemsworth as Thor have all provided their voices for What If…? Season 2 will feature more characters, including Karen Gillan’s Nebula, Jon Favreau’s Happy Hogan, and Cate Blanchett’s Hela. Future episodes in season 2 will feature characters from Shang-Chi facing off against Odin, a team-up between Valkyrie and Iron Man, and Peggy squaring off against the evil Hydra Stomper.

Editors' Recommendations 3 things that The Marvels got right 7 best cosmic Marvel characters ever, ranked 7 things the MCU should do in a revised Multiverse saga Is Thor: The Dark World really the worst Marvel movie? The Marvels just might be the MCU’s first huge box office disaster Comic Book Movies Marvel Tech News Entertainment It's only been about three years since the last X-Men movie but already fans miss those merry band of mutants. Sure, the movies weren't perfect, and some, like X-Men Origins: Wolverine and X-Men: Apocalypse, were outright bad, but they still had a certain charm, an irresistible nostalgic pull that most people couldn't resist. The Fox X-Men movies were the first true cinematic comic book universe, and they established a foundation that helped the MCU take over the world with 2008's Iron Man.
The Marvels | What Comes Next | In Theaters Nov 10 Entertainment Among the upcoming Marvel Studios original series, Echo has been one of the question marks because its leading character, Maya Lopez, is not a headlining heroine in Marvel's comics. However, the first trailer for Echo has been released by Disney+ and Hulu (which will both stream the series), and the first footage goes a long way towards winning us over by heavily leaning into the show's TV-MA rating. Especially when Maya's former guardian, Wilson Fisk (Vincent D'Onofrio), brutally beats a man as Maya looks on.
Marvel Studios' Echo | Official Trailer | Disney+ and Hulu Entertainment Tom Hiddleston is being pulled through time in the season 2 trailer for Marvel Studios’ Loki, and if what he witnessed was true, "There is nothing that stands between this world and utter destruction." Hiddleston returns for season 2 as Loki, the god of mischief recruited to work for the Time Variance Authority (TVA) to monitor and fix the timeline. In the season 1 finale, the timeline was thrown into complete disarray after Sylvie (Sophia Di Martino) stabs He Who Remains (Jonathan Majors), leading to the creation of the multiverse.
