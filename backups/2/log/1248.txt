Watching Avatar: The Way of Water on the TV was quite the spectacle, with the darker scenes, in particular, being rich in detail and contrast, and the brighter scenes being just as visually stimulating.
The 65-inch model, which is listed in this deal, was just the right size for my living room, but Samsung does offer the S95C in a smaller 55-inch frame if preferred.
Also: The best Samsung TVs you can buy View now at Best Buy Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 Save $500 June Wan/ZDNET Current price: $1,299 Original price: $1,799 Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold 5 is not the latest foldable phone on the market, but it is one of the best. The device comes with a 6.2-inch external display that's ideal for quick tasks and messaging and a larger 7.6-inch inner display that's great for multimedia consumption. In a way, you're paying for a smartphone and a tablet.
Compared to the competition, the Galaxy Z Fold 5 brings a level of maturity and refinement that's a step above, with premium materials, improved durability, and software that's well-optimized for multitasking. Right now, you can pick up Samsung's phone-to-tablet foldable at a $500 discount, its lowest price ever.
View now at Amazon Samsung 32-inch M80C Smart Monitor Save $300 June Wan/ZDNET Current price: $400 Original price: $700 Samsung's claim to fame may well be its TVs, but the M80C is a little different than its usual offerings. The M80C is a smart monitor, meaning you can tether it to a desktop or laptop in an office space, and when you're done for the day, kick back and switch it to TV mode.
Review: Samsung M8 Smart Monitor: A sub-$700 Apple Studio Display alternative? The M80C comes in a decent-sized 32-inch frame with built-in speakers and Tizen OS, Samsung's TV software, for quick access to streaming services like Netflix, Disney+, Max, and more. And right now, you can pick one up at a $300 discount.
View now at Best Buy Samsung 4.5 cu. ft. Front Load Washer Save $370 June Wan/ZDNET Current price: $629 Original price: $999 If you're looking for a new washer, Samsung has a 4.5 cu. ft. unit that's great for high-volume cleaning and has a slew of smart features. For example, the washer comes with Vibration Reduction Technology+ which, to no surprise, reduces the banging noise that's typically associated with more powerful washers. There's also built-in self-cleaning to eliminate any bacteria that's leftover from worn clothes.
Samsung is selling the washer at a $370 discount during its pre-Black Friday sale, and the appliance is eligible for next-day delivery in select zip codes.

This one from Samsung is one of the company's latest, the T9 Portable SSD, and not only does it field upwards of a 4TB capacity, but it boosts read and write speeds of up to 2,000MB per second.
The T9 Portable SSD is easy to pocket, great for content creators and users who just want a more secure and physical storage space, and can be had right now for $90 less than retail.
Also: 2TB SSD in your pocket? Samsung's tiny T5 gets speed boost View now at Amazon When is Black Friday 2023? The official date for Black Friday 2023 is November 24, 2023, the day after Thanksgiving.
However, as has been the case the past few years, manufacturers are offering the best holiday discounts weeks, if not days, in advance.
How did we choose these early Black Friday deals? ZDNET only writes about deals we want to buy -- devices and products we desire, need, or would recommend. Our experts looked for deals that were at least 20% off (or are hardly ever on sale), using established price comparison tools and trackers to determine whether the deal is actually on sale and how frequently it drops.
We also looked over customer reviews to find out what matters to real people who already own and use the deals we're recommending. Our recommendations may also be based on our own testing -- in addition to extensive research and comparison shopping. The goal is to deliver the most accurate advice to help you shop smarter.
