Why trust us? You can lease an electric scooter for a month for only $19 By John Alexander Close.
You land the big tech job, you move to a big city. But it turns out that rent is expensive. And parking spots cost significantly extra now? It’s a little much for your four block commute. If this situation rings a bell, you should consider the Unagi E500 Electric Scooter for your commute. It’s usually leasable for $59 a month, but right now you can get your first month for $19, saving you $40 and giving you a good chance to check the machine out on the cheap. It comes with free servicing and insurance, too, so all you need to “pay” extra is the electricity cost to charge it. Once your trial is over, you’ll go back to $59 per month while you’re sill leasing the scooter, but we’re seeing some customer reports of getting this $19/month deal extending up to 3 months after talking with the company. Tap the button below to check it out.
Why you should lease a Unagi E500 Electric Scooter The Unagi E500 is a sleek, folding scooter that weighs just 28.5 pounds, making it convenient to use anywhere and store beside your desk at work or school. Its tires are rubber, not the hard plastic that might’ve put you off of this style of scooter back in the early 2000’s. Much like the plastic ones, however, these tires are puncture-proof, made solid with small air pockets throughout. And, again, if there is an issue, Unagi has servicing of the scooter covered under your deal.
But how does such a bike feel to ride? We got one of our tech reviewers off the computer and onto a scooter for a Unagi E500 review.
 He appreciated its ability to quickly ramp up to 13 to 14 mph and, then, gradually rise to a max of about 17 mph. Both braking and accelerating controls felt smooth and safe to operate, essential when confronted with a clueless car suddenly lunging in front of you or any one of a million other urban obstacles. And that’s what this is, a great urban ride that’s designed around getting high-functionality over style.
To grab one for yourself now, just tap the button below. You’ll be able to get a Unagi E500 in your hands for just $19, which is $40 less than the normal monthly rental of $59. After your initial experience with the bike, your price will go back to $59, but you can cancel at any time.
Editors' Recommendations Flash deal knocks $140 off this 48-amp home electric vehicle charger The best October Prime Day dash cam deals you can shop now Deal: Save $120 on this 25ft, 32-Amp home electric vehicle charger Save up to 26% on Pioneer vehicle stereo receivers at Best Buy The best electric cars you can buy in 2023 Deals Cars Mobile tech and software have expanded to the car over the last few years, with many newer vehicles offering Apple CarPlay and Android Auto built right into the media display. But if you have an older vehicle and want the perks of modern technology right in your dashboard, it’s much cheaper to buy a new in-dash media receiver instead of a new car. This is especially true today, as we’ve tracked down some of the best deals on digital media receivers available for your vehicle.
JVC 6.8-inch digital media receiver — $280, was $300 This 6.8-inch digital media receiver is a good one if you’re looking to upgrade your vehicle’s media capabilities on a budget.

The large touchscreen is easy to navigate and allows you to manage music, settings and functions. This digital media receiver also has a built-in equalizer, so you’ll be able to listen to whatever you want in any way you want. You can also tap into your mobile device’s music library with this digital media receiver, as it allows for Bluetooth connectivity and even has a USB port that allows you to connect to your device.
Cars Take a quick peek at the latest roundup showing off the best Best Buy deals on offer and you probably won't find anything quite like this next one. If you have an older vehicle or a base model that lacks a remote start option, you'd be forgiven for thinking there was no hope of getting it -- at least not without upgrading to a new car. The reality is you can enable it by installing a third-party solution, and Best Buy is offering a deal on a remote start system right now plus installation.
The Compustar one-way remote start system includes everything you need to set it all up, and get this, installation is included. Normally $350, you can save $50 right now, and get it for $300. Just make sure installation is available at your local store. Grab that deal below or keep reading to learn more about Compustar's remote start system.

Why you should buy the Juicebox 25ft Electric Vehicle Charger If you've been reading up on how to charge your electric car at home, you'll notice Juicebox gets a mention.
