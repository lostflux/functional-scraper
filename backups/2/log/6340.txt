Why trust us? This $4,000 smart door comes packing a Ring video doorbell and Yale smart lock By Jon Bitner Close Smart home gadgets span a wide range of categories. From video doorbells and robot vacuums to outdoor cameras and smart speakers , smart gadgets can be found in all corners of the modern home. Now, thanks to Home Depot , you can now snag the first residential smart door — and it features a built-in Yale smart lock and Ring video doorbell.
Before you rush out to your local Home Depot, it’s worth noting that this futuristic smart door comes with a hefty price tag of $4,000. Multiple styles are available, including two different sizes and additional sidelites, and depending on your configuration, its price can balloon to an eye-watering $7,000.
Masonite While that price might be a bit steep, the Masonite M-PWR Smart Door does come with plenty of features to help justify its cost. This includes LED lights, motion sensors, a Ring Video Doorbell, a Yale smart lock, and a sensor that can detect if your door is open or closed.
Best of all, the smart door connects to your home’s electrical system, meaning you won’t have to worry about running out of juice (though a backup battery is on board in case of a power outage).

Picking the right Yale Assure Lock 2 Smart Home Most battery-powered Ring video doorbells will last between six to 12 months, with a wide degree of variability depending on your climate, usage, and specific model. If you find your video doorbell falling below that range (or want to optimize its performance), there are several steps you can take to improve your Ring video doorbell's battery life.
From changing your motion settings to adjusting your Wi-Fi settings, here’s how to get a bit more juice out of your battery-powered Ring video doorbell.

In fact, many of them use batteries that will wear out after just a few years, forcing you to replace them.

Here’s a closer look at how long your video doorbell will be supported by the manufacturer, along with tips to help you decide when it’s time for a full replacement.
