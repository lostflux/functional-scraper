Since then, Ford had rolled out several other plug-in-powered cars including the Ford Focus Electric and the Fusion Energi.
Quietly, Ford has penned a new agreement, apparently, with AeroVironment to do the same job.
Many Americans don’t buy EVs because they don’t understand them, says Ford What happened to the Geek Squad account? We asked Jason Lasecki, Ford EV Communications Manager. “Best Buy decided to transition out of the EVSE Installation business to focus more on their core areas of expertise,” Lasecki said. “AeroVironment has an excellent record of installing stations in residential, commercial and public settings with high quality and attention to detail. It’s a nice fit for Ford.” To date, AeroVironment has installed over 11,000 charging stations nationwide. Customers interested in ordering from AeroVironment can initiate the process with a single call, though an online system is in the works. Clearly, AeroVironment has its act together as many customers – depending on local regulations and layout of their property – will be able to schedule their charging station install in a single visit.
We were always a bit wary when contracts get moved around like this, and we’re wondering if they got the contract based upon their name rather than expertise. However, AeroVironment seems to be the right step for Ford but we’ll have to wait and see how it plays out.
Editors' Recommendations Best Buy’s deal of the day is $120 off a 25ft electric car charger Emerging Tech Emerging Tech Cars Lucid Motors has become the latest automaker to announce that it will adopt the North American Charging Standard (NACS) – also known as "the Tesla plug" – for its electric vehicles.
The move follows in the footsteps of more than a dozen other automakers that have also adopted Tesla’s charging connector, among them General Motors, Ford, Toyota, BMW, Jaguar Land Rover, Volvo, and Honda.
Cars General Motors-owned Cruise has halted production of its fully driverless vehicle -- the Origin -- just over a week after it suspended robotaxi operations nationwide following a number of troubling incidents involving its cars.
The news was announced by Cruise CEO Kyle Vogt during a meeting with staff on Monday, according to Forbes, which obtained audio of the gathering.
Cars The Ram brand is finally taking an electrified approach, and by resurrecting the Ramcharger name, no less. Alongside the new 2025 Ram 1500, the company has unveiled the new 2025 Ram 1500 Ramcharger, a new plug-in hybrid that Ram touts as offering "unlimited battery electric range." The new truck is one of a number of electrified trucks, the most well-known of which include the fully-electric Ford F-150 Lightning and the new Chevrolet Silverado EV. But instead of being fully electric, the 1500 Ramcharger is a plug-in hybrid, meaning that it has an electric motor and battery, and a gas tank and engine.
The plug-in approach It's perhaps a smart move. Electric trucks show a lot of promise -- but they start to falter a little when it comes to things like towing and hauling heavy loads. Keeping the 1500 Ramcharger a hybrid means that with no load or light ones, the truck can zip around town on electric power -- and when necessary, it can switch the engine on to tow or haul. It could well be the perfect combo for many truck owners who at least occasionally need that extra oomph, but who still could stand to save some cash -- and go a little easier on the environment - when simply driving around town.
