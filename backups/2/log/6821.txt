Why trust us? LG’s 2023 SC9 and SE6 soundbars are now available By Phil Nickinson Close LG announced its 2023 SC9 and SE6 soundbars just before the end of 2022. And they’re now available, nearly a quarter of the way through 2023.
The SC9 — also known as the Sound Bar C — is the better of the two, with 3.1.3-channel sound and 400 Watts of power. It’s the first to include IMAX Enhanced, Dolby Atmos , and DTS:X with three up-firing channels. It also ships with LG’s Synergy Bracket, which is great if you also own a 2022 or 2023 LG OLED C Series television and should keep cables out of sight.
LG It’ll cost you, though — SC9 retails at $999.
The SE6 drops that price in half but also only has a quarter of the power in a 3.0 configuration. It’ll sound just fine, for sure, with a 25mm tweeter and four passive radiators, but perhaps not as spectacular. (Also note that it lacks a subwoofer.) Both soundbars, however, feature LG’s Triple Level Spatial Sound, as well as the Triple AI Sound Optimizer. That is, they can listen to the environment of the room and adjust accordingly. They also support 4K passthrough up to 120Hz with variable refresh rate.
LG’s 2023 soundbars go wireless, get on-screen controls, and game-friendly inputs LG QNED mini-LED TVs, Dolby Atmos soundbars see big improvements at CES 2022 LG’s decor-friendly, ultra-compact Eclair soundbar delivers Dolby Atmos for $599 And if you’re using one of these with an LG TV — which is exactly what the company is hoping you’ll do — you’ll have access to the WOW Orchestra feature, which uses the sound from the soundbar itself in addition to the built-in speakers on the TV “to create an expanded soundstage with improved height, depth and power to produce the ultimate listening experience.” So there’s that. You’ll also get a WOW Interface on the TV’s home dashboard.
If that’s not enough WOW, there’s also WOWCAST, which lets you connect the SC9 or SE6 to any TV, wirelessly, so long as it’s got an HDMI ARC and USB input.
LG SE6 LG SC9 Editors' Recommendations LG releases 2023 OLED TV prices: evo G3 starts at $2,500, preorders start March 6 LG’s 2022 soundbars start at $400, pump out hi-res audio and 3D sound The LG S95QR Soundbar leads the way for a new audio line at CES LG’s WebOS 6.0 adds a content-first experience and a new remote From $60 to $300, TCL’s 2020 soundbar lineup is incredibly affordable LG Soundbars Speakers Tech News Audio / Video LG revealed the pricing and availability of its 2020 soundbar lineup, which features five different Dolby Atmos-supported models.
The new roster includes seven different soundbars, two of which are already available. Two of LG’s top models, a pair of CES 2020 Innovation Award winners in the $1,699 SN11RG and $999 SN9YG, will be available later this month alongside the $1,299 SN10YG and $799 SN8YG. One additional soundbar, the $499 SN7Y will debut in June.
Audio / Video This story is part of our continuing coverage of CES 2020, including tech and gadgets from the showroom floor.
Just before CES 2020 got underway, LG released some of the details for its 2020 lineup of soundbars. The biggest new feature is called AI Room Calibration, a system that automatically adjusts the sonic properties of LG's premium soundbar models to better match the acoustics of the room.
Audio / Video The TCL Alto 9+ soundbar isn't new -- TCL showed it off at IFA 2019 in September -- but that hasn't stopped it from making an appearance at CES 2020. Its reason for being there? To showcase Roku TV Ready in action. This new initiative allows people to control their soundbar using their Roku TV Remote, which calls upon the volume buttons to adjust the sound and on-screen menus to configure the audio exactly how they want it.
Having seen the Alto 9+ twice now, we have an idea of what it's all about. Its headline feature is Ray-Danz -- a unique audio dispersion method that uses two side-firing speakers and a host of reflectors to bend the sound around the room, with a third, front-firing speaker delivering accurate voice positioning. Then there's Dolby Atmos to add depth on the horizontal and vertical planes, and a wireless subwoofer (in the box) to tie it all together.
