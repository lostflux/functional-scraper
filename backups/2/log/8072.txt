 EcoFlow was an early pioneer in that space, and now that its batteries are everywhere, it’s been working on some applications for all that power in the great outdoors. At CES 2023 , the company debuted a cooler, air conditioner, and robotic lawnmower.
Image used with permission by copyright holder To call the Glacier a “cooler” might be a bit of a misnomer – it comes with an integrated 250 watt-hour battery that keeps the contents cool sans ice, no external battery needed. Not only does it not need ice, but it makes it. EcoFlow claims the integrated icemaker can whip up a batch of cubes in 12 minutes flat. Like the Furrion Rova we saw at CES 2019, cold space is divided into two compartments: one to keep things cold, one to keep things frozen. And since there’s a battery built right in, you can even charge gadgets from it.

While the old model could only move 4,000 BTUs, the Wave 2 has a cooling capacity of 5,100 BTUs. For reference, that’s comparable with the smallest size of traditional window air conditioners. And for those chilly nights, the Wave 2 also works as a heat pump for a more efficient way of electric heating than space heaters. EcoFlow claims it should have a runtime of eight hours on its lowest output with its integrated battery, and DC connectors let you add more power without the loss of an AC inverter.

EcoFlow hasn’t yet priced any of the new units, but for reference, the original Wave retailed for $1,500, and the Furrion eRove cooler goes for $1,000. All three EcoFlow devices are slated for launch in 2023.
Editors' Recommendations Goodbye, coolers. The EcoFlow Glacier doesn’t need ice — it makes it CES 2023 Tech News Outdoors EcoFlow, a manufacturer of portable energy solutions, has announced the launch of the Delta 2 Max -- an eco-friendly solar generator that could replace your current gas generator. The device clocks in at 2,048 watts and should deliver enough power to keep your home running for two days as an emergency backup (or many more if you’re using it as an off-grid power source).
The original Delta Max was a popular item for outdoor adventures, as it could connect to the existing lineup of portable EcoFlow solar panels to juice up gadgets while out in the backcountry. That legacy continues with the Delta 2 Max, which features an upgraded lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery for a longer life cycle and faster charging.
