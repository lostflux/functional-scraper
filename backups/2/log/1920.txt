Apr 2023 Call for Kambule Doctoral & Alele-Williams Masters Nomination Reviewers Deep Learning Indaba 2023 What are the Kambule and Alele-Williams Awards? The Thamsanqa Kambule and Grace Alele-Williams Awards recognise and encourage excellence in research and writing by doctoral and master’s candidates, respectively, at African universities, in any area of computational and statistical sciences.
The Kambule Doctoral Award celebrates African research excellence: its recipients uphold Thamsanqa Kambule’s legacy as a defender of learning, a seeker of knowledge, and an activist for equality.
The Alele-William Masters Award celebrates African research excellence: its recipients uphold Alele-Williams’ legacy as a mathematician, a tireless champion of women in science, and an educationalist who influenced modern mathematics curricula across Africa.
The awards will be presented at the annual Deep Learning Indaba, Accra, Ghana in September 2023. We welcomed nominations from both students themselves, and their supervisors and mentors. Both The Kambule Doctoral and the Alele-William Masters winners will be awarded a cash prize and will travel to speak at the Deep Learning Indaba.
