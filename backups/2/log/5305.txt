Here‚Äôs how autonomous AI agents are taking over the internet By Luke Larsen Close ChatGPT has taken the world by storm, in large part thanks to its dead-simple framework. It‚Äôs just an AI chatbot , capable of producing convincing, natural-language text in responses to the user.
What is Auto-GPT? How does Auto-GPT work? Use cases for Auto-GPT How to use Auto-GPT Has Auto-GPT achieved AGI? But with AI chatbots, a lot relies on a person‚Äôs ability to come up with prompts that the AI will respond to. Auto-GPT is a new application that allows AI to act autonomously that can ‚Äúself-prompt,‚Äù and it‚Äôs completely changing the way we think about this technology.
What is Auto-GPT? Image used with permission by copyright holder Auto-GPT is an open-source Python application that was posted on GitHub on March 30, 2023, by a developer called Significant Gravitas.
 Using GPT-4 as its basis, the application allows the AI to act ‚Äúautonomously‚Äù without the need for the user to prompt every action. You can get Auto-GPT an overall goal, and step-by-step, will take actions to accomplish that goal. That is where the concept of ‚ÄúAI agents‚Äù comes from, which are using the internet and performing actions on a PC completely on its own ‚Äî without the need to be prompted at every step.
GPT-4 Turbo is the biggest update since ChatGPT‚Äôs launch OpenAI‚Äôs new tool can spot fake AI images, but there‚Äôs a catch This powerful ChatGPT feature is back from the dead ‚Äî with a few key changes The simple example posted in the original GitHub is of Auto-GPT given the goal of browsing the web to come up with unique and original recipes for ‚Äúthe next upcoming event,‚Äù such as Easter. Chef-GPT, as it was named, then starts searching the web for a solution. The second goal was to save the recipe as a file on the user‚Äôs computer.
On its own, that might not sound all that innovative. But Auto-GPT‚Äôs ability to search the internet on behalf of the user and perform actions like saving files takes this AI far beyond a simple chatbot.
How does Auto-GPT work? One of the fascinating things about Auto-GPT is the way it breaks out the AI‚Äôs steps, which is where GPT‚Äôs excellent text generation comes in. Auto-GPT calls them ‚Äúthoughts,‚Äù ‚Äúreasoning,‚Äù and ‚Äúcriticism‚Äù ‚Äî telling you exactly what the AI is doing and why. In the example of Chef-GPT from above, its first ‚Äúthought‚Äù was as follows: ‚ÄúI will search for upcoming events to find a suitable one for creating a unique recipe.‚Äù The ‚Äúreasoning,‚Äù then, is that ‚ÄúFinding an upcoming event will help me come up with a relevant and exciting recipe.‚Äù The ‚Äúcriticism‚Äù produced by Auto-GPT will express some of the concerns and limitations around what it‚Äôs doing. As you can see, Auto-GPT is taking steps completely autonomously to accomplish the goals given by the user.
A few other neat features of Auto-GPT include long/short-term memory and text-to-speech integration via ElevenLabs.
 The combination of all these features makes Auto-GPT feels much more like an AI made to interact with humans.
Use cases for Auto-GPT People are discovering all sorts of possible use cases for Auto-GPT, and we‚Äôre still at the beginning. Because it‚Äôs completely open-source, anyone can go and play with the tool. A simple example that was posted on Twitter was for ‚ÄúEcommerce-GPT,‚Äù which was given the goal to autonomously develop and run an e-commerce business with the goal of increasing net worth.
I have a Auto-GPT from @SigGravitas currently developing an E-Commerce business. It has decided to browse the internet for business ideas, saving its findings to files for reference later on.
@pinecone @OpenAI @Google @DuckDuckGo pic.twitter.com/eoUFgUDoJK &mdash; Graham Fleming (@GrahamFleming_) April 7, 2023 Another interesting example was in the world of coding. One user on Twitter came up with ‚ÄúRobo-GPT,‚Äù which is given the task of analyzing, rewriting, and saving code.
üöÄ Today, I wrote Robo-GPT, a variant of #AutoGPT ü§ñ https://t.co/qJRwEYWndP ‚ú® I tried to make the code clean and dependencies simple. It currently doesn&#39;t have as many features as Auto-GPT, but is hopefully easier to understand, run and update.
#GPT4 #AI pic.twitter.com/T09jG4D9su &mdash; Rok Strni≈°a (@RokStrnisa) April 4, 2023 There are loads more of examples, and it‚Äôs not hard to imagine how this could evolve into bots creating websites, running social media campaigns, and much more.
In addition, there are rival systems that have been developed that perform similar functions. These include Microsoft Jarvis and BabyAGI, both of which allow GPT to ‚Äúself-prompt‚Äù and act autonomously.
How to use Auto-GPT Like a lot of GitHub projects, getting Auto-GPT set up isn‚Äôt as simple as downloading a file or going to a website. There are a few important requirements needed before you get started, which include Python 3.8 (or later), an OpenAI API key , and a Pinecone API key. You‚Äôll also need an ElevenLabs API if you want the optional text-to-speech feature.
Links to those can be found on the Auto-GPT GitHub page, along with other important information. Once you have those three requirements done, click on ‚ÄúCode‚Äù and download the Zip file. Alternatively, you can access the files through the Git application.
First, open up a command-line program like PowerShell, where you‚Äôll need to type in ‚Äúgit clone https://github.com/Torantulino/Auto-GPT.git‚Äù to clone the repository.
The second step is to type in ‚Äúcd ‚ÄòAuto-GPT'‚Äù into PowerShell to navigate to the project directory. Then, type ‚Äúpip install -r requirements.txt‚Äù to install the required dependencies. Lastly, you‚Äôll need to rename the file ‚Äú.env.template‚Äù to ‚Äú.env‚Äù and fill in your OpenAI API key.
Once you have Auto-GPT installed, it‚Äôs really simple to use. It‚Äôll ask you name the bot first, followed by providing it with a goal. There are even examples of both given to lead you in the right direction.
Has Auto-GPT achieved AGI? Lots of AI enthusiasts are pointing to Auto-GPT as the first glimpse of AGI (Artificial General Intelligence).
 The reason, of course, is that Auto-GPT demonstrates the ability to reason and take multiple autonomous steps toward accomplishing goals. The addition of long- and short-term memory gives Auto-GPT permanence too, allowing it to learn new things.
Plenty of people will say that a series of linked prompts doesn‚Äôt make a system ‚Äúintelligent,‚Äù while others claim that much of human intelligence and behavior acts in a similar manner.
Whether it‚Äôs the beginning of AGI or just a particularly useful next step in standard AI, Auto-GPT certainly raises some philosophical questions about the future of the ‚Äúintelligent beings‚Äù living and acting on the internet.
Editors' Recommendations The world responds to the creator of ChatGPT being fired by his own company Apple may finally beef up Siri with AI smarts next year ChatGPT: the latest news, controversies, and tips you need to know ChatGPT‚Äôs new upgrade finally breaks the text barrier Most people distrust AI and want regulation, says new survey Artificial Intelligence Computing Microsoft Copilot and Google Duet are the two most prominent artificial intelligence assistants put out by the various tech giants since OpenAI debuted its ChatGPT chatbot in 2022. They're set to bring that powerful natural language assistance into the enterprise in ways that can enhance productivity, improve the digital fluency of workers, and leverage existing data in new and exciting ways.
But which one is best? Both offer comparable features at a comparable cost, but they aren't interchangeable and even getting access to either tool requires a bit of luck. Here's how these two awesome AI tools compare.
Computing Facebook owner Meta is working on an artificial intelligence (AI) system that it hopes will be more powerful than GPT-4, the large language model developed by OpenAI that powers ChatGPT Plus. If successful, that could add much more competition to the world of generative AI chatbots -- and potentially bring a host of serious problems along with it.
According to The Wall Street Journal, Meta is aiming to launch its new AI model in 2024. The company reportedly wants the new model to be ‚Äúseveral times more powerful‚Äù than Llama 2, the AI tool it launched as recently as July 2023.
Computing People were in awe when ChatGPT came out, impressed by its natural language abilities as an AI chatbot. But when the highly anticipated GPT-4 large language model came out, it blew the lid off what we thought was possible with AI, with some calling it the early glimpses of AGI (artificial general intelligence).
The creator of the model, OpenAI, calls it the company's "most advanced system, producing safer and more useful responses." Here's everything you need to know about it, including how to use it and what it can do.
What is GPT-4? GPT-4 is a new language model created by OpenAI that can generate text that is similar to human speech. It advances the technology used by ChatGPT, which is currently based on GPT-3.5. GPT is the acronym for Generative Pre-trained Transformer, a deep learning technology that uses artificial neural networks to write like a human.
