According to witnesses, the force of the initial impact knocked the woman into the path of the Cruise robotaxi, leaving her pinned under one of its wheels. The driver in the other car reportedly fled the scene.
The condition of the hospitalized woman was described as “critical” as of Tuesday morning.
Cruise’s robotaxi service suspended by California regulator Cruise says it’s nearing approval for mass production of futuristic robotaxi An autonomous car in San Francisco got stuck in wet concrete Prior to the incident, the two cars had been waiting side-by-side at a red traffic signal, according to video seen by the Chronicle. When it turned green, the two vehicles entered the intersection, at which point the pedestrian was struck by the other car, sending her into the path of the Cruise car, which had no one in it at the time.
In a statement to Digital Trends, Cruise confirmed that a “human-driven vehicle struck a pedestrian while traveling in the lane immediately to the left of a Cruise AV.” It described the initial impact as “severe.” As the pedestrian fell in front of the Cruise vehicle, it automatically “braked aggressively to minimize the impact.” Cruise added: “Our heartfelt concern and focus is the wellbeing of the person who was injured and we are actively working with police to help identify the responsible driver.” Images taken at the scene appear to show the rear left wheel of the Cruise car slightly raised, which corresponds with reports that the car stopped on the woman’s leg, leaving her trapped until firefighters lifted the vehicle away.
Monday’s incident follows a landmark decision in August by California’s Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), which oversees commercial passenger services, when it voted to allow Cruise and another leading AV operator — Waymo — to expand their paid ridesharing services in San Francisco to all hours of the day instead of just quieter periods.
But a few days later, regulators ordered Cruise to halve its robotaxi fleet in the city following a crash with a fire truck in which the driverless car’s passenger suffered minor injuries.
Other incidents involving the AVs have also been reported during their trial period on the city’s streets.
The regulator — the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) — said at the time that it’s investigating “recent concerning incidents” involving self-driving Cruise cars operating on the city’s public roads.
It’s too early to form any conclusions about Monday’s incident, and by all accounts, it was difficult for the Cruise vehicle to avoid. However, reports suggesting that the vehicle stopped directly on the woman’s leg are clearly troubling. A police report should confirm the details of the incident soon.

First reported by TechCrunch and later confirmed by the two auto giants, some of the 2,000 workers at Argo will transfer to Ford and Volkswagen, while others without an offer will receive a severance package. Argo’s technology is also set to end up in the possession of the two companies, though at this stage it’s not clear how it might be shared.
Cars Cruise’s autonomous cars are heading to Texas and Arizona before the end of this year.
The General Motors-owned company plans to launch ridesharing pilots in Austin and Phoenix in what will be its first expansion of the service outside of San Francisco.
Cars In what must be one of the weirder stories linked to the development of autonomous vehicles, a fleet of Cruise self-driving cars gathered together at an intersection in San Francisco earlier this week, parked up, and blocked traffic for several hours. And to be clear: No, they weren't supposed to do that.
Some observers may have thought they were witnessing the start of the robot uprising, but the real reason for the mishap was more prosaic: An issue with the platform's software.
