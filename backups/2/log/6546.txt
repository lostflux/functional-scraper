Firmware updates can fix bugs and, more importantly, unlock cool new features.
How to update your AirPods or AirPods Pro firmware How to update your AirPods Max's firmware How to check your AirPods’ firmware version Having the latest firmware will ensure you don't miss out on new features.
Spatial Audio , for example, was first made available on the expensive AirPods Max , but many AirPods Pro owners didn’t realize that a firmware update added the sound feature to their earbuds without having to spend big bucks on new pair of Max's. A firmware update is sometimes just what the doctor ordered. Here's how to update your AirPods, AirPods Pro, and AirPods Max.
Difficulty Duration What You Need A pair of AirPods, AirPods Pro, or AirPods Max An iOS device, such as iPhone or iPad How to update your AirPods or AirPods Pro firmware To take advantage of the latest features your AirPods are capable of, you need to make sure the firmware on your pods is updated. The good news is that for most users, this firmware update will happen automatically, without any intervention on your part, but frustratingly, it’s not really possible to manually update your AirPods and AirPods Pro. Here’s all you have to do: Step 1: Put your AirPods or AirPods Pro earbuds into their charging case — make sure they’re sufficiently charged, preferably full.
Step 2: Connect the case to a power source, such as a Lightning cable, or if you have a Wireless Charging Case, put the case on a charging platform or MagSafe charger.
Step 3: Place your iPhone or iPad that the AirPods are paired with close to the case.
That’s it. If there’s a firmware update available, just wait a little while, and it will be installed automatically. If it doesn’t work, try resetting the AirPods and try again.
Riley Young / Digital Trends How to update your AirPods Max's firmware Similar to the AirPods and AirPods Pro, there's really no way to force an update for the AirPods Max — it just happens automatically. You can try to initiate the update manually like this, though: Step 1: Make sure your AirPods Max are paired to your iPhone or iPad.
Step 2: Put your AirPods Max into its Smart Case and connect them to a power source. Now all you have to do is wait — give it several minutes before taking them out of the charger; you don't want to accidentally interrupt the update while it's in progress.
Step 3: Lastly, using the steps below, check if the update was successful.
How to check your AirPods’ firmware version Step 1: To check if your AirPods or AirPods Pro are running the latest firmware, first make sure your phone is running the most recent version of iOS (iOS 16.5 as of May 18, 2023).
Note: iOS 17 is in beta mode and will be released in September 2023.
Here's everything we're excited about with Apple's new mobile operating system.
Step 2: Next, go to Settings > General > About.
 You’ll probably need to scroll way down to see it, but you should see AirPods Pro, AirPods, or AirPods Max in the list. If your iPhone isn’t up to date or your headphones aren’t connected to your phone at the moment, you may not even see this setting, particularly if you have AirPods Pro.
Step 3: Tap them, and if the firmware version shows 5E135 (as of June, 2023), you have the latest update for AirPods 2, AirPods 3, AirPods Max, and AirPods Pro 1 and 2. That’s it; you’re all set. If not, follow the instructions above.

You can find bargains not just from Amazon with its Prime Big Deal Days 2023 (officially set to start tomorrow), but also from other retailers who are trying to take advantage of the increased online shopping activity. Here are our top picks, and if you see something that you like, you should complete the purchase right away because stocks may sell out soon.
Apple AirPods Pro (1st Gen, Refurbished) -- $153, was $220 The first-generation Apple AirPods Pro offer active noise cancellation to block external noise, transparency mode to let you hear your surroundings without having to take them off, support for spatial audio with dynamic head tracking, and a battery that can last up to 4.5 hours on a single charge and more than 24 hours with their charging case.

Audio / Video AirPods are pretty great, and they really launched the use of wireless earbuds and headphones in the market. Of course, they are a bit on the expensive side, especially if you pick up some of the more expensive ones, like the AirPods Pro 2 or the even more expensive AirPods Max. Luckily, Amazon has decided to have a second big Prime Day 2023 event, so there are a lot of great Apple AirPods deals you can take advantage of, although you will need to be an Amazon Prime member to see the best deals. Luckily, there is a 30-day trial you can sign up for, so now's the time to do it if you haven't already! On the other hand, you don't have to necessarily be an Amazon Prime member to take advantage of Prime Day deals on AirPods because we're already seeing a lot of other retailers come out with their own sales. In fact, we're seeing things like Walmart's October Rollbacks sale, which is functioning as its own Walmart Prime Day sale, and even Apple is getting into the mix with its own deals. Either way, there are a lot of great deals on the AirPods you can take advantage of, so you're essentially spoiled for choice! Even so, we've collected some of the best deals we've found so far below, and be sure to check back regularly as we find more.
