 Now, there’s a new headache for the artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot, as it’s been found it has a tendency to send you to malware websites that can infect your PC.
The discovery was made by antivirus firm Malwarebytes, which discussed the incident in a blog post.
 According to the company, Bing Chat is displaying malware advertisements that send users to malicious websites instead of filtering them out.
Malwarebytes When using Bing Chat, you can ask the chatbot to find information, websites, apps, and other things for you. Sometimes, it will provide a link in the chat. Almost from Bing Chat’s first release, Microsoft has been inserting adverts into these links, much like how a Google search places ads above initial results.
The problem, though, is that it is very easy for bad actors to buy an advert in order to promote a website that masquerades as a legitimate destination. If you’re not careful, you can end up falling victim to this bait and switch.
OpenAI’s new tool can spot fake AI images, but there’s a catch This powerful ChatGPT feature is back from the dead — with a few key changes Microsoft accidentally released 38TB of private data in a major leak Advertising malicious websites Jacob Roach / Digital Trends Here’s how it works. In the blog post, Malwarebytes detailed how you could ask Bing Chat to download a popular IP scanning app that is used by system admins. Bing Chat provided a link to the app’s official website, but hovering over the link actually showed two results: the real website, with a malicious advert placed right above it.
If you didn’t look too closely — or weren’t familiar with the app’s official website address — you might not realize that the first result would take you to a deceptive website.
On further analysis, Malwarebytes found that the fake website redirected visitors to a second site that possessed a very similar web address to the real app’s official URL. It then prompted users to download malware that could damage their computers.
The incident suggests that Microsoft could be doing a lot more to protect its users from malicious adverts that are served up through Bing Chat. For the time being, you should be very careful when clicking links provided by Bing Chat. It might be best to stick to a standard search engine and install an ad blocker to prevent malicious adverts from ever reaching you.
Editors' Recommendations Hackers are using this incredibly sneaky trick to hide malware Bing Chat just beat a security check to stop hackers and spammers Update your Apple devices now to fix these dangerous exploits This dangerous new Mac malware steals your credit card info GPT-4: how to use the AI chatbot that puts ChatGPT to shame Artificial Intelligence Cybersecurity Microsoft Software Tech News Computing The Zoom video-calling app has just added its own “AI Companion” assistant that integrates artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMs) from ChatGPT maker OpenAI and Facebook owner Meta. The tool is designed to help you catch up on meetings you missed and devise quick responses to chat messages.
Zoom’s developer says the AI Companion “empowers individuals by helping them be more productive, connect and collaborate with teammates, and improve their skills.” Computing GPT-4 -- the large language model (LLM) that powers ChatGPT Plus -- may soon take on a new role as an online moderator, policing forums and social networks for nefarious content that shouldn’t see the light of day. That’s according to a new blog post from ChatGPT developer OpenAI, which says this could offer “a more positive vision of the future of digital platforms.” By enlisting artificial intelligence (AI) instead of human moderators, OpenAI says GPT-4 can enact “much faster iteration on policy changes, reducing the cycle from months to hours.” As well as that, “GPT-4 is also able to interpret rules and nuances in long content policy documentation and adapt instantly to policy updates, resulting in more consistent labeling,” OpenAI claims.
Computing It's common knowledge -- Macs are less prone to malware than their Windows counterparts. That still holds true today, but the rise of ChatGPT and other AI tools is challenging the status quo, with even the FBI warning of its far-reaching implications for cybersecurity.
That may be why software developer Macpaw launched its own cybersecurity division -- dubbed Moonlock -- specifically to fight Mac malware. We spoke to Oleg Stukalenko, Lead Product Manager at Moonlock, to find out whether Mac malware is on the rise, and if ChatGPT could give hackers a massive advantage over everyday users.
