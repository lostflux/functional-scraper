Why trust us? Discovery Plus Free Trial: Stream for a week for free By Andrew Morrisey Close We’ve reached a point where there are almost too many streaming services to choose from. That makes a streaming service free trial worth every penny it saves. You can give a service or platform a try before spending any of your hard-earned money. A Discovery Plus free trial is one that may be of particular interest to anyone looking to break in one of the best TVs or one of the best streaming devices , as Discovery is known for its sprawling, adventurous content that’s almost tailor-made to suit modern home theaters. A Discovery Plus subscription gets you access to shows such as 90-Day Fiancé, Dirty Jobs, and Gold Rush , and a Discovery Plus free trial gets you access to the full Discovery Plus library to give it a try before you spend on the premium subscription. Read onward for more details.
Is there a Discovery Plus free trial? Can you get Discovery Plus for free? Are there any Discovery Plus deals? Is there a Discovery Plus free trial? Image used with permission by copyright holder There is a Discovery Plus free trial, and if things like a Disney Plus free trial and a Peacock TV free trial are of interest to you, it’s worth pouncing on. The Discovery Plus free trial does consist of signing up for the paid service, at which point you’re given seven days of free access to the entire Discovery Plus library of content. You have the full seven days to enjoy all of the Discovery Plus content you like, and you can cancel with no financial commitment within those seven days. If you don’t cancel within those seven days, your credit card will be billed $4.99 per month or $6.99 per month, depending on which Discovery Plus tier you choose at signup.
A Discovery Plus free trial is worth pouncing on, as Discovery Plus is one of the best streaming services , and it’s full of some of the best content to watch right now. Both a Discovery Plus subscription and a Discovery Plus free trial get you access to originals such as Love Off the Grid, Naked and Afraid of Love, and The Haunted Museum , as well as new and classic series from HGTV, Food Network, TLC, and more. This content rivals things such as Disney Plus and HBO Max and even surpasses them if you’re into more documentary and reality-based programming.
Can you get Discovery Plus for free? Discovery Plus is available for free in certain situations. One of those is if you’re a Verizon Unlimited customer and you meet the requirements. If this is the case, you can get Discovery Plus for free for six months. This essentially is an extended version of the Discovery Plus free trial, which is a solid seven days of access to the Discovery Plus catalog, and which can be accessed from various outside platforms, such as Amazon Prime Video, through the Discovery Plus app on an AppleTV , and can even be accessed through other streaming devices.
Alternatively, you might consider some of the other services with offers, like the Amazon Prime Video free trial , HBO Max free trial , the Showtime free trial , or even the Sling TV free trial.
 They’re certainly not the same as Discovery Plus, but they offer plenty of content to watch, especially on top of a subscription you already have! Are there any Discovery Plus deals? Image used with permission by copyright holder Discovery Plus is fairly priced at just $5 per month with ads and $9 per month for its ad-free service. However, it discounts its services substantially for both students and.
 If you fall into any of those categories as a subscriber, you can get the Discovery Plus Ad-Lite subscription plan for just $2.99 per month. This is a 40% savings compared to its regular price.
Editors' Recommendations Netflix free trial: Can you stream for free in 2023? Hulu Free Trial: Stream for a month without paying a dime NordVPN Free Trial: Try the service for free for a month Wix Free Trial: Can you build a website for free? Amazon Prime free trial: Get an entire month for free Audio / Video Entertainment Cheapest Prices Free Trial Deals Marketing will make or break your new venture. A lot more goes into running a traditional or ecommerce business than just registering a new domain, making a website -- even with a Wix free trial -- and calling it a day. Potential customers must be made aware that your business exists, and for that to happen in the digital age, you need to make use of modern online marketing tools. That's a broad field, though, encompassing keyword research, search engine optimization, data analytics, and other elements that can be pretty technical (not to mention intimidating) to the uninitiated. Enter Semrush, one of the best online marketing suites that makes all that stuff easy -- but it's not free. Maybe you want to give it a try before signing up for a premium subscription? If that's the case and you are looking for a Semrush free trial, then you're in luck. Read on. We have all the details for you, below.
Is there a Semrush free trial? Deals Through E-learning, or remote learning, you can study, research, and experience a traditional school curriculum, from the comfort of your home. Imagine learning entirely new skills or abilities? Virtual learning has evolved quite a bit over the last few years, and whether you’re a teacher, a student, a parent, or somebody just looking to grow, the best online learning platforms are worthy of consideration. Skillshare is a regular on this list, as it offers classes in subjects that range from animation to photography, and from business analytics to marketing. But these services and platforms can be expensive, so it warrants giving them a try before spending any of your hard-earned cash. A Skillshare free trial is a good way to dive into the full depth of Skillshare’s offerings. A Skillshare free trial, in fact, will allow you to explore thousands of hands-on creative classes and see if it’s the right platform for you to put your money into.
Is there a Skillshare free trial? There is a Skillshare free trial, and unlike a MasterClass free trial, which is really just a 30-day money back guarantee if you don’t like the platform once you’ve paid, with a Skillshare free trial you get 7 days of access without having to make any sort of payment, though you do need to put a payment method on file. Like all of the best free trials, a Skillshare free trial is truly free, with only the commitment of having to create an account. This will get you instant access to thousands of classes, and with one full month to explore it all, there’s no hurry to rush through anything and plenty of time to learn at your own pace.
Deals You don't have to rush to download music to an MP3 or media player anymore. With the right service, you can stream any song, any album, and pretty much from any device from the cloud. Sometimes, even if you don't have an active internet connection, you can download that content to listen to offline -- like if you're going hiking or on a cruise out in the ocean. Nothing makes this reality more apparent than the plethora of music streaming services available now; Apple Music, Spotify, Pandora, and even YouTube are popular platforms people use to stream tunes, but we'd be remiss if we didn't also mention one of the biggest ones: Amazon Music. You're likely already familiar with Amazon Prime Video, but this online retail giant is also host to one of the most popular music streaming apps. Just like Prime Video, Amazon Music isn't free, but if you want to sign up and give it a listen without paying, read on. You'll find everything you need to know about the Amazon Music free trial below.
Is there an Amazon Music free trial? Yes, there is an Amazon Music free trial, and quite a generous one at that: New subscribers who sign up can enjoy 30 days of Amazon Music totally free, which is one of the better trial offers we've seen. Better still, this trial period applies to the full Amazon Music Unlimited experience, letting you enjoy more than 90 million songs ad-free. You do need to enter your payment information, but you probably already have an Amazon account, so your info is likely on file. All you have to do is sign in, start your trial, and you're ready to listen.
