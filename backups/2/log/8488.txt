Why trust us? Google Nest Thermostat price slashed under $100 By Aaron Mamiit Close Google For those who have been waiting for Nest thermostat deals to get the temperature-setting smart home device with a discount, now’s the time to pull the trigger as Walmart has reduced the price of the Google Nest Thermostat to below $100. From its original price of $130, it’s down to a very affordable $93, for savings of $37. There’s a catch though — this price cut only applies to the Snow color option. If that’s fine, then don’t hesitate to push through with the purchase right now because tomorrow may already be too late.
Why you should buy the Google Nest Thermostat The Google Nest Thermostat is in our roundup of the best smart thermostats as our top budget option, because you’ll be enjoying a host of smart functions at an affordable cost. Once it’s up and running, you and your family members will be able to control your home’s temperature from anywhere through the Google Home app on your smartphone , though you can also simply swipe on the device’s touch bar. There’s also the option to use voice commands for any changes through Google Assistant or Amazon’s Alexa on smart speakers and smart displays.
 The Google Nest Thermostat can turn itself down when it detects that you’ve left the house to save on energy costs, and you can also create schedules of your own.
In addition to these features, the Google Nest Thermostat is designed so that you’ll be able to install it yourself. Perhaps less important but still significant is the fact that the smart thermostat looks very stylish, so it won’t be sticking out after you’ve carefully selected the aesthetics of your home.
The Google Nest Thermostat will provide your family with a lot of benefits for its affordable price of just $93, following a $37 discount on its sticker price of $130. The potential electricity savings alone makes this smart home device a must-buy. You’re going to have to hurry if you’re interested though, because there’s a chance that the offer is already expired by tomorrow. Add the Google Nest Thermostat to your cart and check out immediately to make sure that you get it for less than $100.
Editors' Recommendations Best smart plug Black Friday deals: Get connected from just $10 The best early Keurig Black Friday deals — from $35 Best Waterpik Black Friday deals on water flossers and toothbrushes The best KitchenAid mixer Black Friday deals (and accessories from $17) The best Vitamix blender Black Friday deals — from just $125 Deals Google Nest Deals Vacuums are expensive. Feature-rich vacuums, especially wet-dry vacuums that can handle all spills, are even pricier. Recognizing that there’s a gap in the market for more affordable options, Eureka has delivered one for under $200. Get excited. They're perfect for cleaning sticky messes, whether you made them, your kids, or your pets. But the most important distinction is that wet and dry vacuums can vacuum and mop all in one go, and you don't have to swap out devices, attachments, or anything else. At least, that's the case with Eureka's excellent NEW400 wet and dry all-in-one vacuum. It's even self-propelled to make it easier on you -- and it takes less effort to glide around your floors.
Here's the best part of all, though. For Black Friday, running from November 17 to November 27, you can save big on the Eureka NEW400, which is discounted to $140 instead of its normal $200 price. That's a total savings of $60, but really, even more, considering you're not having to buy a separate vacuum and mop. You can grab that deal below right now or keep reading to learn a little more about what the NEW400 has to offer.
