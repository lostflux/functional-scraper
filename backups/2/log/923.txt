It's now jointly owned by AT&T and private equity firm TPG Inc., if you're concerned about such things. That new venture means that we no longer have insight into how many subscribers DirecTV Stream has, but it's believed to be the smallest of the live streaming services in the United States. (The last time we got numbers was at the end of 2020, when the service was at about 656,000 subscribers, or about half that of Fubo, or no bigger than 13 percent of YouTube TV's base.) In any event, you're looking to cut the cable cord, DirecTV Stream is on more service to consider among others such as Hulu With Live TV, Sling TV, and the aforementioned YouTube TV.
Entertainment The first Sunday in November means the best distance runners in the world will convene in the Big Apple for the 2023 TCS New York City Marathon. Residents can watch the marathon on ABC starting at 8 a.m. ET on November 5. Pre-race coverage begins at 7:00 a.m. ET and continues through the post-race interviews until 1 p.m. ET. National coverage of the marathon airs on ESPN2 and the ESPN app from 8 a.m. ET to 11:30 a.m. ET.
2023 marks the 52nd edition of the New York City Marathon. An estimated 50,000 runners, from professional runners and athletes to celebrities and New York City residents, plan on participating in the 2023 race. The male and female winners from 2022 – Evans Chebet and Sharon Lokedi of Kenya – will be in this year's field to defend their respective titles.
Entertainment Lawman: Bass Reeves is arriving on Paramount+ in November, and to no one's surprise, it's the new original series written and created by Taylor Sheridan, the guy behind almost all of the streamer's high-profile shows. Just to illustrate that point, Sheridan created or co-created Mayor of Kingstown, 1883, Tulsa King, 1923, Special Ops: Lioness, and a little show for The Paramount Network called Yellowstone. That means a sizable audience is going to be checking out Sheridan's take on the life of the first black Deputy U.S. Marshal west of the Mississippi River.
For comedy fans, Paramount+ is premiering the original movie, Good Burger 2, while cinema lovers will be able to dive into all three of The Godfather films and a wide assortment of modern and classic flicks. That's in addition to Paramount+'s live sporting events which will be streamed throughout the month.
