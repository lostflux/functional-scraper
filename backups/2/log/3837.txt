Huge shout out to the Wired audience.
It's a whole nother level of challenge for me as a freestyler to try to be coherent when answering complex questions, and try to, you know, be fluent when expressing more complicated ideas like this in a narrative kind of way.
So, super fun for me.
Hope y'all enjoyed it.
Thank you so much for being here.
We love you.
Thank you.
