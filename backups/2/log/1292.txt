Home Home & Office Home Entertainment TVs The best OLED TVs you can buy Written by Taylor Clemons, Staff Writer Oct. 9, 2023 at 11:03 a.m. PT Nina Raemont View now View at Amazon View now View at Best Buy View now View at Best Buy View now View at Samsung View now View at Best Buy An OLED TV is often considered the crown jewel of any home theater or living room. The unique construction of OLED panels features individually lit pixels, which allow the TV to create deep, inky blacks, bright whites, and crisp details. The organic substrates also allow for a wide, vibrant color range for more lifelike images. An OLED TV is a perfect upgrade for movie buffs and sports fans.
The downside? OLED TVs are more expensive than other TVs on the market since their panels are expensive to produce and the TVs contain fairly new technology. Most models you can find are either from LG or Sony -- Vizio does offer a few OLED models, but they aren't quite the same caliber. Samsung also introduced its first OLED television, the S95B, to compete with LG and Sony for brand dominance.
My choice for the best OLED TV is the Sony A95L for its updated QD-OLED panel, ambient light sensor, and multiple stand options. You can keep reading below to find out more about the Sony A95L as well as my other picks for the best OLED TVs.

ZDNET's Rebecca Isaacs got some hands-on experience with the Sony A95L , and praised its support for Google Duo and Zoom for video calls to help keep you in touch with family, friends, and coworkers. It supports Dolby Vision for enhanced color and detailing to give you an almost unparalleled viewing experience for movies, online videos, and TV shows.
It also uses Sony's Acoustic Surface Audio+ technology to turn the entire screen into a speaker for near-perfect audio and video syncing as well as sound that follows the on-screen action. Movie buffs will love the IMAX Enhanced and Netflix Adaptive Calibrated modes, which allow you to see your favorite movies and shows as their creators intended. It also works with VRR technology for console gaming to prevent screen tearing and stuttering.

The TV uses Dolby Vision IQ HDR for enhanced detailing, color, and contrast as well as Dolby Atmos for virtual surround sound for more immersive audio while watching movies, online videos, and TV shows. The M Series is also LG's first all-wireless model, using a small relay box to send video signals from your playback devices and game consoles to the TV itself for an ultra-clean look. The wireless receiver is capable of providing video in up to 4K resolution and up to 120Hz for smooth motion during sports, gaming, and action scenes. However, be prepared to shell out top-dollar for the LG evo M Series, as the 97-inch model tops out at $30,000. The 77-inch version, which is the smallest available, is a more reasonable $5,000.

You'll still get excellent picture quality with true blacks for enhanced contrast, as well as Dolby Vision IQ HDR support for better detailing and color volume. The B3 also works with Dolby Atmos for virtual surround sound as well as both Alexa and Hey Google for hands-free voice controls. The B3 is preloaded with a suite of popular streaming apps like Netflix, Disney+, and Prime Video so you can start watching your favorite shows and movies right out of the box; and with the webOS platform, you'll get access to thousands more to turn your TV into the ultimate entertainment hub.

Along with excellent picture quality with the OLED panel, it uses Dolby Atmos and Samsung's Object Tracking Sound+ technology to provide virtual surround sound that follows the on-screen action; which is great news for gamers who don't like to play while wearing bulky headsets. The Samsung Game Hub gives you access to cloud gaming platforms like GeForce NOW and Xbox GamePass so you can play old favorites and new releases without needing to buy a physical copy or downloading large game files.
More: The Samsung S95C is one of the best OLED TVs yet It also lets you monitor frame rate and input response times to let you catch and address issues before they ruin your gaming session. ZDNET's June Wan was able to test the S95C in person, and praised its compatibility with the OneConnect system which allows you to use a single cable to connect all of your game consoles and playback devices to your TV; this helps keep power and HDMI cables from getting tangled and making your gaming space feel cluttered and messy.

It's available in both 42- and 48-inch screen sizes, perfect for bedrooms, apartments, and dorm rooms. And even with the smaller screen, you'll still get excellent picture quality from the OLED panel, 120Hz refresh rate, and support for Dolby Vision HDR. You'll also get Sony's Acoustic Surface Audio+ technology for near-perfect audio and video syncing as well as sound that follows the on-screen action.
The A90K uses the Google TV platform to give you a suite of preloaded apps like Netflix, Hulu, and Prime Video so you can start streaming right out of the box.

This gives you near-perfect audio and video syncing as well as sound that follows the on-screen action.

How did we choose these OLED TVs? While researching and testing each of the OLED TVs featured on this list, I and other ZDNET experts kept these criteria in mind: Price: While OLED TVs are more expensive than their QLED or LED counterparts, there are still options out there for customers looking to save a bit of money while upgrading their home theater. I did my best to include a variety of OLED models at different price points to fit a wide range of budgets.
Connectivity: Your new TV should be able to connect with all of your game consoles and playback devices like cable or satellite boxes, Blu-Ray and DVD players, and home audio equipment. Each OLED TV on this list features an array of input ports for physical connections as well as support for Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, AirPlay, and/or Chromecast.
HDR: An OLED TV can provide an almost unparalleled viewing experience due to the fact that the panels are built with self-lit pixels in order to create true blacks and sharper contrast. I've ensured that each model on this list also supports a variety of HDR codecs for enhancing detailing and color for even better picture quality.
Audio: A great picture doesn't mean much if your TV's audio isn't up to snuff. Each OLED TV on this list has been confirmed to support soundbars and other home audio equipment as well as virtual surround sound codecs like Dolby Atmos.
What is an OLED TV? An OLED TV is a model that uses specialized, organic substrates and individually lit LEDs to create stark contrast, brighter and richer colors, as well as crisper details than what you can get with an LED or QLED television. The technology is best appreciated by movie and TV buffs who want to experience Hollywood classics and the latest blockbusters as their creators intended. OLED TVs are also ideal for console gamers looking to embrace native 4K graphics.
What is the difference between OLED and QLED TV? OLED and QLED use different TV technologies, and their main differences include the black levels, color, and contrast. OLED TVs are better at black levels, while QLED TVs are better with brightness and usually cost less than OLED TVs.

Is an OLED TV worth it? An OLED TV is absolutely worth it if picture quality is at the top of your "must-have" feature list when shopping for a new TV. An OLED panel can create incredibly vibrant colors and crisp details that breathe new life into classic media and show off the technical skills used to create new movies and shows. Even if you aren't a movie buff, you can still get a ton of value out of an OLED TV, since they have a longer lifespan than other models. Also, an OLED TV can sort of future-proof your living room or home theater, since it will take a while for LED and QLED TV models to catch up to the quality you can get from an OLED version.
Why are OLED TVs so expensive? The technology behind OLED TVs is still new and more complicated than what you'd find in an LED panel. This makes it more expensive to produce, so higher manufacturing costs get passed down as high retail prices to consumers. Thankfully, companies like LG and Sony are finding more streamlined and cost-effective ways to produce OLED panels, making them a bit more affordable than before. However, they are still much more expensive than their LED and QLED counterparts.
Are there alternative OLED TVs worth considering? Sony and LG used to be the only brands that offered OLED models, but Samsung and even Vizio have started to release their own. Here's a short list of other OLED models that are also worth considering: Buy Now LG OLED Flex The LG OLED Flex is a 42-inch smart TV that can be used as either a traditional flat-panel or as a curved screen. With the push of a button, the screen automatically curves to reduce overhead glare and provide better viewing angles, especially if you want to use the Flex as a gaming monitor.
