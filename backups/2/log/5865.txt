Today, the Star Wars brand is still led by the ongoing movie series. Each Star Wars movie release stirs frantic buzz across the world, and with Disney+, that even extends to television now with series like The Mandalorian.
It seeps into video games, too, and although there are a lot of bad Star Wars games, recent ones like Star Wars Jedi: Survivor prove they can be good. Let’s take a look at the best Star Wars games, ranging from third-person shooters to full-blown role-playing games.

There are lots to choose from, but for this list, we've rounded up the very best multiplayer games available on the PS5 right now.
Gaming Even with the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X offering up next-level visuals, PCs remain the home for high-end gaming for many players. Games usually look their best on PC, and there's a massive selection to choose from. From indie darlings to AAA blockbusters, our roundup of the best PC games has something for everyone.
RPGs Baldur's Gate 3 Gaming Bethesda is one of the rare cases of a game developer finding so much success that it branched out to become one of the biggest publishers in the Western gaming market. While not quite as gigantic as the likes of Activision or EA, Bethesda has a great stable of developers, itself included, that have made some of the most ambitious games on the market. Whether it's the cutting-edge technology coming out of ID Software, the high-octane FPS action of Machine Games, or even the more experimental titles from Arkane, Bethesda's name is attached to far more than just its high-profile RPG series.
Since it was acquired by Microsoft, all of Bethesda's games, including the games made by the studios under it, will be console-exclusive to the X-box platform moving forward. However, there is a long history of games already released for multiple platforms, and between all the studios Bethesda is in charge of, there are games of all types to check out. You will obviously know the major players here, such as The Elder Scrolls and Fallout, but there are way more Bethesda games that are just as good. That's why we've rounded up this list of the best Bethesda games of all time.
