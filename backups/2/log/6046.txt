Wonder By Billy Givens Close Super Mario Bros. Wonder is overflowing with things to collect, secrets to uncover, and plenty of new mechanics to discover and use. Among the fresh additions to the franchise in this outing is its badge system , which allows you to select a perk of sorts at the beginning of a match. However, to use the badges, you’ll first need to find them throughout Super Mario Bros. Wonder ‘s various challenges and Poplin Shops. When it comes to unlocking the final badge, though, you’ll have to put in quite a bit of extra work. Here’s what you’ll need to do to score the quirky “Sound Off?” badge, which has a pretty funny and unique action attached to it.
How to get the final badge To get the final badge in Super Mario Bros. Wonder , you’ll need to unlock a very well-hidden secret final level called The Final-Final Test Badge Marathon. Based on our testing, unlocking this ultra-challenging stage requires you to meet the following criteria: Collect every Wonder Seed Collect every 10-flower coin Grab the top of every flagpole Complete all other Special World stages Nintendo This secret final level will test the mettle of even platformer veterans, so be prepared for quite a challenge on your quest to score the final badge. You’ll have to make use of everything you’ve learned throughout all of Super Mario Bros. Wonder ‘s previous levels and pull it all off with extreme precision. As a reward, though, the “Sound Off?” badge will be yours.
So what exactly does the “Sound Off?” badge do? Well, it’s not going to provide you with any useful abilities that help you complete a level. Instead, it makes all the sound effects in the game even wackier than before by changing them entirely to a cappella versions. In other words, if funny mouth noises get you laughing, you’ll love this one. Otherwise, you’re probably better off sticking with badges that can actually help you.

Switch OLED for Black Friday Mario Kart 8 Deluxe’s final DLC brings the series most iconic track The best video games of October 2023: Mario, Spider-Man 2, and more How-To Guides Nintendo Nintendo Switch Gaming Super Mario Bros. Wonder's defining gimmick is its series of Wonder Effects. A Wonder Flower is hidden somewhere on almost every level and, once found, radically switches up what is going on within that stage. Some expand on ideas the stage was already exploring, while others are wildly unpredictable, giving players something they were not expecting at all.
There are over 69 stages with Wonder Effects that players can see while playing through the story of Super Mario Bros. Wonder, but 10 of those Wonder Effects effects stood out the most during my playthrough. By order of appearance, these are my 10 favorite Wonder Effects in Super Mario Bros. Wonder, which showcase just how inventive and unpredictable the platformer is.

As our glowing review outlined, it’s a highly polished 2D platformer that’s approachable for anyone to play and elicits a joyous and vibrant sense of wonder. But for me, what makes Super Mario Bros. Wonder special aren't so much the wild Wonder effects or elephant transformations. It's the subtle touches. These elements might not be immediately noticeable or relevant to most, but they all work together to create an experience that’s a step above most other platformers.
Changes enhance enjoyment Super Mario Bros. Wonder isn’t afraid to show that it’s different from previous Mario games through small moments and changes. One instance that illustrates this early on is in one of the first Bowser Jr. fights. It starts like all his New Super Mario Bros. boss fights do, with him getting in his shell and spinning toward Mario. At first, I was disappointed that Nintendo was just doing the same thing again, but after the first hit, that changed. Bowser Jr. activates a Wonder effect and changes in size for the following two stages of his fight. It's a moment of surprise that subverts my expectations, which are based on decades of Mario games. This is a small moment and reference that many Super Mario Bros. Wonder players probably won’t even internalize. Still, it is a smart way to show how the platformer differs from what came before.
Gaming Super Mario Bros. Wonder is taking the series back to its 2D roots with a new and exciting art style and a ton of new mechanics. Alongside new power-ups and badges, this title has perhaps the largest amount of collectibles and hidden secrets of any game in the series. Between all the Wonder Seeds, Wonder Flowers, Flower Coins, and more, there's no shortage of things to do as you run, jump, and flip your way through all the various worlds. Among all the playable characters to choose from, one non-playable character makes his triumphant return. Captain Toad has managed to make his way to the Flower Kingdom, but this intrepid explorer is not so easy to find. Each time you interact with him, he will reward you with some Flower Coins and a hint at an upcoming world, so let's hunt down all his locations in Super Mario Wonder.
All Captain Toad locations Captain Toad appears in five unique spots on the Super Mario Bros. Wonder world map. Talking to him at each spot will give you a little bit more of his story, plus the aforementioned rewards.
