Generative AI burst onto the scene with the launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT chatbot almost a year ago. The tool is extremely adept at conversing in a very natural, human-like way, but to gain that ability it had to be trained on masses of data scraped from the web.
Similar generative AI tools are also capable of producing images from text prompts , but like ChatGPT, they’re trained by scraping images published on the web.
This powerful ChatGPT feature is back from the dead — with a few key changes ChatGPT’s new upgrade finally breaks the text barrier GPT-4: how to use the AI chatbot that puts ChatGPT to shame It means artists and photographers are having their work used — without consent or compensation — by tech firms to build out their generative AI tools.
To fight this, a team of researchers has developed a tool called Nightshade that’s capable of confusing the training model, causing it to spit out erroneous images in response to prompts.
Outlined recently in an article by MIT Technology Review , Nightshade “poisons” the training data by adding invisible pixels to a piece of art before it’s uploaded to the web.
“Using it to ‘poison’ this training data could damage future iterations of image-generating AI models, such as DALL-E, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion, by rendering some of their outputs useless — dogs become cats, cars become cows, and so forth,” MIT’s report said, adding that the research behind Nightshade has been submitted for peer review.
While the image-generating tools are already impressive and are continuing to improve, the way they’re trained has proved controversial, with many of the tools’ creators currently facing lawsuits from artists claiming that their work has been used without permission or payment.
University of Chicago professor Ben Zhao, who led the research team behind Nightshade, said that such a tool could help shift the balance of power back to artists, firing a warning shot at tech firms that ignore copyright and intellectual property.
“The data sets for large AI models can consist of billions of images, so the more poisoned images can be scraped into the model, the more damage the technique will cause,” MIT Technology Review said in its report.
When it releases Nightshade, the team is planning to make it open source so that others can refine it and make it more effective.
Aware of its potential to disrupt, the team behind Nightshade said it should be used as “a last defense for content creators against web scrapers” that disrespect their rights.
In a bid to deal with the issue, DALL-E creator OpenAI recently began allowing artists to remove their work from its training data, but the process has been described as extremely onerous as it requires the artist to send a copy of every single image they want removed, together with a description of that image, with each request requiring its own application.
Making the removal process considerably easier might go some way to discouraging artists from opting to use a tool like Nightshade, which could cause many more issues for OpenAI and others in the long run.
Editors' Recommendations OpenAI’s new tool can spot fake AI images, but there’s a catch Meta just created a Snoop Dogg AI for your text RPGs Most people distrust AI and want regulation, says new survey Zoom adds ChatGPT to help you catch up on missed calls Google Bard could soon become your new AI life coach Artificial Intelligence Tech News Computing GPT-4 -- the large language model (LLM) that powers ChatGPT Plus -- may soon take on a new role as an online moderator, policing forums and social networks for nefarious content that shouldn’t see the light of day. That’s according to a new blog post from ChatGPT developer OpenAI, which says this could offer “a more positive vision of the future of digital platforms.” By enlisting artificial intelligence (AI) instead of human moderators, OpenAI says GPT-4 can enact “much faster iteration on policy changes, reducing the cycle from months to hours.” As well as that, “GPT-4 is also able to interpret rules and nuances in long content policy documentation and adapt instantly to policy updates, resulting in more consistent labeling,” OpenAI claims.
Computing OpenAI might be preparing the next version of its DALL-E AI text-to-image generator with a series of alpha tests that have now been leaked to the public, according to the Decoder.
An anonymous leaker on Discord shared details about his experience, having access to the upcoming OpenAI image model being referred to as DALL-E 3. He first appeared in May, telling the interest-based Discord channel that he was part of an alpha test for OpenAI, trying out a new AI image model. He shared the images he generated at the time.
Computing OpenAI, the creator of the wildly popular artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot ChatGPT, has shut down the tool it developed to detect content created by AI rather than humans. The tool, dubbed AI Classifier, has been shuttered just six months after it was launched due to its “low rate of accuracy,” OpenAI said.
Since ChatGPT and rival services have skyrocketed in popularity, there has been a concerted pushback from various groups concerned about the consequences of unchecked AI usage. For one thing, educators have been particularly troubled by the potential for students to use ChatGPT to write their essays and assignments, then pass them off as their own.
