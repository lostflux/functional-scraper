By Sam Hill Close Hogwarts Legacy is the latest and greatest adventure in the magical Harry Potter universe. Set in the 1800s, the story focuses on a generic fifth-year student who’s tasked with taking down a brewing Goblin rebellion in-between their school duties. For Potterheads of all ages, a game that allows them to traverse the halls of Hogwarts, learn their favorite spells from the books and films, and fight enemies like dark wizards, trolls, and dragons is an absolute dream.
The game launched on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X , and PC in February. While reviews were mixed across the board, longtime fans jumped into the wizarding world in droves — over 15 million copies of the game have been sold to date. Unfortunately, players on the top-tier consoles were the only ones who had access to the game for a while. Instead of launching on all platforms simultaneously, Hogwarts Legacy’ s release has been staggered.
The game was released for last-gen consoles PS4 and Xbox One on May 5, nearly three months after the initial launch date.

Developers pushed back last-gen versions of the game in order to ensure the best possible performance on consoles with lesser performance specs than powerhouses like the PS5 and Xbox Series X. This has become an unfortunate trend for Switch owners in regard to multiplatform games, with games like Marvel’s Midnight Suns getting its Switch port canceled altogether. Nintendo recently announced that it isn’t planning on launching a console upgrade in the next year , but fans are hoping that the next-gen Switch will have a lot better specs.

How Nintendo Switch Vouchers work Gaming Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars is getting a full-on remake for the Nintendo Switch -- and it's coming this year.

Super Mario RPG (Remake) Trailer | Nintendo Direct 2023 Gaming As you would expect from a witch or wizard still going through school in Hogwarts Legacy, your created character still has a lot to learn in the wizarding world. Thankfully you don't have to go to class in order to expand your arsenal of magical abilities thanks to the Talent system. Talents may as well just be called skills since they function just like skills do in any other RPG.
However, Hogwarts Legacy is the kind of RPG that packs tons of Talents into it, forcing you to pick and choose which ones you want to invest your precious points into. While some will depend on what type of witch or wizard you want to play as (so don't forget to consider the best traits as well), there are a few that stand above the rest regardless of how you like to play. Here are 10 of the best Talents in Hogwarts Legacy.
