As expected, the game doesn’t specify where to find Capture Points, and even if you do stumble upon one, claiming it can be a tricky task. Here’s what you need to know about claiming Capture Points in Fortnite.
Where to find Capture Points How to claim Capture Points Where to find Capture Points Image used with permission by copyright holder Capture Points are located in the center of each main hub across the map. These hubs include: Breakwater Bay The Citadel Anvil Square Brutal Bastion Lonely Labs Shattered Slabs Frenzy Fields Faulty Splits Slappy Shores Upon arriving at a hub, you’ll see a flag on the mini-map corresponding to the location of the Capture Point. If a Capture Point flag icon is pure white, it means you can claim it. A green checkmark indicates it’s been claimed already. Keep in mind that Capture Points spawn at main hubs each game, so there’s no need to rely on luck to come across one.
How to claim Capture Points Claiming a Capture Point is as easy as standing in the circle surrounding the flag. Doing so works as it does in other games, wherein a circle will fill in the center of the screen as long as you remain inside the radius. To make your life easier, we recommend bringing a squad along to protect each other as you capture the flag.
In terms of the quest, we advise landing at a hub far away from the path of the Battle Bus to increase your chances of survival. The weekly quest requires you to secure many flags, but since progress is tracked cumulatively, you don’t have to claim all Capture Points in one match, so it won’t harm your chances at winning Fortnite.
Editors' Recommendations The best Call of Duty games, ranked The best Warzone FR Avancer loadout How to gain Inspiration Points in Baldur’s Gate 3 Call of Duty: Warzone tips and tricks Fortnite Artifact Axe: how to destroy stones and best location Fortnite PC Gaming Gaming Most of the time in BattleBit Remastered, you'll probably be more focused on just trying to survive than anything else. This massive first-person shooter takes all the best elements of the Battlefield franchise, such as the giant, destructible maps, class system, and a strong emphasis on teamwork within squads.
If you've been running with squads, you might have noticed yourself earning something called Squad Points as you play. These points are shared among your entire squad, and building them up is a great way to turn the tides of battle. That is, if you know how to use them. Here's everything you need to know about Squad Points in BattleBit Remastered.
How Squad Points work Gaming Even if you're an expert Call of Duty: Warzone player, your performance during any given match can be determined by your landing spot. Get unlucky with your drop spot and your team might wipe right off the bat. Likewise, a less experienced player might do well if they land away from the action.
But with so many potential landing spots, it's not always easy to pick a drop point, especially if you're unfamiliar with the game. Thankfully, we've got you covered with everything you'll need to know.
Gaming Now that Call of Duty: Warzone 2.0 Season 4 has been out for a little while, we've got a better sense of the game's weapon meta. There are some clear winners that carry over from Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II, but there are other top-tier weapons that might surprise you in battle royale. Of course, the weapon meta constantly shifts as Activision updates the way firearms perform, so we'll make sure to keep this up to date with each new patch.
These are the best Warzone 2.0 weapons for Season 4, categorized by weapon type. Keep in mind, some categories will be skipped, as they don't have any viable -- let alone meta -- options at the moment.
