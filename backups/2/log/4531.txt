Why trust us? How QuickBooks Online can help your business do 2023 right By Lucas Coll Close Image used with permission by copyright holder This content was produced in partnership with Intuit.
Most people’s New Year’s resolutions are focused on things like fitness and kicking bad habits but if you’re a small business owner or are looking to start a new business in the coming months, then your resolutions are more likely to include your entrepreneurial goals for 2023. One of the most important and challenging aspects of running any business, large or small, is bookkeeping, and QuickBooks Online is the surest way to keep your books in order and start your business off right for the new year ahead. Right now, you can enjoy 50% off your first three months when you sign up for or.
Whether you’re a new entrepreneur who’s fresh to the game or you have some experience managing a business, you’re likely already aware that starting and running a company is no easy task. At the core of running a business is managing its finances. The goal of a business is to generate a profit, after all, and that means keeping tabs on every cent coming in and going out. QuickBooks Online streamlines the process by automating much of your bookkeeping for you.
How QuickBooks works for you, and your business You can sync QuickBooks Online with all of your financial accounts (banking, credit, payment processors, etc.), and QuickBooks will automatically track all of your outgoing expenses and incoming payments for you. You can easily see all activity anytime, anywhere — including on mobile devices thanks to the QuickBooks app — and get up-to-date readouts on products that are in stock and on order if your business is one that handles shipping and inventory. This bird’s eye view of your business’ finances helps you to make smarter decisions based on real-time data. QuickBooks Online also makes it easy to set up recurring payments and invoices so you can make sure you’re paying bills and getting paid on time.
QuickBooks Payroll is the companion to QuickBooks Online. Whereas QuickBooks Online streamlines your bookkeeping, the Payroll add-on does the same for your payroll, allowing you to manage, schedule, and automate outgoing payments to your team. QuickBooks Payroll also automatically fills out expense reports and filed tax forms for you, automating your bookkeeping process even further. This makes sure that your crew gets paid faster and you spend less time managing your books. Should you ever need some professional help, QuickBooks Live puts you in touch with an expert who can give you a hand.
QuickBooks is an easy and economical way to start 2023 off right for your business, and for the new year, you can enjoy a 50% discount on your first three months of QuickBooks Online and/or QuickBooks Payroll when you sign up now. The discount is available for both platforms, and you can also try them risk-free for a full 30 days without paying anything.
Editors' Recommendations QuickBooks Free Trial: Get a month of accounting for free This Tool Can Seriously Help You Grow Your Small Business No W-2s? 2023 is the year of QuickBooks Online ONLYOFFICE is the online software suite your business needs Beat the rush and save $100 on QuickBooks tax software today Business Business Deals These days, there's a lot of talk about what you should and shouldn't do as a business to woo new customers and keep existing ones happy. Just read any one of the many marketing-friendly guides out there and you'll see a host of tips about improving your customer service, adding new features, beefing up product quality, and so on. Indeed, these are all good changes to make, and they lead to a more successful business overall, but they have one thing in common, and that's why they make such a difference. They are customer-centric. They put the customer's needs and experience first while improving the general experience for everyone else.
Customer-centric companies are 60% more profitable than those that aren't. But that's such a broad term, and it could reference so many different facets of a business from customer service to product delivery and personalization. Where is the best place to start, and what should be a core focus? It all boils down to creating and delivering, a seamless, connected experience for employees and customers alike. In other words, "customer-centric" can be achieved today by deploying an integrated unified communications as a service (UCaaS) and contact center as a service (CCaaS) solution like RingCentral. Wait, what? Slow down.
Why do unified communications matter? Deals Personalization is the key to winning customers in today’s hyper-virtual and almost exclusively digital world. From social media to websites, customers prefer messaging, and they like it, even more, when that messaging is tailored to them. In fact, research shows that 80% of consumers are more likely to purchase when the experience they have — or are having — is personalized. It can be attributed to how much time consumers spend on digital and social channels, browsing from their phones and in a more intimate setting. They expect buying experiences to be relevant, instant, effortless, and empathetic to their needs.
One of the best ways to deliver these kinds of experiences is through natural messaging channels, be it on social networks, or display ad networks. However, businesses cannot just deploy an army of representatives to cover those channels and deliver communications on-demand, 24/7. Representatives can’t offer the type of interactive, media-rich experiences that automation can. Automation, or more specifically chatbots, is really the only solution then. Inherently, however, chatbots are difficult to get right. You want a more conversational tone and a system that engages with the consumer and presents a more human-like character. You want interactive conversational commerce or lead generation experiences that guide your customers to take action. Spectrm not only has such a solution available, it offers highly optimized conversational intelligence tools that also make every datapoint actionable. What does that mean? Instead of merely engaging with consumers, Spectrm enables you to identify their preferences, understand their intent, recommend products in real-time, segment and retarget them with push notifications, and even optimize your funnel based on data you collect in chat.
Business So you’ve decided to become an entrepreneur. Whether you’ve recently quit your job or have chosen to turn your side hustle into a full-time business, it’s an exciting time. Starting an online business can also be very challenging, especially if you’ve never done so before. Making the right choices now can greatly impact your success down the line, and the last thing you want to do is spend your energy revisiting old decisions instead of growing your company. A strong foundation is the key to a successful and thriving small business.
To help you take the first steps, we’ve teamed up with BigCommerce, a feature-rich ecommerce solution for small businesses. Their retailers grow at 28 percent year after year on average, which makes them the ideal partner to help us offer advice on how to start, build, and improve your business.
1. Determine your unique selling proposition Building a business around something you’re passionate about is one thing. It’s important that your product or service has something unique about it, too, to differentiate it from your competitors. Think about price, quality, ease of use, and the status associated with it -- any of these aspects could be emphasized to help you stand out from the crowd.
