Some of its highlights include a six-speaker sound system, a 2.7-pound lightweight design, an 8-core CPU, 10-core GPU, two USB-C/Thunderbolt ports, and an 18-hour battery life.
Review: I can't recommend the 15-inch MacBook Air enough, even if it's not for me The laptop's advanced capabilities even earned it a spot as ZDNET's top pick for best laptops in 2023. Finding a discount on an Apple device is typically difficult; therefore, a discount this big is something you should hop on.
View now at Best Buy Sony - WH1000XM5 Wireless Noise-Canceling Over-the-Ear Headphones Save $70 Matthew Miller/ZDNET If you are shopping for an audiophile and want ZDNET's pick for the best over-ear headphones on the market, you are in luck because the Sony WH-1000XM5 is on sale.
Once you gift someone these headphones, they'll never go back to listening to music without them. The Sony WH1000XM5s offer incredible audio, immersive active noise-cancellation, long battery life, and premiere comfort, placing them ahead of market competitors.
Compared to its already impressive predecessor, the WH-1000XM5 has a better form factor with an improved folding design, and more comfortable ear pads, allowing for long-wear listening sessions in comfort.
My boyfriend is an audio aficionado who listens to music at all times of the day, and as a result, he got these headphones last holiday season and has been absolutely obsessed since. The price point is pretty steep, and that's why a $70 discount offers a much-needed relief to your wallet.
Full review: Sony's WH-1000XM5 headphones are basically perfect View now at Best Buy Amazon - Echo Show 8 (2nd Gen, 2021 release) Save $75 David Gewirtz Current price: $55 Original price: $130 Amazon recently dropped its latest Echo Show 8 (2023, 3rd Generation), and although it has significant upgrades from prior models, it has a hefty $150 price tag. If you own an Echo Dot, enjoy Alexa's assistance, and want to save some money, an Echo Show 8 (2021, 2nd Generation) would make a great addition to your household.
This Echo device has an 8-inch HD touchscreen and a 13MP camera that allows you to do tasks you wouldn't be able to with the speaker, such as making video calls and having it display photos, recipes, news, streaming, and more. You can even use it to display the video feed from your Blink Security Cameras.
As ZDNET's smart home expert Maria Diaz says , "The newest Echo Show 8 makes a compelling case for a smart display for both Alexa fans and smart home enthusiasts, but the $150 price tag, higher than previous generations, could be a deterrent. The second-generation Echo Show 8 retails for $130, though it's often discounted, like right now, at only $70." Review: Echo Show 8 View now at Best Buy Apple - AirPods Max Save $100 Jason Hiner/ZDNET Current price: $450 Original price: $550 If you know someone who is an Apple user, loves listening to music, and is always on the go or needs to prioritize comfort, this gift is sure to impress. Because the AirPods Max are over-the-ear headphones, unlike the AirPods Pro, you can completely avoid them falling out of your ear, and the lightweight feel guarantees comfort for hours.
To expand comfort even further, the headphones have a mesh canopy that doesn't apply much any pressure to the top of the user's head, and the memory foam cushions on each ear to ensure comfort.
In addition, to having a sleek look with fun colors to pick from, these headphones also offer instant connectivity, multi-device switching, Transparency Mode, Spatial Audio, and overall exceptional sound.
These headphones even made ZDNET's pick for best headphones for Apple users because of how well they fit into the Apple ecosystem. The AirPods Max have a hefty price tag, so a $100 discount is huge.
Review: AirPods Max review: Stunning sound and performance mean I'm keeping the $550 headphones View now at Best Buy Sony - 55" Class BRAVIA XR A95K OLED Save $1,100 Best Buy/ZDNET Current price: $1,700 Original price: $2,800 The Sony A95K is a strong competitor in the OLED TV space, even earning it a spot as ZDNET's best OLED TV overall for 2023.
 This TV would make an excellent gift for someone who really cares about the picture quality of what they are watching, boasting upscaled 4K resolution, a wide range of colors, XR OLED Contrast Pro, and Dolby Vision support.
This TV could also be a great purchase if you're someone who has been putting off upgrading your TV until you found the perfect deal or a compelling reason to upgrade. The biggest con of this TV is its price tag, which is steep due to all of its exceptional visual and sound features. But you can buy it for $300 off right now.

We also looked over customer reviews to find out what matters to real people who already own and use the deals we're recommending. Our recommendations may also be based on our own testing -- in addition to extensive research and comparison shopping. The goal is to deliver the most accurate advice to help you shop smarter.
