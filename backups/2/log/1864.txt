Over the two days, there will be 154 posters presented in total.
​ The poster session is an informal event where attendees can walk between all posters and exhibitions. It is useful to think about how you can explain the content of your poster very briefly, so that even those who aren’t working in your topic will be able to understand your motivations and learn about a different area.
Poster allocations Every poster will be presented on either Monday or Tuesday. Find your allocation below.

Poster printing: We suggest you print your poster in advance and bring it with you.
​ If you need inspiration in designing a poster, try looking here or here for some advice.
Prizes! We want everyone to have fun at these events, but also to encourage people to do their best work. The best posters will receive prizes for their efforts. We have these prizes, and a few other secret prizes to be awarded on the final night to those posters and presenters that have shined.
