The Alphabet-owned company announced move on Monday in a message on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter. It means that more riders can now take trips in Waymo’s driverless vehicles within a 47-square-mile area of the city.
SF, you asked, and we listened. Beginning today, riders can use Waymo One across our expanded service area—covering nearly 47 square miles of the city. We can’t wait to see all the places you choose to ride with Waymo One! pic.twitter.com/EzpzvhVHnx &mdash; Waymo (@Waymo) October 9, 2023 Tens of thousands of Waymo riders already had access to the majority of the city, and among those, several thousand had access to the full city. This latest announcement means that all of Waymo’s riders now have access to the full city.
The move by Waymo comes amid protests by some in the city who are worried that the technology powering the autonomous vehicles isn’t yet ready for use on public streets.
Cruise’s robotaxi service suspended by California regulator Cruise says it’s nearing approval for mass production of futuristic robotaxi An autonomous car in San Francisco got stuck in wet concrete Concerns have been raised following a number of high-profile incidents involving self-driving vehicles operated by rival autonomous car firm Cruise, which is owned by General Motors.
As recently as last week, a Cruise vehicle ran over a pedestrian right after she was hit by another vehicle, sending her into the path of the autonomous car.
 The Cruise car braked hard but came to a halt with one of its wheels on the pedestrian’s leg, pinning her to the ground.
In a further challenge to Cruise’s operations in the city, the company was ordered by regulators to halve its robotaxi fleet to 50 vehicles following a crash with a fire truck in which the autonomous car’s passenger was left with minor injuries.
Just a few days before that incident, California’s Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), which oversees commercial passenger services in the state, made a major decision when it cleared the way for Cruise and Waymo to expand their paid ridesharing services in San Francisco to all hours of the day instead of just quieter periods.
The recent events show that there is still much back and forth between those city officials who are keen to clear the way for autonomous vehicle innovation and those intent on taking a more cautious approach to the technology.
While few would argue that the autonomous systems that power driverless cars have improved significantly in the last few years, recent events have shown that urban roads are complex arenas where a myriad of unexpected situations occur and which test self-driving cars’ capabilities to the limit.
[Updated on October 11 to clarify the nature of Waymo’s expansion.] Editors' Recommendations Cruise woes prompt production halt of fully driverless van Cruise autonomous vehicle drives over woman just after she was hit by another car Robotaxi firm Cruise ordered to halve fleet following incidents Waymo taps the brakes on its autonomous-trucking project Waymo’s robotaxis are coming to Uber’s ridesharing app Tech for Change Tech News The Food Fight Cars Waymo is expanding the service area for its robotaxi service in Phoenix, Arizona, and San Francisco, California, paving the way for longer trips across more communities.
In a blog post on Thursday, May 4, Alphabet-owned Waymo said it’s doubling its service area in Phoenix and as a result now serves 180 square miles of The Valley, an expansion that it claims makes it “the largest fully autonomous service area in the world.” Cars Driving in thick fog is a big enough challenge for humans, but it turns out self-driving cars find it pretty tricky, too.
Overwhelmed by dense fog in San Francisco early on Tuesday morning, five of Waymo’s fully driverless vehicles suddenly parked by the side of a residential street in what appeared to be a precautionary measure, the San Francisco Chronicle reported. Another of its cars apparently came to halt in the middle of the street, the news outlet said.
Cars An issue with self-driving cars that apparently no one previously considered has come to light: dozing passengers.
Officials in San Francisco, where Alphabet’s Waymo company and GM-backed Cruise are currently operating robotaxi services as part of ongoing trials, highlighted the problem in a recent letter to the regulator, Wired reported.
