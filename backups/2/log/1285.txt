Black Friday is on Nov. 24 this year, and many of your favorite retailers, like Amazon, Best Buy, Target, and Walmart are slicing their prices on products during the day of deals. While Black Friday technically takes place on Nov. 24, many big retailers run deals throughout the month. Amazon's deals start early, on November 17, for example.
How did we choose these early Black Friday deals? ZDNET only writes about deals we want to buy -- devices and products we desire, need, or would recommend. Our experts looked for deals that were at least 20% off (or are hardly ever on sale), using established price comparison tools and trackers to determine whether the deal is actually on sale and how frequently it drops.
We also looked over customer reviews to find out what matters to real people who already own and use the deals we're recommending. Our recommendations may also be based on our own testing -- in addition to extensive research and comparison shopping. The goal is to deliver the most accurate advice to help you shop smarter.
What is the best early Black Friday deal under $100? This whole list of deals is great, but if we had to choose one under-$100 product you should definitely grab ahead of Black Friday, it would be the Apple AirPods for $100 right now.
