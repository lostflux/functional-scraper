If you want to celebrate the season by watching movies, new and classic TV shows, and buzzworthy content you can’t find on any other streamer, Hulu is the destination for you in December.
From intriguing new original series like Culprits to returning shows like Letterkenny (for its 12th and final season), as well as movies like Maggie Moore(s) with John Hamm and Tina Fey, The Matrix movies , and the cult classic Paddington 2 (with a singing and dancing Hugh Grant, long before Wonka ), Hulu subscribers will find something suitable for everyone in the household.
The complete list of Hulu’s new arrivals in December 2023 is below.

However, Netflix has its own streaming events to make big announcements for next year's biggest shows. And they don't get much bigger than the live-action Avatar: The Last Airbender series. The adaptation of the beloved Nickelodeon animated series finally has a premiere date: February 22, 2024. Netflix also dropped the first trailer, which will look very familiar to fans of the original show.
Avatar: The Last Airbender | Official Teaser | Netflix Entertainment If you're coming to Hulu for your action fix, then you've come to the right place. Hulu may be owned and operated by Disney, but this streaming service is about as far from the Mickey Mouse Club as you can get. Hulu has all of the R-rated action flicks that just wouldn't fit in at Disney+, Deadpool movies and Logan notwithstanding.
This month, two of our action picks are based on comic books, while the third is an all-timer in the action genre that won't be hanging around on Hulu for much longer. These are the three action movies on Hulu that you need to watch in November.
Blade II (2001) Entertainment Much like romance itself, finding rom-coms on Hulu is a lot harder than it should be. Disney's mature streamer is pretty good about telling us what's new on Hulu, but less so when it comes to rom-coms in specific. Romantic drama films get their own category in Hulu's search engine, but rom-coms do not.
Fortunately, it's not impossible to find a good romantic comedy or three on Hulu. This month, our picks include Adam Sandler's best rom-com, a modern take on a conventional office romance, and an independent film with a cast to die for. These are the three rom-coms on Hulu that you need to watch in November.
