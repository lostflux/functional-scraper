Why trust us? FuboTV: channels, price, plans, packages, and add-ons By Phil Nickinson and Amanda Blain Close If you’re a sports fan, FuboTV may be the answer to your cord-cutting dreams. What is FuboTV? It’s a live streaming service that focuses mainly on sports-focused live TV and can help you quit cable for good. And it’s very much growing in popularity, currently sitting in fourth place in the U.S. with about 1.17 million subscribers.
FuboTV price and plans FuboTV channels FuboTV and 4K FuboTV devices FuboTV ’s pricing and plans — and even the channels available — are competitive with services that are many times its size. And that’s what’s great about the whole streaming space: You have options. That’s also the hard part. It can be tough to tell the difference between FuboTV and Hulu With Live TV.
 Or FuboTV versus YouTube TV.
 What makes one stand out above the others? We’ll look at the FuboTV channels, pricing, and everything else that makes it what it is, including what makes it a viable option in 2023.
Phil Nickinson/Digital Trends FuboTV price and plans There are four Fubo TV plans — Fubo Pro, Fubo Elite, Fubo Ultimate, and Fubo Latino — that range in price from $70 per month to $100 per month.
What is DirecTV Stream: plans, pricing, channels, and more Fubo tweaks its plans again, and actually lowers price of one tier Google TV gives NFL Sunday Ticket top billing, adds FAST channels Here’s how the total FuboTV cost shakes out: Fubo Pro is the new base plan and gets you 170 channels for $75 a month. With that, you’ll have 1,000 hours of cloud-based DVR (the ability to “record” shows to play back later) and the ability to watch on up to 10 screens at home and two away from your home network. This is what Fubo calls “unlimited” despite it having a pretty clear limit.
Fubo Elite ramps things up to $85 a month and has 235 channels (with 130-plus events in 4K ), another 54 from the Fubo Extra plan, and another 11 from News Plus. DVR remains the same at 1,000 hours, and you still have the same 10 “unlimited” screens at home and two on the road.
Fubo Premier is $95 a month and offers 244 channels in all (with the usual events in 4K), plus the same extra channels as Elite — 54 Fubo Extra and 11 News Plus channels. It also includes Showtime, has 1,000 hours of cloud-based DVR, and 10 unlimited screens, plus two away from home.
Fubo Latino is $33 a month and offers 45 channels of Latino-themed content and a cloud DVR of 250 hours. You can only watch two screens at once on this plan.
All of these plans come with a free seven-day trial. You can pay monthly or quarterly — but there’s no discount if you fork over the cash for three months at a time.
FuboTV channels FuboTV has a competitive slate of channels. That starts with your local broadcast affiliates, though you’ll want to check the Fubo website because those can vary slightly depending on where you live.
Fubo Pro — the new starter plan — has 145 channels, but that number includes eight different beIN Sports channels, 11 from TUDN, and a few others that also have alternates.

Phil Nickinson/Digital Trends Other FuboTV add-ons The channels above are just the base plans. There are a number of other options as well.
You’ll find a few premium movie options, which include multiple channels. Those include: Showtime for $11 a month Starz for $9 a month Epix for $6 a month Pantaya for $6 a month Or you can get Showtime, Starz and Epix bundled together for $20 a month, saving you $6 a month.
There are a number of additional sports and news packages, too. Some of it is in addition to what you’d get with Fubo Pro or Fubo Elite, but there also is some overlap. Here’s how it all breaks down: Sports Plus with NFL RedZone ($11 a month): This gets you NFL RedZone, which flips through the games as teams are about to score.

FuboTV and 4K FuboTV, at one point, was the only live TV streaming service in the U.S. to offer up anything in 4K. (Yes, upscaled 4K , not native.) That was and remains limited to live sports, and it’s still better than nothing. But events remain fairly few and far between, with maybe a game or race a day. (Here’s the full FuboTV 4K schedule.
) And FuboTV isn’t the only 4K game in town anymore — YouTube TV also offers up pretty much the same events from the likes of NBC Sports and Fox. One major change in 2022, however, is that FuboTV no longer throws in 4K content for free anymore on the Pro plan.
Like with YouTube TV, you’ll have to pay up if you want any sort of show in 4K resolution. That means you’ll have to eschew the $70-a-month Pro plan and skip straight to the $80-a-month Elite package. That’s still $5 cheaper than the $85 a month you’ll have to pay for 4K content on YouTube TV ($65 for the base plan and $20 for the 4K Plus package), so there’s that.
And the usual caveats still apply. You’ll need to have a TV with a 4K panel, and any other device you’re using to actually stream Fubo TV will need to support 4K resolution.
Phil Nickinson/Digital Trends FuboTV devices The short version is this: If you have a relatively new device — be it a streaming stick, connected TV, or even a web browser — you should be able to get to FuboTV. The app is available on every major streaming platform.
Here’s the more detailed breakdown: Amazon Fire TV: This goes for all Fire TV devices, as well as the awkwardly named Fire TV Edition TVs (basically, that’s a TV with Fire TV OS as the operating system.) Android TV/Google TV: This means devices like Nvidia Shield and Chromecast with Google TV, as well as other devices that are running full builds of Android TV. The same goes for televisions with Android TV as the operating system.
Apple TV: From the fourth-generation box and newer.
Android phones/tablets: So long as you have Android 5.0 or higher — and you almost certainly do.
Roku: It’s the biggest streaming device in the U.S. and fully supported for Model 3700X and up.
Xbox: If you have Xbox One, One S, or One X, you’re good to go.
Smart TVs: You can watch FuboTV on Vizio from 2016, Samsung from 2015, LG from 2018, and Hisense from 2020.
iOS/iPad OS: From iOS 13 and up and iPad OS 13.1 and up.
Web browsers: You’re good on Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Firefox, and Safari.
Editors' Recommendations YouTube TV still leads after latest round of streaming numbers Sling TV adds live scores and more for sports fans YouTube TV in 4K: Everything you need to know Disney+, Hulu, ESPN+ get new pricing schemes this fall YouTube TV adds Magnolia Network and other FAST channels Entertainment Virtual Reality Audio / Video Hulu With Live TV is one of the largest live TV streaming services (also known as a Multichannel Video Programming Distributor, or MVPD) in the United States. If you want to watch live, linear television, is an excellent option.
Audio / Video When you think of streaming video, you think YouTube. And so YouTube TV — Google's live TV streaming service — very much just makes sense for a lot of people. Designed for those who want to cut the cord and ditch their cable or satellite subscriptions (and known in the industry as a multichannel video programming distributor, or MPVD), YouTube TV competes in the same arena as other streaming television services like DirecTV Stream (formerly known as AT&T TV Now and DirecTV Now), Sling TV, FuboTV, and Hulu With Live TV.
And YouTube TV offers a unique mix of features that make it very appealing, so much so that it's now the No. 1 service in the U.S. in terms of the number of paid subscribers, with some 5 million subscribers as of June 2022 — up some 2 million from the last time the service gave an update in October 2020. The popularity is due to several factors. YouTube TV is easy to use. It's got a selection of channels that's competitive with all its rivals. And the YouTube TV price is competitive, too. You're able to watch YouTube TV on pretty much any modern device. And the fact that parent company Alphabet (aka Google) has been marketing the heck out of it the past few years certainly hasn't hurt, either.
Audio / Video When it comes to streaming options in the U.S., Sling TV plans and prices continue to keep it among the best live TV streaming services available — at least in terms of price. That's largely because it's as close as you can get to true a la carte TV, which theoretically lets you pick and choose your channels. Sling TV isn't quite that -- it's more of a skinny bundle situation. But it's still an extremely good value.
There are, however, some fairly serious caveats. That's in part because of the way Sling packages its channels. But also because there's a strong probability that you won't be able to get all of your local broadcast channels. That's something you need to know upfront.
