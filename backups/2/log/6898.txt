Home Audio / Video News YouTube TV is still growing on the back of NFL Sunday Ticket By Phil Nickinson Close Not being able to pick your own games means YouTube TV’s multiview could get you two NFL games (one twice) … and bowling.
Phil Nickinson / Digital Trends One of our favorite (and more annoying) games to play is “Which streaming service is the biggest?” And for the most part, we tend to have pretty strong answers.
YouTube TV is the biggest , probably. It’s followed by Hulu With Live TV, then Sling TV, and then FuboTV. And DirecTV Stream is way at the back of the pack. Again, probably.
The hedging is because three of those providers give solid numbers every three months. One of them gives numbers whenever its corporate overlords feel like making a splash. And one doesn’t say anything at all.
But we did get a very brief glimpse behind the YouTube TV curtain in Google’s (ahem, Alphabet’s) third-quarter earnings call. For some context, the last time we got any actual subscriber numbers for YouTube TV was in June 2022 , when it said “we’re humbled that 5 million of you are currently on this journey with us.” That was 2 million more than the previous time it said anything about numbers, which was in October 2020.
YouTube TV still leads after latest round of streaming numbers NFL buffering on YouTube TV? You’re not alone today YouTube rolling out some three-dozen new features this fall Google has never been more specific than that, though. And it still wasn’t today. We’ve long worried that maybe YouTube TV has actually been shrinking in the interim, and we’d never know it. But it looks like that’s not the case.
The first season of NFL Sunday Ticket on YouTube TV doesn’t allow you to pick what games you watch in multiview.
Phil Nickinson / Digital Trends Ruth Porat, who serves as president and chief investment officer for Google, in addition to being the CFO, noted that the “other revenues” category was up 21% to $8.3 billion. She attributed “YouTube non-advertising revenue driven by subscriber growth in YouTube TV, followed by YouTube Music Premium.” So, YouTube TV is still growing. But by how much? We don’t know.
Philipp Schindler, Google’s chief business officer, gave a little more color on the state of YouTube TV during the earnings call Q&A in response to a question from Michael Nathanson, senior managing director at MoffettNathanson.
“I think in the broader context,” Schindler said, “you have to look at ( NFL Sunday Ticket ) as our overall YouTube subscription strategy. The great feedback we’ve gotten so far on the YouTube experience is very, very significant. People love the navigation. They love multiview. They love the chats and the polls and, frankly, people are very happy with the lack of latency here.” Schindler also reiterated one of the bigger requests the company has heard from customers — the ability to choose which games you can watch in multiview , instead of just going with a few set options. There’s still no word on whether that’ll come to YouTube TV anytime soon. ESPN+ and Apple TV have their own multiview options that allow for it. On the other hand, YouTube TV also allows you to watch news channels in multiview.
 For its part, Google has said that allowing viewers to pick their own games is “a very hard thing to do technically.” “Overall, the teams are working hard to build a fantastic experience,” Schindler said. “And we are really trying to stay focused on getting our first season right and providing the best possible experience.” So, again, we wait. We wait for actual subscriber numbers, and an improved multiview. No bets on which will come first.
Editors' Recommendations YouTube’s enhanced 1080p video now available on more devices YouTube NFL outage: Should Google give refunds or credits? Everyone is missing the point on streaming video Multiview almost fixes one of the biggest problems with YouTube TV NFL Sunday Ticket in 2023: Everything you need to know Cord Cutting 101 Streaming Services Tech News YouTube Audio / Video When it comes to streaming live TV in the U.S. (or streaming any kind of video anywhere, for that matter), resolution and bit rate remain as important as ever. And you're now able to enjoy YouTube TV in 4K. Some of it, at least. And if it seems like it's taken forever for that to happen, you're not wrong.
The basic fact is that it takes a lot of bandwidth to stream video — and that's even more difficult when you're talking linear TV, (and more so still if it's a live event like sports). So it's not really that much of a surprise to learn that most live channels stream at 720p resolution — or maybe 1080p if you're lucky. (We'll leave frame rate out of the equation for a minute, but it's a thing, too, especially for sports.) Audio / Video In a slightly surprising and somewhat quiet shift, YouTube and YouTube TV are offering up a free seven-day trial of NFL Sunday Ticket. That is, you can watch any and all games (barring local blackouts) on a given Sunday, and then cancel if you want. Or keep NFL Sunday Ticket and watch all the games on all the Sundays.
The details were unceremoniously dropped on a YouTube/YouTube TV support page. The free trials should be available now, but the page does note that "if you don't see the 7-day trial at checkout, try again soon." Audio / Video It's tough to hit a YouTube property lately without running into a giant banner for NFL Sunday Ticket. And for good reason — the only (legal) service that lets you watch all the Sunday NFL games has moved from DirecTV to YouTube and YouTube TV. And that means that NFL Sunday Ticket is available to a lot more people. Like, all of them.
That's a good thing. The ability to watch what you want on whatever hardware you have is important. But there's a funny little fluke when it comes to how you buy NFL Sunday Ticket. Depending on the platform you're on, you might not actually be able to purchase NFL Sunday Ticket. At least not without taking a few extra steps.
