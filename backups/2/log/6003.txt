That game is called Haunted Chocolatier , and it looks like a whole other world of fun, casual simulation where you find out the secret desires of every single member of your community.
Release date Platforms Trailers Gameplay Multiplayer and co-op Preorders Details are still limited ‚Äî ‚ÄúI just like working in secret,‚Äù ConcernedApe reported in his last official progress update ‚Äî but don‚Äôt worry, plenty of info has already dropped, and we‚Äôll keep you updated about every detail so you know what‚Äôs going on.
Release date Image used with permission by copyright holder There is no set release date for Haunted Chocolatier , and it looks like it‚Äôs going to be in development a bit longer than fans initially expected.
Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League: release date, trailers, gameplay, and more Marathon: release date speculation, trailers, gameplay, and more Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth: release date, trailers, gameplay, and more The most recent update on the game‚Äôs progress comes from an interview Barone did with Screen Rant in December 2022. The interview focused on a collaboration between Barone and the indie-pop band Alvvays to make a music video for their song ‚ÄúMany Mirrors,‚Äù but there were also a few Stardew Valley references and news about Haunted Chocolatier as well. Here‚Äôs what Barone had to say about his progress on Haunted Chocolatier: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going well, but it‚Äôs a big game. I have a big, ambitious vision for it. It‚Äôs a little bit daunting, the amount of work that it‚Äôs going to be. But Stardew Valley took me fou-and-a-half years; I‚Äôve been working on Haunted Chocolatier for about a year and a half or maybe two years now. I announced it a little bit over a year ago, but it‚Äôs still gonna be a while. But I think it‚Äôs going good. So far. There‚Äôs a lot of good things so far.‚Äù‚Äò In April 2023, Barone tweeted that he was working on an update to Stardew Valley and that he was taking a break from developing Haunted Chocolatier temporarily. It appears that the break is over though ‚Äî in October, he tweeted a few new images from the game.
Thanks for 1 million followers üëçhere&#39;s a few Haunted Chocolatier images pic.twitter.com/3PW2jMIF3R &mdash; ConcernedApe (@ConcernedApe) October 4, 2023 If Haunted Chocolatier takes as long to get to its final form as Stardew Valley did, fans might not see the game until 2025 at the earliest.
Platforms ConcernedApe Haunted Chocolatier will absolutely be coming out on PC, but there has been no mention of other platforms.
Stardew Valley eventually made its way to consoles and mobile, so we‚Äôre assuming Haunted Chocolatier will be readily available to all gamers as well.
Trailers We‚Äôve only seen a quick glimpse of Haunted Chocolatier in an early gameplay video released in October 2021. The video shows citizens going about their day in a cozy little town, a little bit of combat as a character gathers ingredients in the wild, and some chocolate-making footage from inside the chocolate factory.
Gameplay Image used with permission by copyright holder Haunted Chocolatier begins with the player starting up a chocolate shop while living in a haunted castle in the middle of a snowy community. The player will need to seek a wide variety of ingredients and alliances to make the best chocolate possible and ultimately reach success.
It‚Äôs not surprising just how similar the game looks to Stardew Valley so far. ConcernedApe has compared it to the energy of the moon, as Stardew Valley was the energy of the sun. The art style, movement, and interface are all recognizable here. However, it is being created in a new engine, which appears to allow for some important additions. So far, there‚Äôs no information if it‚Äôs actually placed in the same world as Stardew Valley.
The simulation aspects One of the things people fell in love with in Stardew Valley was the ability to take their time, get to know everyone in the community, and make progress with a variety of relationships (and farming, of course), what Barone calls a ‚Äútown game.‚Äù Haunted Chocolatier will be more of the same, with similar systems to give gifts, get to know characters, and progress relationships‚Ä¶or make mistakes.
Action and combat Here‚Äôs where Haunted Chocolatier splits from Stardew Valley in important ways. There is a much greater emphasis on Action RPG features, and that includes combat, which has a complete overhaul. There will be a variety of weapons and shields, a full blocking system, a stun system connected with successfully blocking enemies, and more. This should make foraging attempts and exploration an interesting part of the game for those who want a little more action in their chocolate-making plans.
Surprisingly, the combat in the game could take a bit of inspiration from Diablo II.
‚ÄúWhen I was in the early stages of Haunted Chocolatier, I was playing a bunch of Diablo II. Getting loot and seeing your numbers go up on the stats? I like that stuff,‚Äù said Barone in a December 2022 interview with Screen Rant.
 ‚ÄúI feel like a lot of Stardew Valley players aren‚Äôt that into it, but I‚Äôve just got to do what I think is fun. And I think that‚Äôll shine through in the game, if I‚Äôm excited about it.‚Äù The soundtrack Fans of Stardew Valley are no doubt eager to know what sort of soothing tunes Haunted Chocolatier will have. Good news ‚Äî it sounds great so far. You can check out the trailer to get an idea of what to expect. We probably won‚Äôt hear much more until the game nears completion.
Multiplayer and co-op Image used with permission by copyright holder According to the FAQ section of the developer‚Äôs blog, Haunted Chocolatier is being designed as a single-player game with no plans for any kind of multiplayer aspects.
Preorders The game is still likely a couple of years from release, so there‚Äôs no chance to pre-order it just yet. We‚Äôll keep you posted.
Editors' Recommendations Hollow Knight: Silksong: release date speculation, trailers, gameplay, and more GTA 6: release date speculation, trailer, news, rumors, and more RoboCop: Rogue City: release date speculation, trailers, gameplay, and more The Elder Scrolls 6: release date speculation, rumors, news, and more Super Mario RPG: release date, trailers, gameplay, and more Tech News Gaming Horror games have an interesting lineage. Most gamers' first real exposure to what we consider the template for "modern" horror was the original Resident Evil or, perhaps, Silent Hill. However, even those games had clear influences. One was a somewhat obscure Japanese game called Sweet Home, but in terms of 3D horror, Alone in the Dark was an experience like nothing else. Based on the unique cosmic horror writing of H.P. Lovecraft, this series, unfortunately, saw a fast fall from grace with the arrival of its sequels.
Despite a few leaks, most were still caught off guard by the announcement that Alone in the Dark would not only be coming back, but the new game would apparently be a reboot of the series that aims to take it back to its survival-horror roots. There are nearly as many mysteries surrounding the revival of this historic IP as there are in its narrative, but we've braved the dark corners of the internet to bring you everything we know about Alone in the Dark.
Release date Gaming As Frank Herbert famously wrote, fear is the mind-killer, but after decades of waiting, gamers can finally put their fears aside as there's a new Dune game on the horizon. There was a litany of reveals and announcements at the 2021 Game Awards, but perhaps the least expected was Dune: Spice Wars from developer Shiro Games. While excitement is surging again for this franchise thanks to the new films adapting Herbert's world-renowned sci-fi novels, no one was expecting a tie-in game to be announced, let alone one following in the footsteps of the classic Dune II: The Building of a Dynasty from way back in 1992.
While the origins of most genres are muddled at best, it is almost undisputed that Dune 2: The Building of a Dynasty was the first true real-time strategy game. That makes it all the more appropriate for Dune: Spice Wars to return to the genre, and Shiro Games, developers of Northgard, seems like a great fit to bring this series back. This game is closer than you might expect, and while spice is the key to controlling the universe, information is a close second. Here's everything we know about Dune: Spice Wars.
Release date window Gaming Rumors have been floating around about a new Tekken for some time, but we've gotten firm confirmation that Tekken 8 is on the way, and it looks amazing. While the initial details revealed at Sony‚Äôs State of Play were sparse, we've got plenty of new looks and impressions of the latest 3D fighter. Here‚Äôs everything we can glean from this exciting reveal -‚Äì and what Tekken 8 looks like it has in store for its characters.
Release date Tekken 8 will enter the ring on January 26 2024.
Platforms Expect Tekken 8 to arrive on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. It won‚Äôt be supported on last-gen systems, which makes sense with all that detailed work in Unreal Engine 5. That‚Äôs also why it won‚Äôt be coming to any mobile devices any time soon, although you could give it a shot on the Steam Deck if you don‚Äôt mind lowering performance.
