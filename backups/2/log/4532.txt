Why trust us? This Tool Can Seriously Help You Grow Your Small Business By Briley Kenney Close Image used with permission by copyright holder This content was produced in partnership with Intuit.
Efficient Accounting and Financial Management Automated Payroll Processing Improved Cash Flow Management Better Time Management Whether you’re starting a business, or you have a well-established venture up and running already, you’ll need a bit of support to play in the big leagues. Large organizations have a lot more resources at their disposal, including an inordinate amount of funds to work with for marketing, tools, software, and much more. While you may never be up to their speed, you do have a lot of options, if you know where to look. Intuit’s QuickBooks Online and QuickBooks Payroll, for example, are powerful tools that can help small businesses grow and thrive. These software solutions provide a wide range of benefits for business owners, from streamlining accounting and financial management to automating payroll and tax reporting. Below, we’ll explore some of the ways that QuickBooks Online and QuickBooks Payroll can seriously help your small business grow.
Efficient Accounting and Financial Management One of the most significant benefits of using QuickBooks Online is that it makes accounting and financial management simple, efficient, and relatively automated. QuickBooks Online allows you to manage your finances from anywhere, whether you’re at the office or on the go. You can track income and expenses, create and send invoices, and even manage your bank accounts and credit cards directly from the platform. This is huge if you’re running a smaller, e-commerce business where you have invoices, expenses, and costs going out — and coming in — from a wide variety of sources. Dropshipping store, anyone? With QuickBooks Online, you can also generate financial reports with ease. These reports can provide you with valuable insights into your business’s financial health, including cash flow, profits and losses, and balance sheets. Armed with this information, you can make informed decisions about how to grow your business and manage your finances more effectively. You can also take on major challenges or hurdles, like an economic downswing or stagflation.
In addition to these features, QuickBooks Online also integrates with a wide range of other software solutions, such as payment processing systems and inventory management software. This means that you can create a comprehensive financial management system that meets all of your business’s needs, helping you stay organized and efficient as you grow. It also puts you on an even keel with the larger businesses and organizations making waves in the market.
Automated Payroll Processing Another critical area where QuickBooks can help your small business grow is payroll processing. QuickBooks Payroll is a comprehensive payroll management system that automates many of the time-consuming and error-prone aspects of payroll processing. Your employees want to get paid, and you want to make sure they get paid, promptly, and accurately.
With QuickBooks Payroll, you can easily manage employee hours, calculate payroll taxes, and generate paychecks. The software also handles tax filings and payments automatically, helping you stay compliant with tax laws and regulations. This can save you a significant amount of time and effort, allowing you to focus on other areas of your business that truly matter, like perhaps procuring some new goods to sell or optimizing a new service to provide your customers.
In addition to these benefits, QuickBooks Payroll also integrates with QuickBooks Online, making it easy to manage all aspects of your business’s finances from a single platform. This integration also means that you can generate comprehensive reports on payroll expenses, helping you manage labor costs and make informed decisions about hiring and staffing.
Improved Cash Flow Management Cash flow is critical for any small business, and QuickBooks Online can help you manage your cash flow more effectively. The platform provides a range of features that can help you stay on top of your revenue and income, including automated invoicing and payment reminders.
With QuickBooks Online, you can create and send invoices to customers, vendors, or partners quickly and easily. The software also sends automatic payment reminders, helping you get paid faster and improving your cash flow. In addition, QuickBooks Online can connect to your bank account, allowing you to see your financial movements in real-time to make informed decisions about spending and investments.

QuickBooks Online and QuickBooks Payroll can help you save time and streamline your operations. With these software solutions, you can automate many of the time-consuming tasks associated with accounting and payroll processing, freeing up time to focus on other areas of your business. You’ll be able to step away from your office or your desk more frequently, and with greater confidence knowing that everything is being sorted and handled appropriately.
In addition, QuickBooks Online and QuickBooks Payroll provide comprehensive reporting features that can help you stay on top of your business’s performance. Because it automates many of these processes and provides easy-to-use reporting tools, QuickBooks can help you stay organized and efficient as you grow and scale. The latter is important because sometimes scaling a business calls for shifting to new platforms, software tools, and other sources that can handle larger and more frequent tasks, but QuickBooks is inherently designed to grow with your business.
When all is said and done, Intuit’s QuickBooks Online and QuickBooks Payroll are powerful tools that can help small businesses like yours grow and thrive. These software solutions provide a range of benefits, from efficient accounting and financial management to automated payroll processing and improved cash flow management. By using these tools, small business owners can save time, focus on the most important aspects of their business and operation, and scale, without worrying that it’s going to break the solutions they put in place. QuickBooks will scale and grow alongside your business, and it’s an excellent comprehensive solution that you can adopt virtually anytime — whether your business is just starting, or has been thriving for a long while.

From QuickBooks to WordPress, there's an account for that. For entrepreneurs and business owners, it can pose a challenge. Using the same password for everything can save you a massive memory headache, but is the equivalent of putting all of your account eggs in one password basket. Or, you can make new passwords for everything and hope they stick in your mind for when you need them. Perhaps you can even jot them down in a notebook. But, with this approach, especially when you're talking about business credentials, you're always one mishap or stolen notebook away from a crisis.
Enter: The password manager.

For the average employed person, tax season is a relative breeze. Pop in some W-2 information and watch the refunds accumulate. At least that's what it seems like from the outside, for the increasing number of us who make money via freelancing, side hustles, and small businesses. For us, tax season can be a real headache and the endless forms for dozens of income streams can feel like a minefield.
What's worse is that guidance has never been so terrible. Established businesses have tax-prep procedures built up over the years and the resources to hire teams to get the nasty bits done, while millennials – and our younger, Gen Z friends – feel left in the dust. Doing a little Google Sheets data entry and praying that PayPal won't make any mistakes with their new reporting requirement is rough enough. Trying to put this information into unfeeling, computerized boxes that don't always match 1-to-1 with what you are wanting is enough to warrant full-on panic.
