As part of the normal churn of movies coming in and out on a monthly basis, Hulu’s fantasy lineup is largely depleted of some very familiar classics. To be frank, it’s a pretty weak fantasy library at Hulu for now. Regardless, there are still a few fantasy flicks worth checking out on Hulu. And that’s why we’ve updated our list of the best fantasy movies on Hulu right now.
Can’t get enough fantasy in your queue? Be sure to check out our roundups of the best fantasy movies on Netflix and the best fantasy movies on Amazon Prime Video.
