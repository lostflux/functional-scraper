Why trust us? The HP Envy 16 costs less, but the mighty MacBook Pro 16 retains its top spot By Mark Coppock Close Mark Coppock / Digital Trends There’s no doubt that Apple’s MacBook Pro 16 is one of the best laptops you can buy today. It’s incredibly well built, offers plenty of power to go with the best efficiency, and its display, keyboard, and touchpad are superior.
Specs and configurations Design Performance Display and audio Portability The Envy 16 is great for budget shoppers, but the MacBook Pro 16 is more refined But, it’s also incredibly expensive. That’s where a laptop like HP’s Envy 16 2023 comes in. It’s also quite fast and well-built, with a gorgeous display option. And it’s a lot less expensive. Can it topple Apple’s mighty MacBook Pro? Specs and configurations HP Envy 16 2023 Apple MacBook Pro 16 Dimensions 14.07 inches by 9.91 inches by 0.78 inches 14.01 inches x 9.77 inches x 0.66 inches Weight 5.12 pounds 4.8 pounds Processor Intel Core i5-13500H Intel Core i7-13700H Intel Core i9-13900H Apple M1 Pro Apple M1 Max Graphics Intel Arc A370M Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 Integrated Apple GPU RAM 16GB DDR5 32GB DDR5 16GB 32GB 64GB (M1 Max) Display 16-inch 16:10 WQXGA (2560 x 1600) IPS, 120Hz 16-inch 16:10 2.8K (2880 x 1800) OLED touch, 120Hz 16.2-inch 16:10 Liquid Retina XDR (3456 x 2234), 120Hz Storage 512GB PCIe Gen4 SSD 1TB PCIe Gen4 SSD 2TB PCIe Gen4 SSD 512GB SSD 1TB SSD 2TB SSD 4TB SSD 8TB SSD Touch Optional No Ports 2 x USB-C with Thunderbolt 4 2 x USB-A 3.2 Gen 2 1 x HDMI 2.1 1 x 3.5mm audio jack 1 x microSD card reader 3 x USB-C 4 with Thunderbolt 4 1 x HDMI 2.0 1 x 3.5mm audio jack 1 x SD Card reader Wireless Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.2 Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3 Webcam 5MP with infrared camera for Windows 11 Hello 1080p Operating system Windows 11 MacOS Monterey Battery 83 watt-hour 100 watt-hour Price $1,350+ $2,499+ Rating 3.5 out of 5 stars 5 out of 5 stars When I reviewed the Envy 16, there were a few configurations available. The entry-level model was priced at $1,350 for a Core i5-13500H, 16GB of RAM , a 512GB SSD, an Intel Arc A370M GPU, and a 16-inch WQXGA IPS display at 120Hz. At the high end, you spend $2,685 for a Core i9-13900H, 32GB of RAM , a 2TB SSD, an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060, and a 2.8K OLED display at 120Hz. We reviewed the $1,750 configuration with the Core i9, 16GB of RAM , a 1TB SSD, the RTX 4060, and the IPS panel.
The MacBook Pro 16 is a much more expensive laptop. It starts at $2,500 for an M2 Pro CPU with 12 CPU cores and 19 GPU cores, 16GB of RAM , a 512GB SSD, and a 16.2-inch Liquid Retina Mini-LED display. Fully configured, you’ll spend a whopping $6,500 for an M2 Max CPU with 12 CPU cores, 38 GPU cores, 96GB of RAM , and an 8TB SSD.
The Envy 16 is a much less expensive laptop, and as we’ll see it provides similar performance. Of course, performance isn’t everything.
Design 1.
HP Envy 16 2.
Apple MacBook Pro 16 The MacBook Pro 16 is carved out of chunks of aluminum, and it feels solid as a rock. Its aesthetic is simple and elegant, exuding quality and finesse. You can’t fault the Envy 16’s built quality or aesthetic, and compared to most other laptops it would hold its own. But the MacBook Pro 16 stands apart among 16-inch laptops in terms of its look and feel. That extends to the little things, like how the hinge opens so smoothly on the MacBook. One thing that some people won’t like about Apple’s machine, though, is the notch in the display that’s used to house the webcam.
The Envy 16’s keyboard is fine, with plenty of travel, large keycaps, nice key spacing, and switches that are light and snappy. Its touchpad is a little small given the available space on the palm rest, but it works well enough with quiet, confident clicks. However, while both input devices are competitive with most other Windows laptops , they can’t hold a candle to the MacBook Pro 16. Apple’s latest Magic Keyboard is the best keyboard you can get on a laptop today, with excellent key spacing and comfortable key size, and switches that aren’t that deep but still provide tons of feedback and precise bottoming action. And the Force Touch haptic touchpad is large and perfect in its responsiveness. It also offers the ability to “press” a little harder and activate additional functionality, something no mechanical keyboard can do.
Connectivity favors the Envy 16 for users who need legacy ports. But the MacBook Pro has an additional Thunderbolt 4 port and a full-size SD card reader to go with an HDMI port. It doesn’t support USB-A, but otherwise, its connectivity is solid. Both laptops use the lasted in wireless connectivity.
The Envy 16 has a 5MP webcam while the MacBook Pro 16 has 1080p, and both offer quality images for videoconferencing. The Envy 16 has an infrared camera for Windows 11 Hello facial recognition, while the MacBook Pro 16 has a Touch ID fingerprint reader. Both methods of logging in without a password worked well.
Performance Mark Coppock/Digital Trends / Digital Trends The Envy 16 is available with a variety of Intel’s 13th-gen 45-watt CPUs, and we reviewed it with the highest-end Core i9-13900H. That’s a 14-core (six Performance and eight Efficient), 20-thread CPU that has provided excellent performance in the laptops we’ve reviewed. Our review unit also equipped the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 GPU.
The MacBook Pro 16 offers a choice of Apple’s M2 Pro or M2 Max CPU, with a variety of core counts ranging from the 12-core CPU/19-core GPU M2 Pro up to the 12-core CPU/38-core GPU M2 Max. We haven’t reviewed the latest 16-inch model, so we’ve used the MacBook Pro 14 with the M2 Max as a proxy. The larger machine is likely to get slightly better performance given better thermals, but these results should be close enough for comparison purposes.
In our CPU-intensive benchmarks, the Envy 16 was faster than both the previous model MacBook Pro 16 and the latest MacBook Pro 14. That’s a significant achievement and cut across both single-core and multi-core scores. In the Pugetbench Premiere Pro benchmark that runs in a live version of Adobe’s Premiere Pro and uses the GPU to speed up various processes, the Envy 16 again took the lead.
It’s possible that the MacBook Pro 16 will provide better performance in apps that are the most optimized for the M2 processor. But for typical applications used by creators, the Envy 16 holds its own. Given the price differential, that’s quite the accomplishment.

It’s not as sharp as the 16.2-inch Mini-LED panel on the MacBook Pro 16 that runs at 3456 x 2234. Nor does it provide even close to the same brightness, color width, or contrast that Apple’s Mini-LED can muster.
Note that the Envy 16 is also available with a 16-inch OLED panel at 2880 x 1800, which still isn’t as sharp but is likely to offer even better colors and equivalent contrast. It won’t be as bright, though, nor will it do as good of a job with high dynamic range ( HDR ) content as the MacBook Pro 16. But then again, the latest MacBook Pros are the best laptops for watching HDR content that you can buy today. Note that all displays run at 120Hz, which makes both Windows 11 and MacOS a much smoother experience.
If you’re a creator, you’ll want the Envy 16’s OLED display, while the IPS panel is fine for productivity work. But overall, the MacBook Pro 16 still offers a superior display.

Its six-speaker setup offers the best audio you can get on a laptop, with surprising depth, incredibly clear mids and highs, and a ton of bass. The Envy 16 does okay with its quad speakers, but the MacBook Pro 16 is simply in a different class entirely.
Portability Digital Trends The MacBook Pro 16 is thinner and lighter than the Envy 16, but they’re both large laptops.
 You’ll definitely notice them as you haul them around in your backpack.
When it comes to battery life, though, the MacBook Pro 16 is once again in a different class. It offers some of the best battery life you can get, and about double what the Envy 16 can achieve. If you need a laptop that can last all day and into another day, then the MacBook Pro 16 is the better choice.

For anyone who needs a fast machine with a great display and has less money to spend, the Envy 16 is a great choice.
But overall, the MacBook Pro 16 remains a vastly more refined experience. Its display is better, its build feels exquisite in hand, and its battery life is better than anything else around. Toss in the best audio in a laptop, and the MacBook Pro 16 is worth every penny.
Editors' Recommendations The MacBook Pro M3 doesn’t have a memory problem — it has a pricing problem Why the MacBook Air is still stuck on the M2 The M3 Max makes the MacBook Pro look like a nearly unbeatable laptop Why it’s still a good time to buy an M2 MacBook Air The best MacBook to buy in 2023 Apple Laptops Computing Right now, the best MacBook Pro laptops come with Liquid Retina XDR displays packed with mini-LED tech, and they’re absolutely incredible. Yet despite their quality, there have been persistent rumors that Apple will switch to OLED screens. Well, we’ve got some bad news if you’ve been holding out for this change.
During a webinar with Bloomberg Intelligence (via MacRumors), display industry expert Ross Young claimed that MacBook Pros bearing OLED panels were still at least three years away from being released. That’s a long time to wait if you’re eager for Apple to make its incredible screens even better.
Computing Apple has a reputation for having expensive devices, so it's always great when we find a good deal on an Apple device, whether it's iPhone deals or iPad deals. Luckily, Amazon's Prime Big Deal Days event is shaping up to be a big deal, with lots of great deals on MacBooks across the board. And, while you can certainly wait until Prime Day itself on October 10th, we're already seeing some amazing MacBook Deals that you can take advantage of right now, and they're likely to still be great deals even by Prime Day.
We're also happy to see that there are great deals across retailers, and not just at Amazon. In fact, we're seeing Prime Day deals on MacBooks at places like Best Buy and Walmart, so if you have any special deals, cards, or coupons you can take advantage of, you're very much in luck. In fact, we're already seeing retailers undercut each other on great MacBook deals, which means more savings for you. So, without wasting too much time, let's jump right into some of the best deals we've found so far during Prime Day 2023.
Today's best Prime Day MacBook deals MacBook Air 11.6-inch (2015) -- from $159 Computing Ever since they changed from Intel processors to Apple silicon chips, Apple’s MacBooks have boasted phenomenal battery life. Now, it looks like the new 16-inch and 14-inch MacBook Pro laptops due out this year could take their battery power even further.
That’s if a new report from DigiTimes (via MacRumors) is to be believed. The outlet has claimed that the new MacBooks -- which it says will launch later this year -- will feature improved displays that are even more power-efficient than the company’s existing ones.
