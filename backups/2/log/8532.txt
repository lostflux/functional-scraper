 While Blizzard‚Äôs convention held an online ceremony in 2021, it has not been hosted as an in-person event since the COVID-19 pandemic began in 2020. That changed today with the 2023 edition, which saw fans returning to the Anaheim Convention Center to get all the news on the studio‚Äôs games.
World of Warcraft gets a huge new saga Cataclysm returns to World of Warcraft Classic Overwatch 2‚Äôs 2024 plans, new heroes previewed We got a glimpse at Diablo 4: Vessel of Hatred Hearthstone gets 50-card packs, co-op Battlegrounds Warcraft Rumble is out now (but you knew that) Phil Spencer lays out a mission statement for Blizzard It all kicked off with an Opening Ceremony that gave players updates on titles like Overwatch 2 , World of Warcraft , and more. It was an especially important moment for Blizzard, as it all took place very shortly after Microsoft completed its acquisition of the company this fall. Due to that move, all eyes were on the BlizzCon stage this year. That wasn‚Äôt lost on the company, which rolled out the big guns. We got an ambitious new DLC plan for World of Warcraft , saw Diablo 4 ‚Äòs new DLC, and even got a cameo from Xbox head Phil Spencer. It was a long show packed with details, but we‚Äôve got them all for you right here.
World of Warcraft gets a huge new saga Journey to the heart of the world.
A story 20 years in the making.
Introducing the tenth expansion of World of Warcraft, The War Within.
pic.twitter.com/rdje36HgaG &mdash; World of Warcraft (@Warcraft) November 3, 2023 World of Warcraft is getting a major story update. Blizzard veteran Chris Metzen revealed an ambitious content plan called the Worldsoul Saga. Metzen says it will take place over three expansions. Blizzard teased not just one, but all three of those expansions during the opening ceremony. The first expansion is dubbed The War Within and will have players exploring a subterranean kingdom. That‚Äôll be followed by Midnight , which takes players back to Quel‚ÄôThalas. Finally, there‚Äôs The Last Titan , set in Northrend.
We got a glimpse at all those plans, with multiple trailers for The War Within.
 One was a live-action trailer that simply teased an emotional story built around an enormous, world-piercing sword. The second clip was far more informative, showing off new features. The expansion adds new zones like the Ringing Deeps and Hallowfall. We also got a rapid fire list of other features: Delves is a new end-game activity, Warbands allow players to link together their characters, and Hero Talents expand customization. The expansion is set to release in fall 2024.
Cataclysm returns to World of Warcraft Classic World of Warcraft Classic: Cataclysm üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Faster Cadence üìà Improved Levelling ü§ù Improved Guild Features üê∫ Worgen and Goblins üó°Ô∏è 10 Dungeons ‚öîÔ∏è 5 Raids And more! pic.twitter.com/XUw08CJyjf &mdash; World of Warcraft (@Warcraft) November 3, 2023 As for the classic version, World of Warcraft is getting a big update in the form of Cataclysm Classic.
For those who don‚Äôt remember, Cataclysm is a critically acclaimed World of Warcraft expansion that released all the way back in 2010. The update is set to launch in the first half of 2024. The Classic version of the MMO is also getting Season of Discovery, which has a level 25 level cap initially. Blizzard will gradually raise that cap, adding in more rewards as it goes. It launches on November 30.
Overwatch 2‚Äôs 2024 plans, new heroes previewed Wonder if anyone saw this coming? üòâ The long-awaited Tank Mauga is the next hero in #Overwatch2 pic.twitter.com/J3duvnTfUr &mdash; Overwatch (@PlayOverwatch) November 3, 2023 Overwatch 2 game director Aaron Keller and other team members took the stage early on to give several updates on the sequel. That started with the reveal of the shooter‚Äôs next hero, Mauga, a Samoan Tank class character with a chain gun on each hand. He has abilities like Overrun, an unstoppable charge, and Cage Fight, which gives his team infinite ammo for a brief time. The character was first introduced in a short story four years ago, so he‚Äôs a long-awaited addition for eagle-eyed fans. He‚Äôll join the roster in season 8, and players can try him for free today.
Keller also teased two new heroes. A hero named Venture is coming in season 10 and another code-named Space Ranger will join the roster in season 12. More details on both will be revealed during the remainder of BlizzCon.
Keller went on to discuss the team‚Äôs new ‚Äúclarity of vision‚Äù that‚Äôs guiding its 2024 road map. The team is making a new PvP game mode called Clash, which is another point-capture variation. That‚Äôs also bringing a new map, Hanaoka, which is a new version of Hanamura. The game will also get a rework of how rewards, seasons, and lore work.
We got a glimpse at Diablo 4: Vessel of Hatred There will be no salvation in the light.
The #VesselofHatred expansion comes to #DiabloIV in late 2024 üê∫ pic.twitter.com/OQQ3ZZU9HU &mdash; Diablo (@Diablo) November 3, 2023 For its Diablo 4 block, Blizzard gave a refresher on what‚Äôs in the current Season of Blood. That includes an experience boost that allows players to hit level 100 much faster. Starting next week, the season will introduce five class-specific rings from the game‚Äôs previous season. On December 5, the game will be getting an enchanting preview to make builds easier. That date will also bring a six-week event called Abbatoir of Zir. A holiday event, dubbed Midwinter Blight, is coming on December 12 (and it may just include a killer Santa Claus).
Blizzard also teased a few additions coming to season 3, including a Gauntlet mode that adds leaderboards. We also got a quick teaser of an upcoming story expansion dubbed Vessel of Hatred.
 That‚Äôs set to release in late 2024 and will include a new region, as well as one from Diablo 2.
 It‚Äôll also come with a brand new class that has never appeared in a Diablo game before, though Blizzard was tight-lipped on what that is. More information on the expansion is coming next summer.
Hearthstone gets 50-card packs, co-op Battlegrounds Tumbleweeds roll by and high noon looms üèúÔ∏è Grab your horse and your hat, it‚Äôs nearly time for a Showdown in the Badlands‚Äîlaunching November 14th! pic.twitter.com/ErfITzDPYp &mdash; Hearthstone (@PlayHearthstone) November 3, 2023 The Hearthstone team gave an overview of the card game‚Äôs next expansion, Showdown in the Badlands.
 A new trailer showed off its Wild West theme and teased a few new cards. It‚Äôll add Reno Lone Ranger, the game‚Äôs first neutral hero card. The expansion launches on November 14.
Blizzard also announced Catch-up Packs, which include up to 50 cards from the last two years. All players are getting some packs, and some will be included in Showdown in the Badlands bundles too. Its unclear how much those cost for those who want to buy them outside of that.
On top of that, Battlegrounds is getting a co-op mode called Battlegrounds Duos. It‚Äôll give teammates a shared health pool and let them trade cards back and forth during battles. The mode is set to launch in early 2024, with more information to come during the rest of the convention.
Warcraft Rumble is out now (but you knew that) The Countdown Starts Now! #WarcraftRumble launches on November 3rd: üîπCollect 65+ Minis üîπChallenge Iconic Warcraft Characters üîπLevel Up Your Army Pre-Register: https://t.co/wTrvaeEosH pic.twitter.com/6FeUy7WDxZ &mdash; Warcraft Rumble (@WarcraftRumble) October 3, 2023 Free-to-play mobile game Warcraft Rumble began rolling out right before BlizzCon began, so it only made sense that it would get a bit of attention during the show. We mostly got an overview of how it works covering dungeons, PvP, raids, and more. Blizzard set the segment up like a surprise shadow drop, though the game was already available nearly a day earlier.
Phil Spencer lays out a mission statement for Blizzard While not exactly an announcement, BlizzCon opened with an important moment as Xbox chief Phil Spencer took the stage. Spencer didn‚Äôt come with any news (like Blizzard games coming to Game Pass), but he did lay out a bit of a mission statement for Xbox‚Äôs relationship with the company. He gave a shout-out to the long-defunct Starcraft series, hinted that Blizzard games are coming to Xbox, and noted that the company will work closely with Blizzard to build its future. It was a big PR moment for the two companies that set the stage for the future without confirming anything new.

https://twitter.com/Blizzard_Ent/status/1658884052110434305 Gaming Activision Blizzard plans to release a new Call of Duty game and mobile Warcraft game in 2022, according to a February 2022 financial results report.
As part of that report, the company went over what investors could expect from Activision, Blizzard, and King in 2022. Notably, a Warcraft game for mobile phones is officially teased for the first time: "Blizzard is planning substantial new content for the Warcraft franchise in 2022, including new experiences in World of Warcraft and Hearthstone, and getting all-new mobile Warcraft content into players‚Äô hands for the first time." We've yet to learn the title of this game or see it in action. It'll be the first Warcraft game released since the disappointing Warcraft 3: Reforged in 2020, and the second to hit iOS and Android, following Hearthstone.
In the same report, Activision discussed Call of Duty in great detail. While the teased Call of Duty game is still untitled, this financial results report and a tweet from Infinity Ward heavily suggest that it's Modern Warfare 2. "Development on this year‚Äôs premium and Warzone experiences is being led by Activision‚Äôs renowned Infinity Ward studio," the results state. "The team is working on the most ambitious plan in franchise history, with industry-leading innovation and a broadly appealing franchise setting." Shortly afterward, Infinity Ward tweeted, "A new generation of Call of Duty is coming soon. Stay frosty." https://twitter.com/InfinityWard/status/1489346822208249861 "Stay frosty" is an iconic line of John "Soap" MacTavish, a classic Modern Warfare character that was only teased in the 2019 reboot. Considering that 2019's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare is widely regarded as the series' best game in recent memory, it's not a surprise that the Modern Warfare 2 rumors are true. A report from Bloomberg claims that this game will still release on PlayStation consoles, which makes sense as the Microsoft acquisition isn't expected to be complete until June 30, 2022.
Despite the acquisition being in progress, developers fighting to unionize, and the delay of Overwatch 2 and Diablo IV, this financial results report confirms that we can still expect new games from Activision Blizzard in 2022.
