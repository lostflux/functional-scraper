Why trust us? JLab jumps into hi-res and Bluetooth LE audio with $200 Epic Lab Edition earbuds By Simon Cohen Close JLab has a reputation for making very affordable headphones and earbuds that also deliver good sound quality and features. But today, the company has decided to try its hand at satisfying a more upscale buyer — its JLab Epic Lab Edition are its first wireless earbuds to promise hi-res audio , as well as its first earbuds to use a hybrid dual-driver architecture. Preorders , with the first orders getting shipped about 12 days later.
JLab The $200 Epic Lab Edition use a dynamic driver along with a Knowles balanced armature driver and are among the first wireless earbuds to be tuned using the Knowles Preferred Listening Response Curve — a sound signature that places a greater emphasis on boosted treble, something that Knowles claims listeners across age ranges and hearing abilities prefer.
Any Android user will be able to take advantage of hi-res audio on the Epic Lab Edition as long as they have access to a source of hi-res music — the earbuds use Sony’s LDAC Bluetooth codec which has been included with Android since version 8 of the software.
JLab The earbuds are also compatible with the new Bluetooth LE Audio specification, which can deliver lower latency audio for gaming applications. Most smartphones and computers aren’t yet ready to deliver LE Audio natively, so JLab has included an LE Audio USB-C dongle inside the Epic Lab Edition’s charging case, so you can enjoy the benefits of LE Audio immediately.
Jabra’s latest wireless earbuds have Dolby spatial audio Audio-Technica’s new flagship earbuds sanitize themselves after every use 1More’s Evo ANC earbuds do wireless hi-res audio for $170 In typical JLab fashion, the Epic Lab Edition possess many additional features including: Wireless charging Bluetooth multipoint A claimed 13+ hours of playtime per charge with a total of 56+ hours when you include the case IP55 protection from dust, sweat, and water Smart active noise cancellation (ANC) that can be tuned using the JLab app Editors' Recommendations Bose revamps QuietComfort headphones and earbuds with lossless, hi-res, and spatial audio Nothing might launch new hi-res earbuds at CES under the XO brand Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 3 get Bluetooth multipoint and hi-res audio Beats Fit Pro offer secure fit, ANC, and head-tracking spatial audio for $200 Soundcore Liberty 3 Pro earbuds go after Sony’s wireless hi-res crown Headphones Tech News Audio / Video Grell Audio isn't a household name, but its founder, Axel Grell, is something of a legend in the audiophile community. As Sennheiser's lead headphones designer for the better part of 30 years, he was a driving force behind the company's line of highly regarded audio products, like the pricey but extraordinary HD800 and HD800S. Now, out on his own, Grell has his sights set on a new goal: To produce a set of true wireless earbuds that don't compromise on sound quality and, perhaps more importantly, don't cost the equivalent of lease payment on a Ferrari. His first attempt is embodied in the Grell TWS/1, a slick-looking set of earbuds that cost $200, and can be pre-ordered from the Grell Audio website starting today and shipping expected by November.
"I always try to create the best possible acoustical experience for the money, no matter the price point," said Axel Grell in a press release. The TWS/1 features and specs seem to support Grell's statement. With the exception of active noise cancellation (ANC), most of the embedded tech appears geared toward a higher standard of audio performance: High precision dynamic drivers, dynamic transducers with a tolerance of +/- 1 db, and strong support for high-quality Bluetooth codecs like SBC, AAC, aptX, aptX HD, aptX adaptive, and LHDC. Grell has even included Sonarworks' SoundID personalized tuning software to help folks adapt the sound of the TWS/1 to their particular hearing profile.
Audio / Video Editor's note: Prior to the official launch of its new true wireless earbuds, Technics provided Digital Trends with pricing information for the EAH-AZ40 and AZ60. This set the price of the AZ40 at $130 and the AZ60 at $200, which we initially reported. However, following the launch, Technics informed us that the pricing had been changed. We've adjusted the prices accordingly in the article below.
Following on the heels of the EAH-AZ70, its first set of noise-canceling true wireless earbuds, Technics is back with two new true wireless models that are more compact and offer better call quality than their predecessor. The $230 EAH-AZ60 come in silver and black, and the $150 EAH-AZ40 can be ordered in silver, black, and rose gold. Both models will be available in October. In the U.S., the EAH-AZ60 replaces the AZ70.
Audio / Video Edifier, a company that has been making a name for itself as a designer of audio gear that offers very good quality at affordable prices, is taking to Indiegogo for its latest product: The NeoBuds Pro. The $99 true wireless earbuds offer active noise cancellation (ANC), plus a feature that is hard to find at any price -- hi-res audio. Pre-orders start now and Edifier says they will ship in August, which is also when we can expect the NeoBuds Pro to show up at retailers like Amazon.
Edifier's Indiegogo campaign page claims that the NeoBuds Pro are the "first hi-res ANC earbuds," but technically, that title belongs to Sony, which introduced the hi-res-capable WF-1000XM4 earlier in 2021. Edifier's press release makes a more nuanced (and more accurate) statement, in which it says, "the Neobuds Pro are the first hi-res-certified, noise-canceling, truly wireless earphones in the market that boast a dynamic driver, Knowles balanced armature, and LHDC+ACC codec."
