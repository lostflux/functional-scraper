White Close ITHome / MSI A new RDNA 2 GPU in 2023? While it sounds unlikely, it’s true. MSI has just introduced a few prebuilt gaming desktops equipped with various AMD processors and graphics cards, and one of them is the previously unreleased Radeon RX 6750 GRE, which stands for “Golden Rabbit Edition.” While it may not rival some of the best GPUs , rumor has it that it’ll at least beat Nvidia’s RTX 4060 Ti while being just a little pricier than the RTX 4060.
Gigabyte has actually beaten MSI to the punch with the announcement, having revealed its own RX 6750 GRE graphics card first. However, while the Gigabyte GPU is set to be released on October 18, MSI already has a bunch of desktops up for grabs, although we’re not seeing a DIY card that you could put into your own system. It just comes as part of MSI’s prebuilts, which were first spotted by ITHome and later shared by VideoCardz.
The exact specs of the card are a mystery, but we know that it’ll sport 12GB of VRAM, which is the same as the RX 6750 XT. MSI stated that the new GPU will be comparable in performance to the RTX 4060 Ti, which most likely means the 8GB version. Even if not, it’s all the same, as the 16GB model has comparable (or worse) performance.
Why AMD’s biggest competitor is no longer Nvidia This new GPU connector may finally kill the melting 12VHPWR Asus’ new RTX 4090 shattered GPU overclocking records, and you’ll be able to buy it soon In MSI’s case, the GPU comes in systems where it’s paired with some of AMD’s top processors, such as the Ryzen 7 7700X or the Ryzen 5 7500F. The listing claims that the 7700X model comes with 16GB of DDR4 memory, but that doesn’t sound right, as the AM5 platform doesn’t support DDR4 at all. It’s safe to assume MSI meant DDR5 for both configurations. We’re likely looking at a cutdown Navi 22 chip here, so the RX 6750 XT will still remain more powerful.
Aroged / Gigabyte It’s hard to judge a GPU inside a prebuilt based on pricing, but according to the prices at a Chinese retailer, the RX 6750 GRE and the RTX 4060 are both very close in price. The AMD offering is only around 2% to 4% more expensive, which is a very reasonable increase if it can offer the performance of the RTX 4060 Ti.
So, what’s the catch? The GRE in the RX 6750 GRE stands for “Golden Rabbit Edition,” as the GPU was named in celebration of the Year of the Rabbit in China. You guessed it — this is a China exclusive. It could end up being an interesting blast from the past and a solid budget GPU, but we’re unlikely to ever see it hit the global market.
Editors' Recommendations Nvidia may launch three new Super GPUs to fight back AMD There’s only one use for an RTX 4080 Ti, and it’s not what you think Someone tweaked AMD’s RX 7800 XT, and the results may surprise you AMD might still have some next-gen GPUs left in the tank — but I don’t buy it I tested AMD’s RX 7800 XT against Nvidia’s RTX 4070, and there’s a clear winner News GPUs Tech News Computing AMD has just unveiled two new graphics cards aimed at gamers -- the Radeon RX 7800 XT and the RX 7700 XT. Set to rival some of the best graphics cards in this generation, the two GPUs are a way to bridge the gap in AMD's modest RDNA 3 lineup. AMD teases that both cards are suited for 1440p gaming, which could help them compete in the mainstream gaming market.
The prices are what stand out: the RX 7800 XT starts at $500, while the RX 7700 XT goes for $450. That significantly undercuts Nvidia's RTX 4070 at $600, though the RX 7700 XT is more expensive than the RTX 4060 Ti at $450. Nvidia could really use some competition, so let's hope that AMD's new GPUs will be powerful enough to make a dent in Nvidia's market domination.
Computing The days of the GPU shortage are long over, but somehow, buying a GPU is harder than ever -- and that sentiment has very little to do with stock levels. It's just that there are no obvious candidates when shopping anymore.
In a generation where no single GPU stands out as the single best graphics card, it's hard to jump on board with the latest from AMD and Nvidia. I don't want to see another GPU shortage, but the state of the graphics card market is far from where it should be.
This generation is all over the place Computing Update: AMD has released an urgent hotfix to fix the driver problem that was causing the issue with ray tracing support, which you can download and use here.
