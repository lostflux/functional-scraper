You’re more likely to be the last squad standing if you communicate effectively with your team. Sure, playing with randoms will sometimes lead you to victory, but you’ll have a much easier time if you squad up with friends.
How to invite friends via Social How to invite friends via Channels Unfortunately, the first couple of days of Warzone 2.0 were rough — as there were a few bugs that hampered the experience around its launch. One issue caused players to be unable to invite friends to a party in-game, which is frustrating for those looking to squad up. This meant that users had to rely on playing with randoms, or use a workaround to actually get into a party with friends. Thankfully, this issue has seemingly been fixed, but navigating the menus is a bit of a chore. In this guide, we’ll show you how to invite players to a party so you can spend more time gaming with friends.

How to invite friends via Social Image used with permission by copyright holder The standard way to invite friends and party up is via the Social menu, which is what was broken on launch day. It seems to be fixed now, and here’s how it works: From the game menu, press the Options/Menu button to bring up a selection of choices in the top right of the screen. Navigate to Social , and you’ll see a few options including Your Party and Social Activity.

Gamescom Opening Night Live 2023: how to watch and what to expect Activision teases Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III’s biggest improvements By selecting Your Party, you’ll come to a screen that shows all your Warzone 2.0 and Modern Warfare II friends. From here, you can invite these players to your party. Note that you can also adjust your party settings from the Your Party menu, as well. This is key for players wanting to prevent friends from joining them, among other options, as well.
How to invite friends via Channels Image used with permission by copyright holder When the Social option was busted, there was a workaround that allowed players to invite friends via the Channels menu. In case the Social menu breaks again, or if you want another way to invite friends, it’s a good idea to be aware of how to use Channels.
To access Channels, first, press the Options/Menu button just like before. Then, tab over to Channels , and you’ll see an option called Game Channels.
 From here, you can invite players just like you can from the Social menu.
Editors' Recommendations The best Call of Duty games, ranked How to access the Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 beta Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III trailer teases a No Russian reimagining Does Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 have Hardcore mode? The best Warzone FR Avancer loadout Gaming Call of Duty: Warzone season 5 has kicked off with two brand new weapons, including the Carrack .300 sniper rifle (aka the WA 2000). This sniper works a lot like it did in past iterations, with a fast fire rate and, unfortunately, low damage. That's the thing about the Carrack .300: It's extremely difficult to use in its current state, regardless of the map you're on. But if you're looking for a challenge, or a weapon to attempt to troll your opponents with, the Carrack .300 might be up your alley. Here's the best Carrack .300 in Warzone.
The best Carrack .300 loadout Recommended loadout: Gaming Activision has confirmed a November 10 release date for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III with a teaser trailer following a barrage of leaks.
The shooter, which is going to be a direct sequel to 2022's Modern Warfare II, was the subject of lots of reports and leaks prior to this announcement. Reports from Bloomberg revealed that this game was originally going to be a Modern Warfare II expansion, but it later got upgraded to a full game. Then, over the summer, more game details started to leak before some Monster Energy advertisements revealed the game's title prematurely. Activision coyly acknowledged this leak on Twitter at the time, but finally pulled the curtain back on the project today with a video titled "Modern Warfare III is Coming." Modern Warfare III is Coming It begins with some green soundwaves on-screen and a lot of radio chatter in the background. Then, the soundwaves turn from green to red before the perspective then pushes into them, creating a trippy red void. In there, we briefly see waveform images of a snake and Captain Price before he says, "Never bury your enemies alive" over the silhouette of a new character. This is believed to be Vladimir Makarov, the villain of the original Modern Warfare trilogy, who was teased in the post-credit scene for last year's campaign. After all of that, the title Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III is confirmed, as is the release date of November 10.
This date falls right in line with the late October to early November window in which Call of Duty games usually come out. It also places its launch after Microsoft's Activision Blizzard acquisition is expected to be complete, so it looks like this may be the first Call of Duty game released under Microsoft. Other than that date, official details on the game are fairly scarce. Thankfully, we shouldn't have to wait too much longer to learn more.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III launches on November 10.
Gaming Your performance in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 has a lot to do with the weapon you come equipped with. Sure, a skilled player can excel with most weapons in the game, but having the best firearm for any given situation will lead you to more victories -- regardless of your playstyle. Modern Warfare 2 has around 50 primary weapons across seven categories, each with different stats, strengths, and weaknesses.
The meta in Call of Duty games shifts constantly as weapons are added and tweaked, so it's always a good idea to stay on top of the latest updates. In this guide, we'll rank each primary weapon in Modern Warfare 2 across all categories (with the exception of the Riot Shield). This ranking is in descending order, with the first spot being the best and the last spot being the worst. We'll also link to loadout guides for the weapons on this list so you know exactly which attachments to use.
