If I own the first or second-gen AirPods , should I upgrade? And, is it still worth the extra money for the $249 AirPods Pro ? I’ll save you some time.

Apple AirPods (left), AirPods 3 (middle), and AirPods Pro.
The design of the third-gen AirPods — which we’ll now refer to as the AirPods 3 — for all intents and purposes makes them look like the missing link between the original AirPods and the AirPods Pro. That in-between impression is the story of the AirPods 3 in a nutshell: They take the best parts of each of those other models in an attempt to create the perfect middle ground, with that same in-between price. If this was Apple’s goal, I think it succeeded wildly.
Fans of semi-open earbuds no longer have to accept mediocre sound quality.
The AirPods 3 sit firmly in the Goldilocks zone — they improve on the second-gen AirPods in every meaningful way, while coming in at a lower price than you used to have to pay for the second-gen AirPods with wireless charging, and considerably less than the AirPods Pro at their regular price.
Even their charging case is a best-of-both-worlds situation, with Qi and MagSafe-compatible wireless charging and yet with dimensions that make it almost exactly the same size and shape as the original AirPods case.
Bigger, better sound Simon Cohen / Digital Trends / Digital Trends The original AirPods earned a lot of fans for their wire-free convenience, simplicity, and easy integration with the iPhone. But most would admit that when it comes to sound quality, they’re OK at best — barely an improvement over the performance of the wired EarPods that Apple ships with its iPhones. And despite using a semi-open design, just like the original AirPods, the AirPods 3 sound far better.
Head-tracking spatial audio is like sitting in on a studio session with your favorite band.
In fact, as long as you’re in a quiet location, the AirPods 3 sound every bit as good as the AirPods Pro. There’s plenty of clarity through the various frequencies and, much to my surprise, they have a bass response that is both warm and powerful. They can’t compete with closed designs like the Jabra Elite 7 Pro or Sony’s WF-1000XM4 , but I put them head-to-head with other semi-open buds like the AirPods, Marshall Minor III , Soundpeats Air 3, Urbanista Lisbon, and the Earin A3 , and the AirPods 3 trounced them all. Fans of semi-open earbuds no longer have to accept mediocre sound quality.
Get spatial Simon Cohen / Digital Trends / Digital Trends Apple has been making a big deal about spatial audio and Dolby Atmos ever since it added tracks to Apple Music that use this immersive format. And while pretty much any set of wired or wireless headphones can enjoy Atmos when listening to select Apple Music songs, the AirPods 3 up the ante with head-tracking spatial audio.
The feature — which the new AirPods share with the AirPods Pro and AirPods Max — takes the already immersive quality of Dolby Atmos music and adjusts some of the song elements in real-time to react to your head movements. The lead vocalist(s) is “pinned” to the direction your head faces, such that when you turn your head one way or the other, that singer’s voice sounds like it’s still coming from the same forward direction. It’s a little like sitting in on a studio session with your favorite band.
A more bulbous (yet super smooth) shape makes them more secure without compromising on comfort.
Like Dolby Atmos music itself, the effect can vary hugely from track to track. But when it’s done right, like on Imagine Dragons’ new album Mercury – Act 1 , it’s a wild ride.
 Older material that has been remixed for spatial audio, like The Rolling Stones classic, Tattoo You , doesn’t fare as well as newer works (sorry Mick and Keith).
This same head-tracking works on movie soundtracks too , and I’d argue it’s an even better use of the tech as it can simulate what it’s like to sit in a full surround sound theater, using just your earbuds.
You may not use head-tracking spatial audio a lot (and you can disable it entirely if you don’t like the way it sounds) but it’s a cool feature that helps to justify the purchase of the AirPods 3 even when there are so many great true wireless earbuds out there.
Comfy curves Simon Cohen / Digital Trends Another common complaint about the first AirPods is that even though they’re very comfortable, they just don’t feel very secure in your ears. This, along with their lack of any official water or sweat protection, has kept some folks from using them for running or other high-impact activities.
The AirPods 3 manage to (mostly) address both concerns. With a more bulbous (yet super smooth) shape, they make much better contact with the skin of the outer ear and that — along with their shorter stem — makes them more secure without compromising on comfort. If you like the way the AirPods 2 fit, you should be quite happy with the AirPods 3. They’re not as secure as the AirPods Pro, which means you may need to adjust them periodically, especially if you use the force sensor controls a lot — pinching the stems to activate it can inadvertently move the earbuds around, especially while running.
But they do have an IPX4 rating for water resistance , so go ahead and get as sweaty as you please.
Find a nice, quiet spot While the AirPods 3 sound quality really is remarkable given their semi-open design, with no silicone ear tips, they can’t provide much of a seal, and lots of external noise makes its way into your ears along with your music. In even moderately noisy environments, you’re forced to crank the volume to hear your podcasts or phone calls.
This is where the AirPods Pro have a huge advantage. Not only do they provide better passive noise isolation thanks to those silicone ear tips, but they also have active noise cancellation (ANC) which can silence all but the most intrusive outside sounds.
On the other hand, because the AirPods 3 let so much sound in, there’s almost no reason to remove them to have a conversation, and thus the lack of transparency mode is no big deal. If you want to be more aware of your surroundings, simply pause the music.
Competent calling Simon Cohen / Digital Trends Call quality on the original AirPods was never perfect, but it was always perfectly adequate. That remains true of the AirPods 3. You should have no trouble being heard even in moderately noisy places. Clarity isn’t quite as good as you’ll get with the AirPods Pro, but it’s good enough for most situations.
A slightly bigger battery Previous Next 1 5 Apple AirPods (left), AirPods 3 (middle), and AirPods Pro.
Simon Cohen / Digital Trends Simon Cohen / Digital Trends / Digital Trends Simon Cohen / Digital Trends Simon Cohen / Digital Trends Apple AirPods 3 charging case (left), and AirPods Pro charging case.
Simon Cohen / Digital Trends We’ve taken Apple to task over the AirPods and AirPods Pro battery life because so many other true wireless earbuds manage to offer longer play time on a single charge and more total battery time too. So it’s great to see that Apple has managed to eke out just a bit more from the AirPods 3’s battery: Six hours per charge, and 30 hours of total time when you factor in the charging case.
That’s still shy of some of the more long-lasting earbuds, but it’s still the best we’ve seen in a set of AirPods. Given that they still support hands-free Siri (one of the biggest draws on battery life), it’s a pretty big accomplishment.
The fast-charge feature gives you about an extra hour of listening time if you charge the buds for five minutes.
Our take With way better sound, a bigger battery, a more secure fit, wireless charging, and head-tracking spatial audio, the AirPods 3 are a big step-up from the second-gen AirPods and an upgrade that all AirPod owners should consider.
Is there a better alternative? The only set of semi-open earbuds that sound as good as the AirPods 3 are the Oddict Twigs. However, they lack wireless charging, head-tracking spatial audio, hands-free Siri, and their three-hour battery life is among the lowest we’ve ever seen.
A better alternative is the first-gen Apple AirPods Pro, which you can still routinely find on sale for between $180-$200 (the updated version with MagSafe charging may cost a few dollars more). With ANC and transparency mode, a more secure fit, and better sound, they’re the logical step-up from the AirPods 3. But a lot of folks don’t like the feeling of silicone ear tips, which brings us back to the AirPods 3.
How long will they last? With IPX4 water protection and very solid build quality, I’m certain the hardware itself will last for many years of use. But Apple has had problems in the past with the batteries in its AirPods losing a lot of their capacity in the first two years. I can’t say if Apple’s new optimized battery charging feature will significantly reduce this issue, so if you’re concerned about it, it might be worth buying Apple Care to extend your warranty from one year to two years.
Should you buy them? If you’re an Apple device user, absolutely. The AirPods 3 are a worthy upgrade from the first AirPods. Android owners won’t be able to take advantage of features like head-tracking spatial audio or hands-free Siri, making them less appealing for thse folks.
Editors' Recommendations New AirPods teased for 2024, to little surprise Best Apple TV deals: Get the streaming device from just $34 Best AirPods Max deals: Get the noise-canceling headphones for $384 When it comes to charging AirPods Pro with USB-C, don’t overthink it Apple has upgraded the AirPods Pro with lossless audio, sort of AirPods Apple Headphone Reviews Headphones Product Reviews Audio / Video In one of the least-kept surprises of today's iPhone 15 event, Apple announced that the second-generation AirPods Pro are switching to USB-C for their charging case.
That's a big deal because they'll now use the same charger as the iPad and MacBook — and also because they can use any other USB-C cable that you've got laying around. And because we're not talking about a device with a huge battery capacity, you don't need to worry so much about whether you have the right USB-C cable. Things should charge just fine, and fast enough, given that the battery case only sports a 523 mAh battery.
Audio / Video So, you just bought yourself a nice new pair of AirPods, or you're thinking about it because they're among the best wireless earbuds you can buy, and you're wondering if they're waterproof. The answer is no, AirPods are not waterproof and you should not wear them while swimming or in the shower or during a water balloon fight. But, if the pair of AirPods you've got (or got your eye on) is either the third-generation AirPods or the first or second-generation AirPods Pro, then you're in luck as they are water resistant.
We're going to get into what all that means and break down how water resistant each AirPods model is and what their water-resistance ratings mean for your daily activities. Let's go.
Water resistant vs. waterproof As we mentioned above, none of Apple's AirPods -- AirPods, AirPods Pro, or AirPod Max -- are waterproof. But what is "waterproof" anyway? From an electronic device standpoint, being waterproof means that the device is watertight and can be completely submerged in water. There's a common ratings system designed for electronics to measure this (as well as dust and dirt resistance) known as the IP (Ingress Protection) rating, which we cover in our post on the water-resistance rating system.
Audio / Video Some of the most popular Apple deals for people are to do with AirPods. The earphones are incredibly simple to use and a must-have for anyone already part of the Apple ecosystem. Must have they may be but that doesn't mean you have to pay full price for them. That's why we've picked out all the best AirPods deals currently available so you can save whether you're looking to buy the cheapest AirPods or the high-end AirPods Max. Let's take a look at what's out there and answer any other questions you may have.
Today's best AirPods deals Depending on if you prefer AirPods that can be charged entirely wirelessly or if you don't mind needing a Lightning cable, you have plenty of options. The standard Apple AirPods (2nd gen) are highly affordable but if you can, stretch to the Apple AirPods Pro (2nd gen) with wireless charging and fantastic active noise cancellation to block out the surrounding world while you exercise. For staying at home and watching movies, you can't go wrong with the Apple AirPods Max either.
Do AirPods come with free Apple Music? Yes, AirPods come with free Apple Music so you instantly have an extensive library of music at your disposal. All you need to do is make sure that your iPhone or iPad is running the latest version of iOS or iPadOS. From there, pair the AirPods to the device, then open the Apple Music app. Once you open it and sign in with your Apple ID, you simply need to tap 'Get 6 months free' to start your six months of Apple Music without having to pay a cent. The deal is eligible with all AirPods listed above, as well as many Beats and the HomePod range too.
Can you try AirPods before you buy them? If you head to an Apple store, you can try AirPods on before buying them, checking they're the right shape and size for you. However, if you're buying online, you're mostly committed to the purchase. You could try Amazon's return policy but it's likely you'll pay some of the cost even if it's just shipping expenses.
