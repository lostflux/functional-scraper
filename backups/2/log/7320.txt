Just one day later, Google has now sent out invites for its latest Made by Google event happening this October — where we expect to see the Google Pixel 8.
You can see the invite above, which confirms that Google is holding an in-person event where it’s going to “introduce the latest additions to our Pixel portfolio of devices.” The event is happening on Wednesday, October 4, 2023, in New York City, and it will (presumably) be livestreamed for folks to watch at home.
Although the event doesn’t tease any of the upcoming announcements, we have a pretty good idea of what to expect. This is almost certainly where Google will announce the Pixel 8 and the Pixel 8 Pro — the successors to last year’s Google Pixel 7 and Google Pixel 7 Pro , respectively.
Google Pixel 8 render MySmartPrice We don’t expect any drastic changes for the Pixel 8 series, though there are some notable upgrades to be on the lookout for. Specifically, we should get a new Tensor G3 processor for both phones, a slightly tweaked design, and a boost to 12GB RAM from the 8GB from last year.
The Google Pixel 8 Pro is also likely to have a new temperature sensor on the back near its cameras. One leak shows the sensor acting as a thermometer to take someone’s temperature, which is … interesting. It seems like a pretty niche addition on paper, though we’re curious to see how it integrates with the Google Pixel Watch and maybe even the Fitbit app.
Speaking of the Pixel Watch , this October 4 event is where we will likely see the Google Pixel Watch 2.
 Rumors about the Pixel Watch 2 have been much harder to come by, but we’re expecting a similar design with under-the-hood upgrades targeting performance and battery life.
Google could also surprise us with updates to the Google Pixel Tablet, its Pixel Buds lineup, or maybe a brand new gadget entirely. But the Pixel 8 lineup and the Pixel Watch 2 will be the stars of the show, and we’ll be there to see everything that’s new.
Editors' Recommendations Double Tap is the coolest Apple Watch feature I’ve used in ages How I use my Apple Watch and iPhone to manage my diabetes I’ve had the Google Pixel 8 Pro for a month. Here’s why I’m keeping it Google’s Pixel phones are in trouble Subscriptions are quickly ruining fitness trackers Android Google Google Pixel Tech News Wearables Mobile Google has started seeding a new software update for its Pixel phones, which also happens to be the first one for its latest Google Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro models The update notes don’t mention the arrival of any new features, but the update does fix crucial problems that users have been complaining about in online forums for months and apply to the Pixel 8 series as well as its predecessors.
At the top of the list is a solution for display- and graphics-related woes, including the problem of “a green flash when the display is turning off in certain conditions.” Google’s post mentions a specific scenario where the green screen issue appears, but users have been reporting it for a while.
Moreover, the “green goblin for Pixels” manifests itself in various ways. One user shared an image of the Pixel 8 Pro on Reddit with a vertical green line running across the screen. Others mention random screen flashing or a permanent tint on the panels, both partial and full-screen. The reports date back at least a couple of years and seem to affect phones as old as the Pixel 6 series.
Previous Mobile I really like the Apple Watch Ultra, but I also like watches in general. Recently, I was in a situation where I didn’t need to track any activity but still wanted to wear a tough watch that not only fitted in with a muddy, grubby, harsh environment — but could cope with it should the need arise.
I turned to the recently released Casio G-Shock GW-9500 Mudman, and while it’s not a smartwatch, it was the perfect choice for the day. Later, I wondered if this Bluetooth-free, seemingly indestructible watch could actually be an alternative to the Apple Watch Ultra. Is it? Here's what I learned.
The right watch for off-roading My Land Rover for the day — before it got very muddy indeed Andy Boxall / Digital Trends Mobile Every fall, there’s lots of pumpkin spice, spooks, and flagship phones from Google and Apple. This year, Google released the powerful Google Pixel 8 Pro, while Apple upped the ante with the iPhone 15 Pro.
While the Google Pixel 8 Pro is more comparable to the iPhone 15 Pro Max, we wanted to see how it would do against the smaller iPhone 15 Pro as well. After all, the regular iPhone 15 Pro is still considered a flagship, and both phones share the same $999 price tag.
