Blu, a domesticated macaw accustomed to his suburban life in Minnesota, is taken to Rio de Janeiro to meet his mate, Jewel, and save his dwindling species.
The two form an affectionate bond, but then find themselves fighting for their freedom after being captured by exotic animal smugglers. While it might not measure up to the best of Pixar’s biggest highlights, families should find plenty to love in director Carlos Saldanha’s charming adventure thanks to its inspired music, visuals, and talented voice cast.
Read less Rio 2 (2014) new 101m Animation, Adventure, Comedy, Family Jesse Eisenberg, Anne Hathaway, Will.i.am Carlos Saldanha watch on Disney+ watch on Disney+ Director Carlos Saldanha returns for Rio 2 , delivering a sequel that expands the scope of its predecessor. After Blu and Jewel establish their new life in Rio de Janeiro, the pair of blue macaws decide to take their budding family for a trip to the Amazon Rainforest to keep them from falling too deep into the habits of city life.
Things get more complicated for Blu, as this family vacation throws an intimidating father-in-law and a new rival in his way.
Rio 2 juggles several new plot points, perhaps even too many for its own good, but the returning voice cast, eye-popping art direction, and music should still satisfy the young ones in the family looking for a fun, breezy time.
Read less Up (2009) 96m Animation, Comedy, Family, Adventure Ed Asner, Christopher Plummer, Jordan Nagai Pete Docter watch on Disney+ watch on Disney+ Perhaps one of the best Pixar Animation Studio movies of the last 20 years, Up is one of the most emotionally rewarding family-centric animated films. Directed by Pete Docter and Bob Peterson, Up tells the story of a 78-year-old balloon salesman who loses his once passionate ambition for traveling the world as his life passes him by and a personal tragedy dampens his desire to live to his potential.
That is, at least until the day he decides to tie thousands of balloons to his house and fly to South America — and an endearing 8-year-old stowaway unexpectedly joins him. Should families feel up for a family-friendly adventure that will inspire joy as much as it does tears, Up is a profoundly resonant comedy-drama.

The group goes on a road trip with their new family including the endearing Forky, a toy made by Bonnie, but it spirals into a hectic adventure when the makeshift toy jumps out from the RV. Nostalgic fans and young newcomers alike will find much to enjoy with Toy Story 4 , as the lovable cast of characters and emotional story are as satisfying as families would hope.

 As nostalgic fans would come to know, Peter Pan & Wendy revolves around the titular duo traveling to Neverland along with the equally beloved character Tinker Bell.
Along the way, the group comes to face off against the villainous Captain Hook. Lowery’s live-action version doesn’t measure up to the original, but it’s a solid modernized rendition to engage the younger ones in the family.
Read less Finding Dory (2016) 97m Adventure, Animation, Comedy, Family Albert Brooks, Ellen DeGeneres, Ed O'Neill Andrew Stanton watch on Disney+ watch on Disney+ The original Finding Nemo was a critically-acclaimed classic of the early 2000s, still standing as one of Disney Pixar’s greatest animated movies to date. Thirteen years later, Finding Dory lived up to its predecessor’s reputation, with Ellen DeGeneres and Albert Brooks returning to reprise their roles as Dory and Marlin.
The story sees the titular amnesiac fish lose herself on a journey to reconnect with her parents.
Finding Dory should satisfy those who grew up on the first movie and new viewers all the same, as it was equally praised for its heartfelt story and clever humor.
Read less Toy Story 3 (2010) 103m Animation, Family, Comedy Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Joan Cusack Lee Unkrich watch on Disney+ watch on Disney+ The Toy Story franchise is still one of Pixar’s most beloved properties, and 15 years after the original movie, Toy Story 3 still successfully tugs at the heartstrings. The third movie in this series follows Woody, Buzz, and company as they’re accidentally donated to a daycare center after a now 17-year-old Andy moves out to college.
From there, the various iconic toys are forced to decide where they belong and how to get back to their home.
Toy Story 3 is a massive payoff of what the 1995 classic started, representing a coming-of-age theme packed with emotion.
Read less Chang Can Dunk (2023) new 108m Family, Comedy, Drama Bloom Li, Dexter Darden, Ben Wang Jingyi Shao watch on Disney+ watch on Disney+ Disney+ every so often releases delightful, small-scale original movies that are charming for the whole family.
Chang Can Dunk follows the story of the titular 16-year-old high schooler (played by Bloom Li), who makes a bet that he can dunk a basketball by Homecoming. However, that’s quite the challenge given the fact that he’s 5 feet, 8inches tall. But Chang’s determination to do so results in so much more than he imagined.
He ends up going through some self-discovery along the way, learning the importance of overcoming obstacles, maintaining a sense of identity, and having a strong support system. A timeless series of messages make Chang Can Dunk a worthwhile coming-of-age dramedy for the whole household.
Read less Finding Nemo (2003) 100m Animation, Family Albert Brooks, Ellen DeGeneres, Alexander Gould Andrew Stanton watch on Disney+ watch on Disney+ There’s little that can be said of Finding Nemo that hasn’t been already, as the 2003 movie was one of animation and Disney’s best theatrical achievements that decade.
The movie revolves around an overprotective clownfish father named Marlin as he and his bubbly yet forgetful friend, Dory — a regal blue tang — embark on an ocean-wide journey to find his lost son. Its brand of charm, genuinely clever humor, and visual spectacles have hardly aged, and its themes ensure that Finding Nemo will forever be a Disney Pixar classic all ages can get behind.
Read less The Peanuts Movie (2015) 88m Comedy, Animation, Family Noah Schnapp, Bill Melendez, Marleik 'Mar Mar' Walker Steve Martino watch on Disney+ watch on Disney+ The Peanuts characters are pop culture icons, and the 2015 animated movie beautifully and lovingly put that on display for the modern age. The film sees the beloved Charlie Brown and Snoopy go off on their respective exploits, with the former continuing to try to win the affection of the Little Red-Haired Girl, while Snoopy aims to write a book about him as a World War I flying ace going on a daring rescue mission.
The Peanuts Movie earned high critical praise, largely for its vibrant art direction that still stays faithful to the tone of the comic strips, while effectively catering to both the new generation and the older, nostalgic fans who grew up with Peanuts.
Read less Toy Story 2 (1999) 92m Animation, Comedy, Family Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Joan Cusack John Lasseter watch on Disney+ watch on Disney+ The Toy Story series is one of the most critically acclaimed and iconic Disney Pixar creations of all time, and the 1999 sequel still holds up as well as the rest. Following up a beloved original is always a tall order, but Toy Story 2 satisfied on all fronts, introducing new and lovable characters alongside an equally emotional story.
Following the shocking events of Woody being stolen by a crazed toy collector, Buzz Lightyear and the rest of the toy gang go on a daring mission to rescue him. But when Woody meets Jessie, the former is tempted by the thought of “immortality” in a museum.
Toy Story 2 ‘s character-driven story earned widespread acclaim, and is arguably superior to its predecessor.

She headlines the cast as Miss Eglantine Price a woman in 1940s England who is learning to be a witch through a correspondence course in the hopes of saving her country from the Nazis. Miss Price reluctantly takes in three orphans: Charles (Ian Weighill), Carrie (Cindy O’Callaghan), and Paul Rawlins (Roy Snart). When the siblings discover that Price is a witch, she swears them to secrecy. They also accompany Price when she goes on a magical journey alongside Emelius Browne (David Tomlinson), a con man who also comes to care for the makeshift family.

Entertainment First, the good news: the actors' strike is over. The bad news is that a combined six-plus months of strikes in Hollywood means there's bound to be a slowdown in new shows in 2024. But since we're still living in 2023 for the next month-and-a-half, we've still got plenty of fresh scripted content to enjoy. This week, we're throwing the spotlight on Apple TV+'s signature series, For All Mankind, Max's Rap Sh!t, and Netflix's Blue Eye Samurai, an anime show that seems to be on the verge of becoming a crossover hit.
Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, Max, Apple TV+, Disney+, Paramount+, and Peacock have spent a lot of money keeping us in fresh new shows week after week. Unfortunately, that's why most of those streaming services are hiking their rates. That's why we suggest going with the ad-supported tiers. In the meantime, keep reading for our weekly roundup of the best new shows to stream.
