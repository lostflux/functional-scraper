Prior reports have suggested that the development of GPT-5 is already underway. However, Altman recently spoke at an event at MIT and addressed the open letter and petition that has been circulated among the tech community calling for OpenAI to halt the progress of language models beyond GPT-4.
 The letter, which has been published on the Future of Life Institute website has been supported by several technology leaders, including Elon Musk, Steve Wozniak, and Andrew Yang, among others.

In response, at the MIT event, Altman said, the letter lacked “most technical nuance about where we need the pause.” The executive also noted that the letter had been updated to remove claims that OpenAI was already training GPT-5. “We are not and won’t for some time. So in that sense, it was sort of silly,” he added.
GPT-4 Turbo is the biggest update since ChatGPT’s launch OpenAI’s new tool can spot fake AI images, but there’s a catch This powerful ChatGPT feature is back from the dead — with a few key changes It should be noted that GPT-4.5, which is supposed to built off the current model, is officially scheduled to be due out later this year.
The Verge noted that the letter itself has been criticized within the tech industry, even by many who have signed it, with experts not being clear on the exact issues that further development of GPT language models might cause. They are also unsure of how AI labs might go about “pausing” the development of future systems and what benefit that might bring.
The publication also noted that there is a common fallacy that greater version numbers equate to a greater and more powerful product. With the meteoric interest in ChatGPT and associated products between November 2022 and now, it might be easy to think that AI updates could take on a similar launch cycle to popular smartphones and mobile software rollouts. However, the prior GPT-3 language model was released in 2020 with GPT-3.5 as an incremental update in late 2022 before GPT-4 as its next major launch.
With GPT-4 being new by a matter of weeks, there is still a lot that OpenAI can do with the language model under its current branding.
“We are doing other things on top of GPT-4 that I think have all sorts of safety issues that are important to address and were totally left out of the letter,” Altman said.
Editors' Recommendations The world responds to the creator of ChatGPT being fired by his own company New ‘poisoning’ tool spells trouble for AI text-to-image tech ChatGPT: the latest news, controversies, and tips you need to know ChatGPT’s new upgrade finally breaks the text barrier Most people distrust AI and want regulation, says new survey Artificial Intelligence Tech News Computing Facebook owner Meta is working on an artificial intelligence (AI) system that it hopes will be more powerful than GPT-4, the large language model developed by OpenAI that powers ChatGPT Plus. If successful, that could add much more competition to the world of generative AI chatbots -- and potentially bring a host of serious problems along with it.
According to The Wall Street Journal, Meta is aiming to launch its new AI model in 2024. The company reportedly wants the new model to be “several times more powerful” than Llama 2, the AI tool it launched as recently as July 2023.
Computing People were in awe when ChatGPT came out, impressed by its natural language abilities as an AI chatbot. But when the highly anticipated GPT-4 large language model came out, it blew the lid off what we thought was possible with AI, with some calling it the early glimpses of AGI (artificial general intelligence).
The creator of the model, OpenAI, calls it the company's "most advanced system, producing safer and more useful responses." Here's everything you need to know about it, including how to use it and what it can do.
What is GPT-4? GPT-4 is a new language model created by OpenAI that can generate text that is similar to human speech. It advances the technology used by ChatGPT, which is currently based on GPT-3.5. GPT is the acronym for Generative Pre-trained Transformer, a deep learning technology that uses artificial neural networks to write like a human.
Computing The Zoom video-calling app has just added its own “AI Companion” assistant that integrates artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMs) from ChatGPT maker OpenAI and Facebook owner Meta. The tool is designed to help you catch up on meetings you missed and devise quick responses to chat messages.
Zoom’s developer says the AI Companion “empowers individuals by helping them be more productive, connect and collaborate with teammates, and improve their skills.” Upgrade your lifestyle Digital Trends helps readers keep tabs on the fast-paced world of tech with all the latest news, fun product reviews, insightful editorials, and one-of-a-kind sneak peeks.
