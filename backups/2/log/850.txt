Best Amazon Echo Black Friday deals Best Amazon Echo Show Black Friday deals Best Amazon Echo Black Friday deals The Amazon Echo devices helped make Alexa very popular, because Alexa smart speakers are the most convenient way of accessing the conveniences that the digital assistant is capable of providing. There are various models to choose from, with prices ranging from affordable to expensive, so it’s all a matter of figuring out the features that you would want from your Amazon Echo. The fourth-generation Amazon Echo , the latest version of the base model, remains one of the top choices, but we think the fifth-generation Amazon Echo Dot is the best Alexa-powered smart speaker. Feel free to look at all the Amazon Echo devices with discounts for Black Friday.
Amazon Echo Pop — Amazon Echo Dot (5th Gen) — Amazon Echo Dot Kids (5th Gen) — Amazon Echo (4th Gen, Refurbished) — Amazon Echo (4th Gen) — Amazon Echo Studio — Best Amazon Echo Show Black Friday deals The Amazon Echo Show devices take the Amazon Echo smart speakers and add screens to them, for another way of interacting with Alexa. You can use the smart displays to watch streaming shows, access other smart home devices, and make video calls, among lots of other helpful functions. The third-generation Amazon Echo Show 8 is one of our favorites because of its sharp and bright 8-inch HD touchscreen, excellent sound, and high-quality camera, but you simply can’t go wrong if you buy any model of the Amazon Echo Show. You can also communicate with your Echo through a tablet, so check out Amazon Fire Tablet Black Friday deals.

With Black Friday deals going on right now, this is your chance to upgrade to a great blender for a similarly excellent price. We've picked out the very best Vitamix blender deal below along with some other options you might want to consider buying.
Best Vitamix blender Black Friday deal Vitamix Explorian E310 blender -- $290, was $350 The Vitamix Explorian E310 blender is perfect for making a variety of different textures and liquids. It has 10 variable speeds plus a pulse setting so you can easily use it to prepare soup, make fresh salsa, or even knead dough. It has a powerful 2 HP motor for handling even the toughest of ingredients while its 48 ounce container is perfect for formulating medium-size batches of whatever you're cooking. It's easily cleaned in the dishwasher or you can add soap and warm water and the machine can clean itself in just 30 to 60 seconds.
Deals Vacuums are expensive. Feature-rich vacuums, especially wet-dry vacuums that can handle all spills, are even pricier. Recognizing that there’s a gap in the market for more affordable options, Eureka has delivered one for under $200. Get excited. They're perfect for cleaning sticky messes, whether you made them, your kids, or your pets. But the most important distinction is that wet and dry vacuums can vacuum and mop all in one go, and you don't have to swap out devices, attachments, or anything else. At least, that's the case with Eureka's excellent NEW400 wet and dry all-in-one vacuum. It's even self-propelled to make it easier on you -- and it takes less effort to glide around your floors.
Here's the best part of all, though. For Black Friday, running from November 17 to November 27, you can save big on the Eureka NEW400, which is discounted to $140 instead of its normal $200 price. That's a total savings of $60, but really, even more, considering you're not having to buy a separate vacuum and mop. You can grab that deal below right now or keep reading to learn a little more about what the NEW400 has to offer.
