That’s why The Sopranos , The Wire , and The Larry Sanders Show are still fondly remembered today. In the present, HBO is still the high watermark for comedy and drama, with shows like House of the Dragon , The White Lotus , and more keeping the brand alive and well. And although only a few shows are offering new episodes this month, there’s never a bad time to get up to date with the best HBO series streaming right now.
Not finding what you’re looking for on HBO? We regularly update our lists of the best shows on Netflix , the best shows on Amazon Prime Video , the best shows on Disney+ , and the best shows on Hulu as well.

The White Lotus (2021) new tv-ma 2 Seasons Comedy, Drama, Mystery Alexandra Daddario, Jake Lacy, Connie Britton, Steve Zahn, Jennifer Coolidge, Murray Bartlett, Sydney Sweeney, Brittany O'Grady Mike White watch on HBO watch on HBO The White Lotus is back for a second season, and the dead bodies are already piling up! This will surely not be good for the Yelp score. While the first season took place at a White Lotus resort in Maui, the second season moves the story to a hotel destination in Sicily. Valentina (Sabrina Impacciatore) is the unfortunate manager who has to deal with these fickle guests, including season 1 veterans Tanya McQuoid-Hunt (Jennifer Coolidge) and Greg Hunt (Jon Gries), a newly married couple. But there’s trouble in paradise and tension between Tanya and Greg when she drags her assistant, Portia (Haley Lu Richardson), along on their “romantic” getaway. Comedy, drama, and possibly murder will ensue.
