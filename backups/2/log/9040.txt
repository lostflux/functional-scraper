The trailer showcased the fast-paced, real-time combat that the series is known for in its action-packed footage. It also introduces a sword-slinging protagonist and his journey through Ubisoft’s latest version of its Persian setting.
We didn’t learn too much about The Lost Crown’s story in the trailer. However, based on the dialogue bits in the cutscenes, we know it focuses on a group of elite warriors and their mission to rescue the prince of the kingdom from cursed enemies who have somehow kidnapped him. Expect a mix of melee-based and magical fights, and plenty of parkour stunts like vaulting through sandstone plazas and lush forests.
The last Prince of Persia game, The Shadow and the Flame remake, released back in 2010. The series has been due for a reboot since. It just so happens that The Lost Crown isn’t Ubisoft’s only Prince of Persia project, either. It also previously announced a remake for the 2003 Prince of Persia game, The Sands of Time , though that project has suffered an indefinite delay as it’s reportedly been rebooted behind the scenes.
Ubisoft will reveal more about the game during its official showcase next week on Monday, June 12, after the Summer Game Fest kickoff. It’s unknown if The Sands of Time remake will also appear at that show.
Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown is scheduled to release on January 18, 2024, for PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5 , Xbox One, Xbox Series X /S, Nintendo Switch, and Amazon Luna.

Gaming November 19 marks the 25th anniversary of the original Half-Life, and to celebrate, Valve made a special announcement. No, Half-Life 3 was not announced. But Valve celebrated the anniversary with a massive update to the game on PC and a new documentary detailing its development. The best part: It's all available for free.
Half-Life's 25th-anniversary update incorporates the Half-Life: Uplink demo that Valve gave away as a CD via magazine and hardware manufacturer promotions in the 1990s and introduces many multiplayer maps. That includes four brand-new maps -- Contamination, Pool Party, Disposal, and Rocket Frenzy -- and three more maps that were previously only included in the Half-Life: Further Data CD release: Double Cross, Rust Mill, and Xen DM. It's also now possible to play as a Space Biker, Prototype Barney, Skeleton, and Too Much Coffee Man and use dozens of Further Data sprays in Half-Life: Deathmatch.
Gaming The original Hollow Knight was first released in 2017 and was immediately recognized as one of the most impressive entries in the Metroidvania genre, indie or not. The immaculate hand-drawn art style made even the dank, drab world full of bugs known as Hollownest a truly endearing place to explore. Combined with the tight platforming controls, light soulslike elements, satisfying upgrades, and cryptic story, Hollow Knight soared to the top of many critics' and players' favorite games lists.
Team Cherry, the three-person team behind Hollow Knight, didn't stop there. The team continued working on the game for the following year with four pieces of DLC that expanded the game's world and added new enemies, bosses, quests, and game modes. Initially planned as yet another piece of DLC, Hollow Knight: Silksong, originally called Hornet, became so large that Team Cherry decided to make it a full sequel. The development of this new entry has been as mysterious as the world it is set in, with many important questions still shrouded in darkness. As we continue to wait for our next dive into the world of bugs, here's everything we know about Hollow Knight: Silksong.
