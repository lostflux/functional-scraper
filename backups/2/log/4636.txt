But when such an event inevitably occurs, we like to know what happened. In detail. And preferably even if the event occurred at night. Moreover, it’s better to be prepared before an accident happens, which means the best time to grab a dashcam, preferably at a discount, is right now. Honestly, it really is the perfect time with Amazon’s Prime Day Big Deal Day sale going on in October. Since we’re talking about 4K dash cams, you should know the REDTIGER 4K Dual Dash Cam is a great choice. It’s on sale right now as part of Prime Day deals.

The REDTIGER 4K Dual Dash Cam has a 4K cam up front and a 1080p rear cam, with 170 and 140-degree viewing angles, respectively. It uses a Starvis Sensor to pick up details in nighttime and low-light environments. And the REDTIGER 4K Dual Dash Cam uses a 24-hour parking monitor system that records footage 15 seconds at a time when it detects motion throughout the night while recording a time-lapse of your vehicle’s surroundings. It stores to a 256Gb drive, with an allowance of approximately 16 hours of total footage.
Another feature the REDTIGER 4K Dual Dash Cam has is that not all of the best dash cams offer quality GPS support. It’ll help you locate where you are, track your route, and show your speeds. “No, Officer, I was not the one speeding!” It’s just another layer of due diligence in your car accident planning.

Editors' Recommendations The best October Prime Day electric scooter deals happening now Weekend deal: Save $50 on this popular 4K dash cam at Best Buy Deals Amazon Amazon Prime Day Cars Lucid Motors has become the latest automaker to announce that it will adopt the North American Charging Standard (NACS) – also known as "the Tesla plug" – for its electric vehicles.
The move follows in the footsteps of more than a dozen other automakers that have also adopted Tesla’s charging connector, among them General Motors, Ford, Toyota, BMW, Jaguar Land Rover, Volvo, and Honda.
Cars General Motors-owned Cruise has halted production of its fully driverless vehicle -- the Origin -- just over a week after it suspended robotaxi operations nationwide following a number of troubling incidents involving its cars.
The news was announced by Cruise CEO Kyle Vogt during a meeting with staff on Monday, according to Forbes, which obtained audio of the gathering.
Cars The Ram brand is finally taking an electrified approach, and by resurrecting the Ramcharger name, no less. Alongside the new 2025 Ram 1500, the company has unveiled the new 2025 Ram 1500 Ramcharger, a new plug-in hybrid that Ram touts as offering "unlimited battery electric range." The new truck is one of a number of electrified trucks, the most well-known of which include the fully-electric Ford F-150 Lightning and the new Chevrolet Silverado EV. But instead of being fully electric, the 1500 Ramcharger is a plug-in hybrid, meaning that it has an electric motor and battery, and a gas tank and engine.
The plug-in approach It's perhaps a smart move. Electric trucks show a lot of promise -- but they start to falter a little when it comes to things like towing and hauling heavy loads. Keeping the 1500 Ramcharger a hybrid means that with no load or light ones, the truck can zip around town on electric power -- and when necessary, it can switch the engine on to tow or haul. It could well be the perfect combo for many truck owners who at least occasionally need that extra oomph, but who still could stand to save some cash -- and go a little easier on the environment - when simply driving around town.
