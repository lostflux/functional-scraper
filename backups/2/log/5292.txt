It suggests that the frequent scandals surrounding AI-created malware and disinformation are taking their toll and that the public might be increasingly receptive to ideas of AI regulation.
The survey from the MITRE Corporation and the Harris Poll claims that just 39% of 2,063 U.S. adults polled believe that today’s AI tech is “safe and secure,” a drop of 9% from when the two firms conducted their last survey in November 2022.
Sanket Mishra / Pexels When it came to specific concerns, 82% of people were worried about deepfakes and “other artificial engineered content,” while 80% feared how this technology might be used in malware attacks. A majority of respondents worried about AI’s use in identity theft, harvesting personal data, replacing humans in the workplace , and more.
In fact, the survey indicates that people are becoming more wary of AI’s impact across various demographic groups. While 90% of boomers are worried about the impact of deepfakes, 72% of Gen Z members are also anxious about the same topic.
GPT-4 Turbo is the biggest update since ChatGPT’s launch Qualcomm says its new chips are 4.5 times faster at AI than rivals OpenAI’s new tool can spot fake AI images, but there’s a catch Although younger people are less suspicious of AI — and are more likely to use it in their everyday lives — concerns remain high in a number of areas, including whether the industry should do more to protect the public and whether AI should be regulated.
Strong support for regulation Shutterstock The declining support for AI tools has likely been prompted by months of negative stories in the news concerning generative AI tools and the controversies facing ChatGPT , Bing Chat, and other products. As tales of misinformation, data breaches, and malware mount, it seems that the public is becoming less amenable to the looming AI future.
When asked in the MITRE-Harris poll whether the government should step in to regulate AI, 85% of respondents were in favor of the idea — up 3% from last time. The same 85% agreed with the statement that “Making AI safe and secure for public use needs to be a nationwide effort across industry, government, and academia,” while 72% felt that “The federal government should focus more time and funding on AI security research and development.” The widespread anxiety over AI being used to improve malware attacks is interesting. We recently spoke to a group of cybersecurity experts on this very topic, and the consensus seemed to be that while AI could be used in malware, it is not a particularly strong tool at the moment. Some experts felt that its ability to write effective malware code was poor, while others explained that hackers were likely to find better exploits in public repositories than by asking AI for help.
Still, the increasing skepticism for all things AI could end up shaping the industry’s efforts and might prompt companies like OpenAI to invest more money in safeguarding the public from the products they release. And with such overwhelming support, don’t be surprised if governments start enacting AI regulation sooner rather than later.
Editors' Recommendations The world responds to the creator of ChatGPT being fired by his own company New ‘poisoning’ tool spells trouble for AI text-to-image tech Apple may finally beef up Siri with AI smarts next year Bing Chat just beat a security check to stop hackers and spammers Bing Chat’s ads are sending users to dangerous malware sites Artificial Intelligence Tech News Computing ChatGPT has continued to dazzle the internet with AI-generated content, morphing from a novel chatbot into a piece of technology that is driving the next era of innovation. No tech product in recent memory has sparked as much interest, controversy, fear, and excitement.
If you're just now catching on, it'd be fair to wonder what the fuss is all about. You can try it out for yourself for free (or use the official free iOS app), but here's the detailed guide you've been looking for -- whether you're worried about an AI apocalypse or are just looking for an intro guide to the app.
Computing ChatGPT has just regained the ability to browse the internet to help you find information. That should (hopefully) help you get more accurate, up-to-date data right when you need it, rather than solely relying on the artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot’s rather outdated training data.
As well as giving straight-up answers to your questions based on info found online, ChatGPT developer OpenAI revealed that the tool will provide a link to its sources so you can check the facts yourself. If it turns out that ChatGPT was wrong or misleading, well, that’s just another one for the chatbot’s long list of missteps.
Computing OpenAI is rolling out new functionalities for ChatGPT that will allow prompts to be executed with images and voice directives in addition to text.
The AI brand announced on Monday that it will be making these new features available over the next two weeks to ChatGPT Plus and Enterprise users. The voice feature is available in iOS and Android in an opt-in capacity, while the images feature is available on all ChatGPT platforms. OpenAI notes it plans to expand the availability of the images and voice features beyond paid users after the staggered rollout.
