But another company in the movie-streaming space, Vudu, has just launched a neat feature that lets you ditch the film and switch to something else without having to pay again.
Called Rental Redo, the option lets you abandon a movie within the first half an hour — plenty of time to confirm that what you’re watching deserves not one additional minute of your precious time.
The best movies on Amazon Prime Video (November 2023) You probably didn’t watch the most underrated crime thriller of the 2010s. Here’s why you should see it now 3 TV shows on Tubi you should watch in November “Rent without worry because Rental Redo is just like having a gift receipt for your movie,” Vudu said in a blog post announcing the new feature. “If you decide your rental is not for you within the first 30 minutes, we’ll give you a ‘redo’ so you can find another movie to fit your mood.” To obtain your credit, you’ll need to call or email Vudu’s customer care team within 24 hours of hitting the stop button on the movie. The credit should land in your account within 24 hours of making contact, though it won’t be given if you downloaded the movie to a device. Also, a Rental Redo can only be performed one time per movie.
Rental Redo lets you ditch up to four rented movies per month, though if you find yourself regularly hitting that limit, either your method of selecting movies requires an overhaul or you have unreasonably high expectations when it comes to cinema.
The new feature from California-based Vudu seems like a great idea and could help the company persuade more movie fans to use its service over competitors such as those mentioned at the top.
As an additional incentive to use its streaming platform, Vudu has also launched a price promise feature, so if you find a movie from a competing service with a cheaper rental fee, it will add a credit for the price difference to your account.
Vudu’s movie library can be a useful place to explore when your subscription services — if you’re signed up to any — fail to deliver the goods. Rental Redo and the new price promise make it even more appealing.
Editors' Recommendations 5 bad 2000s action movies that you still need to watch right now 5 best death game movies you should watch right now 3 dramas on Prime Video you need to watch in November 6 best TV shows you need to watch in December 3 sci-fi movies on Paramount+ you need to watch in November News Tech News Entertainment Who's in the mood for an action film? Netflix has an impressive slate of action films that only improves with the addition of new films every month. New arrivals include Liam Neeson's Cold Pursuit, David Fincher's The Killer, and Adam Wingard's Godzilla vs. Kong.
This November, we curated a list of three action movies you need to watch on Netflix. Our action picks include one of the best war movies ever made, an underrated Clint Eastwood thriller, and Michael Bay at his finest.
Saving Private Ryan (1998) Entertainment Generally, we tend to give streamers the benefit of the doubt when it comes to their film libraries. But there's no getting around the fact that the science fiction selection on Peacock is awful. For every Back to the Future, there are dozens of low-budget schlock-fests like Atlantic Rim, Lord of the Elves, and Dino King. Those are all real movies on Peacock, but they aren't worth your time. And unfortunately, there's nothing new on Peacock in November in the popular genre.
With such a thin selection to work with, it can be truly challenging to find sci-fi flicks on Peacock that are worth watching. But after an exhaustive search, we've come up with the following three sci-fi movies on Peacock that you need to watch in November.
Freejack (1992) Entertainment Sci-fi films never go out of style. From Alien and Back to the Future to Dune and Blade Runner, sci-fi films continue to improve thanks to new technology. Many sci-fi films find a home on Netflix and wind up on the streamer's 10 most popular movies list. Films like Don't Look Up, The Adam Project, and Bird Box are 10 of the most popular English films on Netflix ever.
The Adam Project is one of our picks for sci-fi movies to watch in November. Other selections include the epic sequel to Godzilla: King of the Monsters, and a sci-fi thriller about a pilot's fight for survival against the dinosaurs.
Godzilla vs. Kong (2021) Upgrade your lifestyle Digital Trends helps readers keep tabs on the fast-paced world of tech with all the latest news, fun product reviews, insightful editorials, and one-of-a-kind sneak peeks.
