Many of us don’t lock up our custom-built PCs in anonymous black boxes anymore. Clear side panel cases make your graphics card the star, and the ZOTAC GAMING GeForce RTX 3090 AMP Extreme Holo was made with that in mind. Its eye-catching HoloBlack design and RGB lighting make a real impression.
These features have really paid off. The ZOTAC GAMING GeForce RTX 3090 AMP Extreme Holo was a Red Dot Design winner this year, representing the best in design and technological innovation.
Performance matters too. ZOTAC’s GAMING GeForce RTX 3090 AMP Extreme Holo is clocked higher than the competition, generating greater power.
You’ll appreciate that power if you want to add camera RAW processing or lens blur to a 50MP image in Photoshop. Or perform 3D modeling using Blender or Octane Render. A ZOTAC GAMING GeForce RTX 3090 AMP Extreme Holo lets you move your creations around in real time without waiting as your computer re-renders and de-noises the preview. Full scene renders take seconds, rather than minutes.
A ZOTAC GAMING GeForce RTX 3090 AMP Extreme Holo smooths out your workflow. You’ll like your computer a whole lot more as a result.
Image used with permission by copyright holder Gaming We can’t ignore gamers. You want a card like the ZOTAC GAMING GeForce RTX 3090 AMP Extreme Holo to play Cyberpunk 2077 at 4K resolution with Ray Tracing turned on. Not to mention, its enhanced clock speed guarantees you higher frame rates than other RTX 3090 cards.
This kind of power generates heat, and ZOTAC has enhanced its IceStorm 2.0 cooling system for the card to suit. Three 11-blade 100mm diameter fans offer up to 10% higher airflow than ZOTAC’s last generation models.
They won’t remind you of their presence when you’re not playing either. The ZOTAC FREEZE Fan Stop halts all three while the GPU is idle, which also increases longevity.
Image used with permission by copyright holder HoloBlack design Creating a card you’ll be proud to own involves much more than just performance and efficiency. Design is key, so if it’s armored with front and back metal plates and uses ZOTAC’s HoloBlack design, pride of ownership prevails.
This makes the exterior of the ZOTAC GAMING GeForce RTX 3090 AMP Extreme Holo a statement piece. A translucent layer provides an iridescent splash of color in the green and purple shades of an aurora.
The ZOTAC GAMING GeForce RTX 3090 AMP Extreme Holo’s RGB LEDs paint in exacting and elegant lines and shapes across the body. They are controlled by ZOTAC’s SPECTRA 2.0 system, which allows for dynamic and customizable lighting profiles. You can choose to cycle through colors, make them dance to music or “breathe” in and out, and more.
By using addressable RGB lighting, the ZOTAC GAMING GeForce RTX 3090 AMP Extreme Holo offers far greater control over the behavior of each LED zone. It’s a symphony of color and light at your fingertips.
A 3-pin RGB header also lets you attach a light strip to sync with the ZOTAC GAMING GeForce RTX 3090 AMP Extreme Holo’s own LEDs, to mesmerizing effect. Easily, you can achieve the visual impact many of the top YouTubers and content creators want.
Whether you play games, create videos, work in 3D modeling, or all three, a ZOTAC GAMING GeForce RTX 3090 AMP Extreme Holo makes your custom PC a source of true power and visual punch.
