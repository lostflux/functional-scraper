But these ostensibly straightforward power and data conduits come in many shapes and sizes. Even cables that appear identical may perform differently when you plug them into your phone or laptop. Various connectors, specifications, charging rates, and data transfer speeds make for a confusing, messy scene.
Don't worry. We dived into the dreaded box of cables, identified the ones you need for different scenarios, and untangled them, ready for use. You'll find some advice here on USB-C, Lightning, and MicroUSB connectors, as well as a primer on everything you need to know about cables. After all, we're WIRED.
Updated August 2023: We added cables from Baseus, Lindy, and Anker, and updated prices throughout.

Photograph: Alex Livinsky/Getty Images Cable Advice Tips and Tricks Cables are usually included in the box for whatever device you purchase. These are generally capable of charging the device at the maximum rate. Keep it safe, keep it simple, and if it is unmarked, consider labeling it.
Check your device's standards.
 Look for a cable that matches your needs. For example, if your device supports Power Delivery, then get a PD cable. Remember: The charging adapter also must support the same standards. We have more details about standards at the bottom of this guide.
You can use USB-C for displays.
 Manufacturers will state the data transfer speed or list support for 4K or 8K video on select cables. That means you can just use a USB-C to USB-C cable to transmit video from your laptop to your monitor. You should consider DisplayPort Alt Mode (DP Alt Mode) support, as this enables you to hook up displays and video sources that support DisplayPort.
It is safe to use your phone while it is charging , but it will charge at a slower rate. Heat is also bad for battery health, so it is best to take a break when your phone feels warm.
Poorly made cables can overheat and start fires.
 To boost your chances of buying a dependable cable, look for USB-IF certification or stick to trustworthy brands like Anker, Cable Matters, or Syncwire.
Photograph: Cable Matters Best Overall USB-C to USB-C Cable Cable Matters USB-C to USB-C Thunderbolt 4 There is something to be said for the simplicity of getting the most capable USB-C cable you possibly can, and right now, an Intel-certified Thunderbolt 4 cable like this one will meet all your needs. It carries 100 watts, enough to charge a laptop, and it can transfer data at up to 40 Gbps. It’s also capable of serving an 8K display (or two 4K displays). It supports both DisplayPort Alt Mode (DP Alt Mode) and USB Power Delivery (USB-PD), including PPS, which enables fast charging for certain Samsung devices, and it is backward-compatible with all earlier standards.
The two shorter-length cables are passive, and the 6.6-foot cable is active. (Active cables have an extra chip inside to help them push data further without degradation.) I’ve been testing the two shorter cables and have yet to find anything they can’t do. The cables come with a one-year limited warranty in the US (lifetime limited warranty in the UK and a two-year limited warranty in the EU).
Length: 2.6, 3.3, or 6.6 feet. Supports 100 watts, 40 Gbps.

It is rated to carry 100 watts, meaning it can be used to power the beefiest MacBook Pro , and it can transmit data at up to 10 gigabits per second (Gbps). It's USB-IF certified, which means it has been tested to ensure it complies with standards set by the USB Implementers Forum, and it boasts a lifetime warranty. The downside? It's only 3 feet long.
Length: 3 feet. Supports 100 watts, 10 Gbps.
$20 at Amazon $20 at Walmart $18 at Anker Photograph: Monoprice Best Budget USB-C to USB-C Cable Monoprice USB-C to USB-C Select Series 3.1 Gen 2 You can save a few dollars by going with this USB-C to USB-C cable, and you don’t have to sacrifice, because it is capable of 100-W charging and 10-Gbps data transfer. You can even use this cable to connect a laptop to a 4K display. So, what’s the catch? Well, it is very short, finished in plain black plastic, quite thick with relatively long connectors, and not very flexible. But these specs at this price make it a total bargain. It is also USB-IF certified and comes with a lifetime warranty.
Length: 1.64 or 3.28 feet. Supports 100 watts, 10 Gbps.

They boast an eco-friendly build with a flexible knit fabric finish crafted from certified recycled plastic and aluminum that looks (and feels) lovely and promises to last. WIRED reviews editor Julian Chokkattu has been using a few of these for years with zero issues. Available in three lengths with a two-year warranty, they charge at a rate that should be good enough for most portable devices, but they're slow for data transfer.
Length: 3.3, 6.6, or 9.9 feet. Supports 60 watts, 480 Mbps.
$22 at Nimble Photograph: Caudabe Best USB-C to Lightning Cable Caudabe ChargeFlex Apple's cables are notoriously bad. The casing around the wires easily falls apart over a short period of time, so it's smart to invest in a durable USB-C to Lightning cable. This thick braided cable only comes in black and is reinforced with Kevlar for durability. There is a leather clip you can use for cable management, and the ridged finish on the connectors makes them easy to grip when unplugging. There are USB-C to Lightning and USB-C to USB-C versions , and both are Made for iPhone-certified (MFi), so they'll work perfectly with your iPhone or iPad. Caudabe offers a one-year warranty.
Length: 5 feet. Supports 100 watts, 480 Mbps.
★ Another alternative : The Ugreen USB-C to Lightning Cable ($15) offers similar performance in a durable package with braided nylon and metal covers. It is MFi certified and comes in 3-, 6-, or 10-foot varieties.

These Are Our Favorite Games Eric Ravenscraft Gear The Top New Features in Apple’s iOS 17 and iPadOS 17 Julian Chokkattu Photograph: UGreen Best USB-A to USB-C Cable UGreen USB-C to USB-A Cable 3.0 Some devices with USB-C ports (certain camera accessories, portable battery packs, and other cheap gadgets) can only charge using a USB-A to USB-C cable instead of a USB-C to USB-C. Usually, this is because USB-C charging ports use the Power Delivery protocol and need to be told the required voltage by the device charging, which means it needs a controller chip. This USB-IF certified, braided nylon cable should do the trick and offers reasonably speedy charging and data transfer to boot.
Length: 3 or 6 feet. Supports 18 watts, 5 Gbps.
★ Alternative pick : The Cable Matters Gen 2 USB-A to USB-C cable ($10) is a good alternative if you want faster data transfer speeds (it maxes out at 10 Gbps), but it is limited to 15 watts for charging.
$11 at Amazon Photograph: Amazon Best USB-C to MicroUSB Cable Amazon Basics USB-C to MicroUSB This cable is perfect for any older devices with MicroUSB ports, like older Kindles.
 It comes in various lengths and colors and has a durable-feeling braided nylon finish. It is USB-IF certified. The 1-foot option is handy if you are charging a device from a laptop and want to keep your desktop relatively uncluttered.
Length: 1, 3, or 10 feet.

The charging cable then attaches magnetically to this tip. The beauty is that kids won't need to precisely insert a cable into the port, and it reduces the danger of breaking the port or plug when they pull the cable out or trip over it.
It's also a nice way for any MacBook owners to get the MagSafe-style charger from the old days, especially if you don't want to upgrade to the new MacBooks that brought it back. The only problem? The tips can go missing, so be careful.
Length: 3.3 feet. Supports 100 watts, 480 Mbps.
$35 at Amazon $23 at OneAdaptr Photograph: Amazon Most Durable USB-C Cable Fuse Chicken Armour Charge Some pets like to chew charging cables, and some people just seem to wear through cables faster than others. If you've been looking for a more durable option, this Fuse Chicken cable should do the trick. The cable combines aluminum sleeves with several layers of cable protection, including Kevlar and stainless steel chainmail. They are not as flexible as other cables and are relatively heavy and pricey. But Fuse Chicken does offer a lifetime warranty. I encouraged my cat to attack one of these cables (when it wasn't plugged in!), but it still works and is unscathed.
Length: 6.6 feet. Supports 100 watts, 480 Mbps ★ Another alternative : The RUGD Rhino Power USB-C to USB-C (£20) is a solid option for folks in the UK. It has a braided nylon finish and can withstand a minimum of 100 kilograms of tension and 100,000 bends. It can also deliver up to 60 watts.

This braided nylon cable from Anker is a durable option with a lifetime warranty. It is 10 feet long and can go up to 100 watts, which is enough to fast-charge practically any laptop, phone, or tablet, and it comes with a handy cable tie. You can get it in black or white, but I like the red, as it is easy to spot and less of a tripping hazard.

It is technically USB-A to MicroUSB, but there's an adapter at the tip that converts it to USB-C or Lightning. It has a durable fabric finish in a choice of four colors and can charge most of your gadgets at top speed. WIRED review editor Julian Chokkattu has used it to juice up a range of devices, from wireless keyboards to a Fire tablet. It's also MFi certified for Apple devices.
Length: 6 feet. Supports 100 watts, 480 Mbps.

It sports a tiny blue LED display that's built into one of the ends, and when you plug it in, the charging rate pops up in watts. When I measured it against my digital USB tester, it appeared accurate, though it rounds up to the nearest whole watt. It maxes out at 100 watts, so it can fast-charge most gadgets but is not a good pick for data transfer. The braided nylon finish and metal ends feel durable.
Length: 3.3 or 6.6 feet. Supports 100 watts, 480 Mbps.
$17 at Amazon Photograph: Cable Matters Best USB-C to HDMI Cable Matters USB C to HDMI 2.1 Adapter If you’re looking for a way to plug your USB-C device into a monitor or TV, this adapter can help. The USB-C to HDMI cables and adapters scene is a minefield for compatibility, so do your research first to ensure you get something that works. Provided your desktop, laptop, tablet, or phone supports DP (DisplayPort) Alt Mode, you can use this adapter to switch to HDMI 2.1 (you will still need an HDMI cable). It’s a durable aluminum adapter with a braided cable, and it supports 8K at 30Hz or 4K at 120Hz. It can also handle 4K at 144Hz if the USB-C source is DP 1.4 and the monitor is HDMI 2.1, but it is limited to 4K at 60Hz for Macs. The adapter supports HDR and is lag-free, making it a solid choice for hooking up to the latest gaming monitors, though sadly, it does not support VRR, FreeSync, or G-Sync. We recommend you check compatibility before you buy.

It tops our Best USB Hubs and Docks guide because it plugs in via the attached USB-C cable to give you two USB-A 3.0 ports, an HDMI output, and a full-size and MicroSD card reader. Using HDMI, you can get 4K video output at 30 Hz or 1080p at 60 Hz.
$35 at Amazon Photograph: Syncwire Best Cable Tidy Syncwire Mini Cable Clip Holders Keeping cables neat and orderly, ready to grab and plug in when you need them, requires a little help. I’ve tested various cable management options, and these simple clips from Syncwire are my favorites. You get five stick-on strips in the pack with between one and five slots for holding cable ends neatly in place. They stay put, hold your cables securely, and are fairly unobtrusive.
★ Alternative pick : I use the Smartish Cable Wrangler ($30) on my desktop to stop cable ends from disappearing off the back of my desk. It works great with metal connectors, but for some cables, you must attach a special cable collar that sticks magnetically (you get three in the box).

These Are Our Favorite Games Eric Ravenscraft Gear The Top New Features in Apple’s iOS 17 and iPadOS 17 Julian Chokkattu Photograph: Monoprice Honorable Mentions Other Good USB-C Cables There are so many cables out there, and plenty of solid options did not make the cut. Here are a few I’ve tested and liked.
Anker Powerline III for $12 : This cable is slim, but durable, with textured USB-C heads that make it easy to grip when removing. While it can go up to 100 watts for charging, it is—somewhat confusingly—not as good as the Powerline II we list above for data transfer because it maxes out at 480 Mbps.
Baseus 2-in-1 USB-C Cable for $20 : We like the idea of a single USB-C at one end and two at the other, allowing you to charge two devices at up to 100 watts from a single cable. Sadly, the splitter section is bulky, some devices we plugged in were slow to charge, and data transfer maxes out at 480 Mbps. The linked cable is 4.9 feet long, but you can get 3.3-feet and 10-feet lengths.
Lindy USB 3.2 Type C to C Cable for $28 : These active cables are suitable for hooking monitors up to your computer, and they support up to 8K at 60 Hz and 4K at 120 Hz. They also support DisplayPort 1.4. I tested the longer 3- and 5-meter variants that max out at 60 watts for Power Delivery and 10 Gbps for data (but they’re out of stock). The shorter cable linked here can go up to 20 Gbps. They work well and feel durable, but they’re a bit pricey.
Monoprice AtlasFlex Series USB 3.2 Gen 2 for $10 : This USB-C to USB-C cable supports 100-watt charging and data transfer at up to 10 Gbps and has worked flawlessly in my testing. The AtlasFlex series comes in a range of bright colors that make it easy to pick out of the tangle (purple is best), and they are nylon braided and reinforced with Kevlar.
Satechi USB-C to USB-C Charging Cable for $20 : Gear from Satechi always has a classy look, and its braided nylon cables are no exception. This one is 6.5 feet, has a Velcro strap, and is capable of 100-watt charging, with support for PD and QC. Sadly, data transfer is limited to 480 Mbps. I also tested Satechi’s equally good-looking 6-foot USB-C to Lightning Charging Cable ($25).
Plugable Thunderbolt 4 Transfer Cable for $60 : This active Thunderbolt 4 USB-C to USB-C cable matches our top pick with support for 100-watt charging and data transfers up to 40 Gbps. It is 6.6 feet long and comes with a two-year warranty.
Aohi Magline+ at $11 : With a braided nylon finish and metal connectors, this USB-C to USB-C charging cable feels built to last. It carries up to 100 watts, but data transfer is limited to 480 Mbps. It’s 6 feet long and quite thick, so it doesn’t tangle too much. I also tried the MFi-certified USB-C to Lightning cable , which maxes out at 30 watts.
Cable Matters USB-C to USB-C Charging Cable for $13 : Finished in white PVC, this 6.6-foot, USB-IF certified cable supports Power Delivery to carry up to 100 watts, meaning it can charge all your portable devices. I've used it for years , and it is still going strong. Cable Matters also offers a one-year warranty.
Belkin Boost Charge USB-C for $7 : This cable maxes out at 12 watts and 480 Mbps. The basic PVC finish is the cheapest, but you can opt for braided nylon too; both come in black or white at 3.3 or 6.6 feet. These cables are USB-IF certified and work as advertised (I've been using one in the car for the last few months).
Anker Powerline II (Gen 1) for $10 : I have used this 6-foot cable for many years without issues, but it tops out at 60 watts for charging and 480 Mbps for data transfer, and you can get more capable cables for less.
TwelveSouth Surface Snap for $23 : Another cable management solution, these leather loops have a stud closure, and you get three in a pack (one with a pair of loops and two with a single loop). They look nice, but one of mine came unstuck, and if you try to secure multiple cables with a single loop it can prove tricky to unleash one without all of them coming loose.
Photograph: Drew Mauck/Getty Images What You Need to Know Cables Explained With various standards and charging technologies at work, it is much harder than it should be to work out what a cable can do. There are a few things worth knowing when shopping.
USB Standards: The Universal Serial Bus (USB) standard dates to 1996 but has seen many new standards, revisions, and connector types in the years since. Instead of running through all of them here, we try to highlight what matters.
Connectors: While USB-C is mercifully becoming a standard connection type, you want cables with connectors that fit your existing devices. Today, that still might mean USB-A, Lightning, or even MicroUSB. Remember that the capabilities of any cable are limited to its oldest connection type.
Data: The data transfer speed is always in megabits per second (Mbps) or gigabits per second (Gbps). You'll know the speed a cable should be capable of by the standard: USB 2.0 supports 480 Mbps USB 3.0 supports 5 Gbps USB 3.1 supports 10 Gbps USB 3.2 Gen 1 supports 5 Gbps USB 3.2 Gen 2 supports 10 Gbps USB 3.2 Gen 3 supports 20 Gbps USB 4.0 supports 40 Gbps Power: While cable manufacturers always list the maximum charging rate, your device will determine how much power to draw, so it's important to know what standards it supports and combine your cable with the correct power adapter. The charging rate of a cable is measured in Watts (W). Sometimes manufacturers will list specifications on the cable in tiny print. If there’s no W listed, you can calculate it by multiplying the voltage (V) and the current (A), assuming they are listed.
Basic USB-C cables are passive and can only carry up to 60W. Cables that can carry 100W or more, sometimes described as active, must contain e-marker chips that identify the cable and its capabilities.
The Power Delivery (PD) standard is as close as we have to a common standard. A few manufacturers, like OnePlus, Oppo, and Xiaomi, still have proprietary charging standards. Then there's Qualcomm’s Quick Charge (QC) standard, which was the most popular for phones for many years, although Quick Charge 4+ supports PD. Even PD has a variant called Programmable Power Supply (PPS), which is part of the USB PD 3.0 standard. PPS allows for real-time adjustments to maximize efficiency and charge phones like Samsung's Galaxy S22 range at up to 45W instead of the usual 18W. The latest addition to PD is Extended Power Range (EPR), which allows USB-C cables to carry up to 240 watts (they used to be limited to 100W).
Thunderbolt was a proprietary interface developed by Intel and Apple, but it's now open for royalty-free use (still certified by Intel). With Thunderbolt 3, the standard adopted the USB-C connector and is capable of data transfer speeds up to 40 Gbps and can deliver 100 watts of power using the PD standard. Thunderbolt 4 brings various improvements mostly related to the video signal (support for two 4K displays or an 8K display). It also supports the USB 4 standard and is backward compatible with previous standards.
Cable Certification: There are a few different types of cable certification. When a cable is certified, that usually means it was independently tested and conforms to specific standards. It gives you, as a buyer, peace of mind that your cable performs as the manufacturer claims. Certification can be expensive, so many cable manufacturers shun it, but that doesn’t necessarily mean their cables are poor quality. The USB Implementers Forum (USB-IF) is a non-profit organization dedicated to advancing USB technology. Run by members like Apple, Google, HP, Microsoft, and Intel, it sets specifications and offers certification. If a cable is certified by the USB-IF, it has been tested to ensure it complies with its standards. Apple has its own Made for iPhone (MFi) certification for Lightning cables. Intel certifies Thunderbolt cables. Certified cables usually have the relevant logo on the connector (for example, Thunderbolt cables have a lightning bolt).
