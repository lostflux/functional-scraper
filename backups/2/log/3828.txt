After Elon Musk bought the company and laid off 7,500 full time employees, disinformation researchers and activists say, the team that took down toxic and fake content vanished. Now, after years of developing relationships within those teams, researchers say no one is responding to their reports of disinformation on the site, even as data suggests Twitter is becoming more toxic.
The issue is particularly acute in Brazil, where a runoff presidential election between right-wing incumbent Jair Bolsonaro and Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva took place just days after Musk‚Äôs takeover. Observers and activists had warned for months that Bolsonaro‚Äôs supporters might not accept the results of the election should he lose, and could resort to violence. When Bolsonaro supporters began questioning the election results online, researchers found that Twitter had apparently fired all the people who should be monitoring the platform.
‚ÄúAt this moment, we have nobody to reach out to,‚Äù says Nina Santos, a researcher at the Brazilian National Institute of Science & Technology in Digital Democracy. ‚ÄúAll the people that we were talking with are no longer there.‚Äù Santos says that until Musk‚Äôs takeover, Twitter had been ‚Äúquite responsive‚Äù in taking down rule-breaking content that could undermine trust in the election or spread disinformation, compared to Meta and Google. The entirety of Twitter‚Äôs Brazil team was included in the 7,500 people laid off earlier this month.
Although Lula was declared the winner of the election, Santos says she still sees tweets questioning the result or calling for mobilization against the government. All of these, she says, are dangerous. Twitter‚Äôs current policy states that the company will ‚Äúlabel or remove false or misleading information intended to undermine public confidence in an election or other civic process.‚Äù Christopher Bouzy, founder and CEO of Bot Sentinel, a project to fight disinformation and harassment on Twitter, was also monitoring the Brazilian elections, as well as the US midterms. Like Santos, he noticed that tweets claiming the Brazilian election was stolen remained up on Twitter.
Disinformation also flooded Twitter during the US midterms, particularly around the race in Maricopa County , Arizona, the state‚Äôs largest county and a consistent target of right-wing election deniers. Bouzy, who was monitoring thousands of right-wing accounts, says he had ‚Äúno idea who to contact‚Äù at the company to get tweets containing disinformation taken down. ‚ÄúTwitter is a shit show,‚Äù he says.
On November 15 , more than 70 civil society organizations across the globe wrote to Musk demanding he take action to stop hate speech becoming more prevalent on Twitter. In the weeks leading up to the US midterms, the nonprofit advocacy group Free Press released a report highlighting how all social platforms were allowing election disinformation to persist. Nora Benavidez, the group‚Äôs senior counsel and director of digital justice and civil rights, says that although many platforms, including Twitter, are not always responsive to researchers and activist organizations, mass layoffs have made this even more difficult.

Jesse Littlewood, vice president of campaigns at the nonprofit Common Cause, says he‚Äôs noticed that when his organization reports tweets that clearly violate Twitter‚Äôs policies, those posts are now less likely to get taken down.
The volume of content that users and watchdogs may want to report to Twitter is likely to increase. Many of the staff and contractors laid off in recent weeks worked on teams like trust and safety, policy, and civic integrity, all of which worked to keep disinformation and hate speech off the platform.
Melissa Ingle was a senior data scientist on Twitter‚Äôs civic integrity team until she was fired along with 4,400 other contractors on November 12. She wrote and monitored algorithms used to detect and remove political misinformation on Twitter‚Äîmost recently, that meant the elections in the US and Brazil. Of the 30 people on her team, only 10 remain, and many of the human content moderators, who review tweets and flag those that violate Twitter‚Äôs policies, have also been laid off. ‚ÄúMachine learning needs constant input, constant care,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúWe have to constantly update what we are looking for because political discourse changes all the time.‚Äù Though Ingle‚Äôs job did not involve interacting with outside activists or researchers, she says members of Twitter‚Äôs policy team did. At times, information from external groups helped inform the terms or content Ingle and her team would train algorithms to identify. She now worries that with so many staffers and contractors laid off, there won‚Äôt be enough people to ensure the software remains accurate.
‚ÄúWith the algorithm not being updated anymore and the human moderators gone, there‚Äôs just not enough people to manage the ship,‚Äù Ingle says. ‚ÄúMy concern is that these filters are going to get more and more porous, and more and more things are going to come through as the algorithms get less accurate over time. And there‚Äôs no human being to catch things going through the cracks.‚Äù Within a day of Musk taking ownership of Twitter, Ingle says, internal data showed that the number of abusive tweets reported by users increased 50 percent. That initial spike died off a little, she says, but abusive content reports remained about 40 percent or so higher than the usual volume before the takeover.
Rebekah Tromble, director of the Institute for Data, Democracy & Politics at George Washington University, also expects to see Twitter‚Äôs defenses against banned content wither. ‚ÄúTwitter has always struggled with this, but a number of talented teams had made real progress on these problems in recent months. Those teams have now been wiped out.‚Äù Such concerns are echoed by a former content moderator who was a contractor for Twitter until 2020. The contractor, speaking anonymously to avoid repercussions from his current employer, says all the former colleagues doing similar work whom he was in touch with have been fired. He expects the platform to become a much less nice place to be. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll be horrible,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI have actively searched the worst parts of Twitter‚Äîthe most racist, most horrible, most degenerate parts of the platform. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs going to be amplified.‚Äù You Might Also Like ‚Ä¶ üì® Make the most of chatbots with our AI Unlocked newsletter Taylor Swift, Star Wars, Stranger Things , and Deadpool have one man in common Generative AI is playing a surprising role in Israel-Hamas disinformation The new era of social media looks as bad for privacy as the last one Johnny Cash‚Äôs Taylor Swift cover predicts the boring future of AI music Your internet browser does not belong to you üîå Charge right into summer with the best travel adapters , power banks , and USB hubs Platforms and power reporter Topics twitter content moderation elections Elon Musk Matt Burgess Vittoria Elliott Will Knight Vittoria Elliott Will Bedingfield Nelson C.J.
