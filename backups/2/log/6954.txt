How much should you spend on a Ring Doorbell? It’s not uncommon to come across pretty good discounts on all models of the Ring Doorbell lineup. The entry level Ring Video Doorbell Wired typically costs $65, and it’s not uncommon to find discounts that have it for $55, and even as low as $50. Such a discount is something to keep an eye out and that’s true for Ring’s other video doorbell models as well.
While the Ring Video Doorbell Wired is Ring’s entry-level model, the newest model is the Ring Video Doorbell 4. We don’t often see discounts on this model, but its regular price is $220. This is similar with the Ring Video Doorbell Pro, which typically costs $260. If a deal on a video doorbell is a must on your shopping list, the Ring Video Doorbell 3 is enough for most people, and while it’s regularly priced at $200, it sees discounts often and it’s not abnormal to come across it discounted as low as $170.
There are also a lot of Ring Doorbell options priced in between the discounted $52 Ring Video Doorbell Wired and the new $220 Ring Video Doorbell 4 and even the $260 Ring Video Doorbell Pro. You should be able to find something for yourself within that price range, whether it be on the currently discounted Ring Video Doorbell, which is just $85, or with other options that can include refurbished models and older generations of current models.
It can seem like there’s a lot of crossover between Ring Doorbell models, and if you’re not sure which Ring Doorbell is right for you and your smart home setup, our Ring Video Doorbell buying guide will be a great resource for you.
