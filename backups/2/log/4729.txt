The Italian automaker earlier this week released a teaser in the form of a silhouette image of the sleek-looking vehicle.

Mitja Borkert, Lamborghini’s head of design, told Auto Express , that its first fully electric supercar will take “1,000% the design DNA of Lamborghini,” adding that it “won’t hurt or disturb any of our other model lines.” The fastest electric cars, ranked by 0-60 mph acceleration Lanzador concept previews Lamborghini’s first EV Tesla shows off first Cybertruck after two years of delays Lamborghini is taking its time transitioning to electric, promising to launch gas-electric hybrid versions of its lineup by 2024 before making its first fully electric supercar.
All eyes will be on what it has come up with for its first fully electric model, not just in terms of design, but also the technology deployed to guarantee the kind of high-performance auto fans expect from a supercar.
The unveiling of Lamborghini’s first all-electric car comes just a few months after it launched the Revuelto plug-in hybrid that replaces its Aventador supercar.
Commenting on auto electrification in an interview in April, Lamborghini chief technology officer Rouven Mohr acknowledged that “the social environment has changed,” pointing to factors such as stricter emissions regulations and the likelihood of some cities, particularly in Europe, possibly moving toward limiting road access to cars with some degree of electrification.
Mohr added that improvements to the technology underpinning components such as batteries have also helped Lamborghini to increase its focus on developing a range of hybrid and fully electric vehicles.

Cars As we head into a world of electric cars, charging is the biggest concern for many first-time buyers. It makes sense. While the hype for electric cars themselves is arguably justified, the biggest drawback is the fact that you have to charge them, and right now, that can be a bit of a hassle.
That’s not only because of the fact that you have to wait to charge — but also because of the fact that there are different types of electric car chargers, and you may not be able to charge an electric car with all of those different types.
Cars Electric cars have come a long way over the past few years. Gone are the days when the thought of an electric car was a novelty — these days, EVs are common, (mostly) available, and for the most part, refined.
But they’re also still relatively expensive, especially for a good one. That’s exactly why you might be thinking about buying a used one.
