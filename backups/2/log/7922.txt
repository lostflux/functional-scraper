Why trust us? What is Disney+ Premier Access, and how much does it cost? By Lucas Coll Close Image used with permission by copyright holder Although it came to the crowded streaming scene late, Disney+ — the premium streaming service from the House of Mouse — quickly distinguished itself from the herd to become a must-have subscription for fans of all things Disney, Marvel, and Star Wars. And now, with things opening back up and movies hitting theaters again, members can take advantage of Disney+ Premier Access, which allows viewers to stream new films like Cruella and Black Widow right from home. Here’s how much it’ll cost you.
A standard Disney+ subscription costs just $80 per year or $8 per month (which comes to $96 per year before taxes) if you prefer a more flexible monthly plan, which is a pretty solid value considering that this premium streaming service gets you access to the entire catalog of Disney, Pixar, Marvel, and Star Wars content, among more. Disney+ Premier Access isn’t an add-on to your monthly or yearly subscription, however; instead, it’s a one-time $30 fee that gives you early access to new movie releases before they’re available to all subscribers.
Disney+ Premier Access was first rolled out alongside the release of Mulan , with Raya and the Last Dragon being the second new film to be made available on the service.
Cruella, starring Emma Stone as the titular fur coat-obsessed villain from the classic 101 Dalmatians, is scheduled for release on May 28, is next on the list, with the new Marvel movie Black Widow coming later in the summer.
Cruella is available for pre-order until May 27 while Premier Access to Black Widow will be on tap on July 9th.
How to watch NBA basketball from anywhere for free How much is Apple TV+? How much does Netflix cost? A breakdown of the streamer’s plans When you purchase or pre-order a film with Disney+ Premier Access, you can stream it to your heart’s content right from the comfort of your couch as soon as it hits theaters. You can also re-watch it as many times as you like on any compatible streaming device as long as your Disney+ account is active. Note that Premier Access is only available to those with a Disney+ subscription.
Disney+ by itself rings in at $80 per year or $8 per month, but the better value is the Disney Bundle. Signing up for the Disney Bundle gets you Disney+ along with ESPN+ and basic Hulu for just $14 per month, saving you 25% on the combined price of these three services. If you already have one or two of these, you can still upgrade to the bundle and take advantage of the discount. After that, pre-ordering a new film with Disney Premier Access costs $30.
Editors' Recommendations UFC PPV: How much is the UFC 295 PPV? What’s new on Apple TV+ this month (November 2023) What is Apple TV+? Pricing, features, how to get it, and more Disney+, Hulu, ESPN+ get new pricing schemes this fall What is Disney Plus: plans, price, and everything else you should know Streaming Services Tech News Audio / Video Paramount Plus — the streaming service once known as CBS All Access — has come a long way in a relatively short amount of time. It started as the streaming home for all things CBS. But executives quickly saw the writing on the well. Streaming was the future, and CBS was an America-only brand.
So in March 2021, a pivot occurred. CBS All Access became Paramount Plus. And soon thereafter, parent company ViacomCBS transitioned into Paramount Global, taking its streaming service worldwide, taking with it exclusive content that otherwise might have remained domestic. (Some still has different global distributors, but that's another problem for another time.) Entertainment Pixar loves its high concepts, and concepts don't get much higher than Element City in the studio's latest release, Elemental. Element City is a place where very human-like elemental beings of water, Earth, and fire live side-by-side. But by their very nature, water and fire can't touch without turning the water into steam. That doesn't stop an immigrant from Fire Town, Ember Lumen (Leah Lewis), from starting a romantic relationship with Wade Ripple (Mamoudou Athie), a water being who is head over heels in love with her.
Ronnie del Carmen also lends his voice to the film alongside Shila Ommi, Wendi McLendon-Covey, Catherine O'Hara, Mason Wertheimer, Ronobir Lahiri, Wilma Bonet, Joe Pera, Matt Yang King, Jeff LaPensee, Ben Morris, Alex Kapp, Jonathan Adams, and P.L. Brown. Peter Sohn directed Elemental and came up with the story alongside the film's screenwriters John Hoberg, Kat Likkel, and Brenda Hsueh.
Audio / Video These days, there's a streaming service for practically everything. Many are not cheap, though, and it seems like the major streamers announce price hikes every few months. However, the growth of the big players is starting to plateau, with customers feeling maxed out and looking for other ways to watch while keeping more money in their pockets. For those reasons, it may be time for advertising video on demand (AVOD) and free ad-supported streaming television (FAST) services to shine. Services like Tubi, Pluto, the Roku Channel, and more recently, Google TV, among others, are starting to position themselves to be at the forefront of the surging streaming segments.
But we digress -- we're here to talk about one of those big players, Tubi, an AVOD/FAST (we'll refer to it as just free streaming going forward) service that boasts a catalog of more than 50,000 movies and TV shows, and 200 live TV channels -- for free. Definitely be sure to check out our list of the best shows on TV shows on Tubi.
