Pricing and monthly fees Smart Home We sort of take it for granted, today, that any device we get will come with its own rechargeable battery. When we do get a device that requires a battery — usually AA or AAA — there is often an associated level of "pain" with this news. Kitchen shelves are opened and closed, the ubiquitous junk drawer is sifted, and there is possibly a trip to the store to be had. Why can't everything just use USB-C cables, again? In any event, you can get 240 batteries, 120 AA and 120 AAA, for just $47 over at Woot right now. Not only will this save you the woes of battery finding when you need them, but it will also save you $103 from the initial price of $150. These batteries are only on sale until supplies dry up or the 30th, so be sure to tap the button below and pick up yours today.
Why you should buy AA and AAA Amazon Basics Batteries It is a bit surprising, but both AA and AAA batteries are needed in today's world. For example, wireless game controllers might require AA batteries. Small TV remotes, such as those that come with the best TVs, are likely to use AAA batteries. Another quirk of batteries is that you really shouldn't mix and match them too much, as having equally powerful batteries is important for most devices. Buying in bulk can be incredibly convenient due to the large stock of uniformly powerful batteries such a person generates.

If you're interested in taking advantage of this offer, you're going to have to hurry with your purchase because it may disappear sooner than you expect.
