Editors' Recommendations 2023 Feast Week live stream: watch Thanksgiving college basketball for free What’s new on Tubi in December 2023 Everything coming to Disney+ in December 2023 2023 Champions Classic live stream: watch college basketball for free Don’t let these 3 hidden gem November streaming TV shows fly under your radar Peacock Tech News Entertainment Generally, we tend to give streamers the benefit of the doubt when it comes to their film libraries. But there's no getting around the fact that the science fiction selection on Peacock is awful. For every Back to the Future, there are dozens of low-budget schlock-fests like Atlantic Rim, Lord of the Elves, and Dino King. Those are all real movies on Peacock, but they aren't worth your time. And unfortunately, there's nothing new on Peacock in November in the popular genre.
With such a thin selection to work with, it can be truly challenging to find sci-fi flicks on Peacock that are worth watching. But after an exhaustive search, we've come up with the following three sci-fi movies on Peacock that you need to watch in November.
Freejack (1992) Entertainment Because of the twin actors and writers strikes in Hollywood, Comic-Con was a lot quieter than usual for companies like Netflix. However, Netflix has its own streaming events to make big announcements for next year's biggest shows. And they don't get much bigger than the live-action Avatar: The Last Airbender series. The adaptation of the beloved Nickelodeon animated series finally has a premiere date: February 22, 2024. Netflix also dropped the first trailer, which will look very familiar to fans of the original show.
Avatar: The Last Airbender | Official Teaser | Netflix Entertainment Peacock doesn't always get a chance to strut its stuff, but it does have an impressive lineup of films. They just don't stick around for long compared to the other streamers. Keep this in mind when we share our picks for the three underrated movies on Peacock. Most content new on Peacock has a very short shelf life.
This month, our picks include a hilarious mocumentary, a largely forgotten superhero flick, and a romantic comedy about the end of the world. These are the three underrated movies on Peacock you need to watch in November.
