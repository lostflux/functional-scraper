Outcasters is a battle royale-style game that allowed players to get creative with their shots, controlling their direction and speed after firing them off. Unlike Fortnite , its multiplayer mode caps the number of players to eight. The London-based Splash Damage tweeted a statement Wednesday saying it had no plans to port Outcasters because it was programmed exclusively for Stadia, as its complex gameplay mechanics required the use of cloud streaming technology.
“It is with a heavy heart that we inform you that we do not have plans to bring Outcasters to other platforms at this time.
Outcasters was designed and built exclusively for Stadia, with many of its systems heavily reliant on the platform, significantly increasing the complexity of the work required,” Splash Damage said. “We still firmly believe that cloud gaming has a bright future in our industry, providing easier access to games than ever before, and we are encouraged to see that other platforms still champion this cause.” Gylt, Google Stadia’s first exclusive, is coming to other platforms Ubisoft and more offer ways to play purchased Google Stadia games elsewhere Google Stadia shutting down in January and users are getting full refunds To give Outcasters a proper requiem, Splash Damage shared a video that takes a look back at the game’s development stages, from its early concept to its July 13 release day, as well as an idea of what the gameplay looks like for those who weren’t aware of its existence.

Tequila Works is porting Gylt to other platforms next year, though it’s unknown what consoles will get it. Meanwhile, Ubisoft and other developers are giving players alternatives for playing games they purchased on Stadia.

Leading the pack is Google Stadia, which doesn't need anything but a browser and a controller -- no expensive hardware purchases are required on your end.
But Stadia isn't alone in the cloud gaming space. Shadow aims to grab your hard-earned cash by taking a different route. From afar, however, both look similar at first glance, but there are huge differences between them, and those differences give one of these competitors a clear edge.
Gaming Google Stadia wants to revolutionize the way you play video games, eliminating the need to buy powerful hardware or even download games. Instead, it offers instant access the second you want to play them.
Stadia is not alone in this field, however. It has many adversaries, and one of the most formidable is Nvidia’s GeForce Now service. Nvidia's alternative has received a lot of press, both good and bad. Is it a serious alternative? Let's find out! Gaming It’s 2021 and playing video games no longer requires you to pop in a disc. Instead, we now have digital downloads and, more recently, game-streaming services that let you instantly begin playing the latest titles without having to install anything.
Two of the biggest game-streaming services are Google Stadia and Microsoft’s Xbox Cloud Gaming, formerly called Project xCloud or just xCloud. Both promise unprecedented freedom and ease of use for players, but they also have their drawbacks.
