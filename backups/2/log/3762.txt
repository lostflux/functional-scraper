Photograph: Nintendo A Rich Open World The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom To say this game was highly anticipated would be an understatement.
The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom follows the Nintendo Switch launch title Breath of the Wild —one of the best games of all time. This sequel sees our hero Link endowed with new powers and the sprawling world of Hyrule expanded and revamped.
According to WIRED reviewer Will Bedingfield, Tears of the Kingdom is all about evolving the things that made Breath of the Wild such a wonderful experience. Gameplay systems feel tighter and more refined, even the brand-new Ultrahand abilities that let you combine items from your environment to build machines, weapons, and just about anything else you can imagine.

It’s still in early access, though it will eventually be released as a free-to-play game. Our review goes into full detail , but suffice it to say that this game is immersive, glorious, and as cozy as it gets. While characters like Remy and Elsa may seem familiar, the dialog is surprisingly poignant. It’s a game made by Disney, but I never felt too old to play. If you’re missing life simulations but just can’t bring yourself to restart Stardew Valley , give this one a shot.

The game plays like a 3D Mario game, à la Mario 64 , but instead of collecting stars, you're hunting for nearly 1,000 moons that propel your airship. The worlds are quirky and densely packed with new gameplay, like Mario's new living hat that lets him inhabit classic Super Mario creatures like Goombas and Chomp Chains. We called it “ a surrealist triumph ” in our review.
1 - 2 players can play together $60 at Amazon $60 at Target $60 at Nintendo Store Courtesy of Nintendo For Taking it Easy Cozy Grove There’s irony in the fact that a really good life simulation game can result in burnout. Hyperfocusing for hours on little side quests, tasks, and to-do lists is a surefire way to get sick of something.
Cozy Grove is designed with exactly this pitfall in mind. There are no consequences for failing to get a ton done in a day—in fact, that’s kind of the premise. It’s a super fun and cute game that doesn’t encourage players to binge it for 40 hours at a time. Bathe your island in light and color, help ghost bears with their purgatory-like existence, and collect oodles of badges for your efforts. For what it's worth, I found the gaming experience better on PC than on Nintendo Switch.

If you're unfamiliar, they're like point-and-click adventures that you explore through dialog options; think Dream Daddy and Hatoful Boyfriend.
Princess Farmer packs familiar visual novel storytelling and relationship-building into a satisfying and puzzling match-3 game. The world and characters are memorable, adorable, and queer as hell. I mean that in the best way.
Playing a game that centers queer relationships and stories without wallowing in pain and despair is so refreshing.
Princess Farmer is a celebration of queerness and queer joy that is so rarely seen in games and is even more rarely the center of the story. That's not to mention how addictive the match-3 gameplay is. It's a brilliant debut from Samobee Games.
1 - 2 local players can date bunnies together $15 at Nintendo Switch eStore Courtesy of Nintendo For Dancing Farmers Ooblets Ooblets has been a long time favorite on PC and Xbox, where the early access version has been available for a couple years now. This new release for Nintendo Switch is the full version. Polished, completed, and right on the console I wanted, Ooblets is an absolute delight to play. The art and character designs draw you right into the world, while the witty writing and clever game design keep you there. In Ooblets , you farm like you might in games like Stardew Valley , but your crops are tiny little critters called Ooblets that you train in the ancient art of the dance battle. It's a whole thing, and it's easily one of our favorites to come out in 2022.

Even if you've never had this incredibly specific dream, Death's Door is a brilliant action RPG in a beautifully realized world filled with memorable characters. You take on the role of a Crow (capital C) tasked with collecting souls, but when the one you're after gets stolen right from under you, things get a little weird.
The illustrative art style draws you into a world that is every bit as dark as it is comedic. I spent hours upon hours in this one, exploring every nook and cranny, trying to unravel the mysteries at the heart of this adorably somber world. If you're a fan of third-person action, Zelda-esque roguelikes, you should definitely check this one out.

Pokémon Arceus takes you way back in time to an era when humans were first starting to encounter Pokémon, and the changes don't end there. This is the first open-world game in the entire series—a huge departure, but a welcome one.
Arceus doesn't get everything right on the first try. The world isn't quite as seamless or engaging as the one you'll find in Breath of the Wild , but running around in the open air catching Pokémon in real time is a fun twist on classic gameplay. Definitely give it a look if you're a fan of the Pokémon series.

That's when Rose unknowingly uses the power of a magic book to wish they'll stay together, causing the parents to shrink into tiny toys that must find their way back to their daughter. There's a lot of relationship repairing along the way.

Disco Elysium: The Final Cut is an award-winning, critically acclaimed roleplaying game that puts you in the shoes of a detective who is, well … he's certainly an experience.
 It's not your average roleplaying game, either. The emphasis is on solving a mystery while navigating complex conversations and interactions using just your wits and charm, not on pumping up your strength to better defeat your enemies. The game's tagline is “Become a hero or an absolute disaster of a human being,” and it's honestly the best way to describe Disco Elysium.
I mean that as a compliment. It's funny, wild, delightfully unhinged, and filled with memorable characters and situations that will inevitably end in your demise.

Robust social features let you live your island dreams alongside your real-life friends (though local co-op is a little lacking).
AC:NH will be familiar to Animal Crossing fans, but there are enough new aspects to keep you intrigued if you've played other games in the series. This title is especially great if you could use a mental break.
The Happy Home Paradise DLC adds a new resort area, interior design challenges for villagers, and a ton of new design options throughout the game.

The linear story of previous Zelda games is gone entirely, replaced by a wide-open world with dungeons and hidden secrets you can tackle as you wish.
Breath of the Wild is sometimes more difficult and holds your hand less, but it's amazingly fun to explore Hyrule, and you'll enjoy making mistakes. Did we mention Link can climb any mountain you see in this picture? Read our full review.
The Expansion Pass DLC also adds challenge modes to test your combat skills; Hero's Path Mode, which can track the path you've traveled over up to 200 hours of gameplay; and a ton of new items from the Zelda franchise history that you can discover and wear. It's worth playing this before hopping into Tears of the Kingdom.

What was the last game you played without combat? Spiritfarer is a game about death, but even so, you spend your time building, crafting, and caring for the spirits of the recently dead. The only thing you’ll fight is the urge to cry. You guide the spirits as they come to terms with their deaths, their lives, and their traumas. When you’ve done your job, you take them to the other side —the afterlife.
This game feels like stepping into a Miyazaki film—from the breathtaking art, score, and engaging gameplay to the thoughtfully written characters who make you well up. Each and every character will leave its mark on you—even characters you loathe.
Yes, we're talking about Giovanni. Don’t worry, you’ll see. Go fare some spirits.

The stirring, driven competition of 100 players set against one another scales down to the portable framework of the Switch shockingly well, making for snappy, thrilling play sessions. And Fortnite is a much better game than its critics make it out to be, with a winning aesthetic, sharp gunplay, and dense but satisfying building mechanics. Best yet, it's always changing, cycling through more ideas in a play season than some games do in their lifetime.

It comes in a kit with more than 20 sheets of cardboard. You'll spend hours folding and building the five Labo widgets in the Variety Kit, following fun onscreen instructions. There's an RC car, fishing pole, piano, house, and motorcycle handlebars. Once you're done, you snap the Switch screen and Joy-Con controllers into their spots in each Labo Toy-Con and play games with them. The Vehicle Kit is our favorite.

And you’ll die a lot. (That’s part of the fun. No, really!) Dead Cells is a roguelike game along the lines of a Castlevania , but it is more than the sum of its predecessors. With rich progression and a clever blend of randomized and static world elements, Dead Cells offers a uniquely approachable (and addictive) spin on a classic genre.

Honestly, we'd play it on any device, because the game is nearly flawless.
 It's fast-paced, beautiful, and hard as hell (in a good way). You'll play as Zagreus, the son of Hades. Your sole purpose? To escape the underworld. The task is a whole lot easier said than done, but luckily, you'll get a little bit stronger each time you fail.

This version has the same basic walk-and-suck gameplay, though you can now slam ghosts around and create a Goo-based duplicate of yourself (controllable by another player!).
The hotel you explore has a lot of fun floors filled with things you'll never find in an actual hotel, like a desert, a movie studio, a pirate ship, and a castle. It's a tough game at times, but it's so packed full of secrets and cash (yes, ghosts apparently like to hide a lot of cash), that it never gets too repetitive.

Why does it look so good, you ask? Well, it’s hand-drawn. Every frame of this quirky and offbeat platformer was drawn by hand and animated with traditional cel animation, and all of that painstaking work shows. This is a tough game, but the rich details make it like nothing else you’ve ever played.

Yet developer Witch Beam pulled it off with Unpacking.

Captain Toad was one of the best Wii U games, and we're elated it's now available on the Switch. Instead of hopping around like Mario, Captain Toad places you into dozens of compact puzzle worlds where you must avoid danger and explore to find treasure.

 Depending on the pack you get, players may find themselves designing awful T-shirt slogans, drawing Pictionary-style, competing in trivia contests, or sleuthing out fibbers from the group. Instead of using Joy-Cons or other controllers, players use their phones or tablets and a web browser. With some effort, you can even play with friends long-distance.

Originally released in 2013 as a series of episodes and interludes that were sold individually, the Switch version compiles the entire catalog of Kentucky Route Zero stories into a single volume. It's a game Switch owners have been clamoring for, and it doesn't disappoint. Even though it's a couple of years old, the stories, art, and music feel as fresh and vital as ever. If you're a fan of a slow-burn kind of story, this is one you shouldn't miss.

Each person controls a paper character (Snip and Clip), and you must work together to cut each other into the right shapes to solve a wide variety of physics-based puzzles. It's the kind of game that will test your patience—and your relationships. The Plus version adds extra levels and four-player modes.

The gameplay is turn-based and tactical. You move Mario and other characters around a grid filled with obstacles and chain their attacks together to strategically take out opponents.

You're given a series of increasingly difficult tasks, almost all of which involve acts of petty (and not so petty) larceny and vandalism, which you need to complete without being thwarted by the townsfolk of an idyllic English country village. It's a self-described slapstick-stealth-sandbox game, with a surprising degree of replay value. Seriously, once you finish your initial to-do list (yes this goose has a to-do list), the game restarts with an even more difficult version of that list, challenging you to be the very best goose you can be.

It's the first mainline Pokémon game on a home console , which is exciting new territory, but it's also a return to the classic Pokémon formula longtime fans will be familiar with. It's approachable for beginners and deep enough for seasoned trainers to enjoy spending hours in the forests and meadows of the Galar region trying to catch them all. The newest Pokémon game— Scarlet and Violet —hit store shelves last year to some mixed reviews, and but it's worth looking at if you want the latest.

You'll also like it if you like cats. Mario has a catsuit, and the game is littered with cat-themed things. It really blends some of the exploration of 3D Mario games with the simplicity and speed of the sidescrollers. It lets you move in 3D, but the levels are more directional and your goal is to race to the flag pole at the end, like a classic Mario game. Since the camera is fixed in place, you don't have to constantly tweak it, simplifying the whole experience.
Since this is an upgraded port of a Wii U game, Nintendo also included an extra game called Bowser's Fury , which plays more like a traditional 3D Mario title where you have to work with Bowser Jr. (Player 2 can control him!) to find cat shines on a series of islands to save them from a massive, Godzilla-sized Bowser. It's different, but also a ton of fun in its own way.
