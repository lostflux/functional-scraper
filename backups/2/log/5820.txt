 This indie game will keep you on your toes and on the edge of your seat.
Read less Cadence of Hyrule: Crypt of the NecroDancer Featuring The Legend of Zelda Nintendo Switch Music, Adventure, Indie Brace Yourself Games Nintendo, Spike ChunSoft June 13, 2019 From the studio that created Crypt of the NecroDancer , Brace Yourself Games effectively combines rhythm gameplay with the aesthetics and themes of a beloved 2D Zelda experience.
It has all the things you love about Zelda: Bosses, dungeons, items to collect, and music. As you venture through the game, you have to collect items that you’ll need to battle the final boss before beating the game. The twist is that it features roguelike elements that restructure the layout of the map each time. That means no two runs are the same.
Since no two runs are the same, you have to prepare for anything. This makes each attempt at the game fun and engaging.
Read less Nintendo Switch gamers will always have an array of game options available to them. Indie game developers create action games, strategy games, and simulations for the Switch platform. You’ll find it all here, from something new and fresh to the classics you live. Plus, new releases launch all the time, making the platform even more dynamic.

Editors' Recommendations The best handheld gaming PCs you can buy The best Mario games of all time, ranked The best Call of Duty games, ranked One of the best sci-fi games ever made is coming to Nintendo Switch next month Indie World Showcase November 2023: How to watch and what to expect Nintendo Nintendo Switch Gaming Netflix announced a slew of new games coming its mobile gaming platform. The list is headlined by Supergiant Games' 2020 hit Hades, which will be available on mobile devices for any Netflix subscriber when it launches.
Netflix Games launched in 2021 and continues to expand its offering of titles. The company upped its commitment to gaming during today's Geeked Week stream, which revealed several games coming to the platform. Hades is the crown jewel, but several other notable games are coming to the platform soon.
Gaming While the jumps have been getting smaller and smaller between generations, there's always a nice graphical bump to look forward to when picking up the latest hardware. We're long past the days of going from 16-bit 2D games to full-on 3D, and even the jump from SD to HD, but the visual improvements we got between the PS4 and PS5 are still striking. Not only are resolutions higher, but new techniques like ray tracing are now possible and starting to show up in more titles as we get deeper into the console's life.
Now that it's been out for a decent amount of time, and we have a wide selection of both upgraded titles and ones made exclusively for the PS5, there are a few that have risen to the top that anyone looking to show off the power of their new console will want to grab. Not only are all the games on this list visually impressive -- not just necessarily photorealistic, mind you -- but they're also a blast to play. Graphics don't make a game fun, but it just works out that the best-looking games on PS5 are also some of the best-playing. Here are our picks for the PS5 games with the best graphics.

We have a mix of hardcore survival experiences like Frostpunk and minimalist builders like Islanders, so there's something for everyone.
