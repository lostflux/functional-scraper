It includes lots of quality-of-life improvements over its predecessor, the PlayStation 4, such as faster load times, a solid-state drive (SSD) instead of a regular hard disk drive (HDD), and an improved controller in the form of the new DualSense.

Gaming Madden NFL Football is one of the most popular video game franchises of all time, and today its newest iteration — Madden NFL 24 — is seeing a massive discount. You can get Madden NFL 24 for just $43 at Amazon right now, and it’s available at that price for both the Xbox Series X and the PlayStation 5. The game regularly costs $70, making this deal worth a savings of $27. Free shipping is included with a purchase as well.
Why you should buy Madden NFL 24 The Madden NFL video game franchise is a staple in sports gaming, with previous versions of the game still among the best sports games on Xbox Series X. Madden NFL 24 advances the franchise significantly, bringing what’s known as Sapien Technology to the game. It’s a leap forward in character technology and makes the football players within the game more responsive and truer to player motion in real life. This also brings improvements in gameplay realism, as it tends to feel more lifelike as you control the players in different ways. Madden’s FieldSENSE also provides an enhanced gameplay foundation that gives you greater control.
Gaming With Marvel's Spider-Man 2 for the PlayStation 5 released and already receiving rave reviews, gamers who haven't played its predecessor, Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales, may want to take advantage of Walmart's offer. Instead of $70, you can get the game's Ultimate Edition for just $43, for savings of $27. On top of that, you'll also get a digital copy of Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered. That's a lot of value from one of the most attractive PS5 game deals that we've come across recently, which is why we don't expect this bargain to last long. Buy it now while you still can.
Why you should buy Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales for PS5 Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales continues the story of Marvel's Spider-Man, but shifts the focus on the titular character amid the chaos of New York. There's a lot of similarities between Miles Morales and Peter Parker -- including their acrobatic web-slinging and explosive combat skills -- but there are also significant differences such as Miles' bio-electric venom blast attacks and camouflage power. You'll have to master them quickly though, as a war has broken out in the middle of the city.
