Why trust us? Wordle is now playable on New York Times Crossword app By Cristina Alexander Close The New York Times announced that Wordle is now playable within The New York Times Crossword app on Android and iOS.

The app itself is free to download, but it requires you to sign up for a seven-day free trial in order to continue to play Wordle on the app instead of the browser. However, you will still be able to save your streaks and stats with a free New York Times account.
Of course, players can already save their Wordle game data with a free New York Times account with WordleBot, introduced in July. WordleBot is a companion tool that helps players improve their daily performance by giving them a score between 0-99 based on luck and skill, and also gives advice on how they could do better in future puzzles.

The court was constructed at Barclays Center and inside Roblox for the New York Liberty's August 2 and August 3 home games against the Los Angeles Sparks.
In addition to being the first video game-inspired court for the WNBA, the Xbox and Roblox-themed court is also the first secondary court among the current teams. While we don't know if the court will be there temporarily or permanently, Xbox and Roblox integrated it into Dunking Simulator with features like fireworks, fan chants, and pyrotechnics. It even includes guidance from 11-year-old sports journalist and broadcaster, Pepper Persley.
Gaming It was, in a sense, ironic. Wordle was born from a husband's desire to make something fun for his partner. And for the better part of a half-hour this week, I managed to use it to cause a great deal of consternation for mine. That it was done inadvertently is of no matter.

Gaming Hasbro has announced it is collaborating with The New York Times to create a Wordle: The Party Game, the board game adaptation of the uber-popular mobile word game. The gameplay is the same, but it's being brought to players "in an all new way that's perfect for game night with family and friends," according to a press release.
In this version of Wordle, one player is designated as the Wordle Host in each round and writes down the secret five-letter word. The other players have to compete against each other to guess the word in six tries or less, with the winner being the player that scores the fewest points by the end of the game.
