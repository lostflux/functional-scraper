And this fall they’re going to get a little more complex — and more expensive. And more countries are getting more options.
First up: Canada and some European nations will get the ad-supported option for Disney+ starting November 1, 2023. It’ll run $8 in the former, and 5 pounds or 6 euros in the latter. Current subscribers will stay in the ad-free plan unless they actively decide to switch.
That’s the simplest of the changes and additions. In the U.S., things are getting more complicated, with additional options and a number of pricing changes across Disney+, Hulu , and ESPN+ — and with all three as the Disney Bundle.
Phil Nickinson / Digital Trends “The strong momentum of our ad-supported plans in the U.S. demonstrates the importance of providing consumers with choice, flexibility and value,” Joe Earley, president of direct-to-consumer for Disney Entertainment, said in a press release. “We are excited to expand that offering in more markets across the globe, including in Europe and Canada, and to launch a new premium duo bundle of ad-free Disney+ and Hulu this fall, as we take steps toward making extensive Hulu content available via Disney+ later this year for Bundle subscribers.” How to watch NBA basketball from anywhere for free YouTube TV still leads after latest round of streaming numbers Disney+ and Hulu drop first trailer for Marvel’s Echo Here’s the breakdown across the board: Disney+ pricing With ads: unchanged at $8 a month Without ads: $14 a month, or $140 a year, effective October 12 Hulu pricing With ads: unchanged at $8 a month, or $80 a year Without ads: $18 a month, with no annual option, effective October 12 Hulu With Live TV: $77 a month with ads on the on-demand content, $90 a month without ads Disney+ (without advertising) add-on costs $2 a month ESPN+ add-on costs $11 a month ESPN+ pricing Now $11 a month or $110 a year, effective October 12 UFC pay-per-view standalone unchanged at $80 per event Single UFC PPV event plus an annual ESPN+ subscription is $135, effective October 12 Disney Bundle pricing Disney Bundle Duo Premium, which includes Disney+ and Hulu without ads for $20 a month Disney Bundle Duo Basic, which includes Disney+ and Hulu (both with ads) for $10 per month Disney Bundle Trio Basic with sports, which includes Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ (all with ads) for $15 per month Disney Bundle Trio Premium with Disney+, Hulu (both with no ads), and ESPN+ (with ads) for $25 per month On the subscriber numbers side of the ledger, Disney+ now stands at 46 million subscribers in the U.S. and Canada, down about 300,000 from the previous quarter. It has just shy of 106 million worldwide. ESPN+ now stands at 25.2 million subscribers, down about 100,000 from the previous quarter. And Hulu has 44 million subscribers of its on-demand service — up about 300,000 — and 4.3 million subs of Hulu With Live TV.
Editors' Recommendations ESPN+: Live sports and more you can’t get anywhere else Combined Disney+/Hulu app to launch in beta in December F1 live stream: Watch Formula 1 online for free Disney will soon own 100% of Hulu What’s new on Disney+ in November 2023 Entertainment Disney+ Hulu Streaming Services Tech News Entertainment October is over and Huluween is in the rearview mirror at Hulu. That's why horror flicks on loan from other studios like Shaun of the Dead, The Omen, It, and the first seven Saw movies are all getting the big boot in November. Even our perennial favorite Christmas movie, Die Hard, won't be around long after Thanksgiving.
The good news is that there are always new movies and TV shows on Hulu coming throughout the month. And you don't have to let your favorite films rush off to some other streamer without getting a chance to watch them again. You have a full month to make to time watch everything leaving Hulu in November 2023. Our favorite picks are in bold.
Entertainment It may be the beginning of November, but Christmas is coming a little early to Hulu. It's not like there aren't Thanksgiving movies, but Hulu is piling on the Christmas flicks like they're appetizers for Turkey Day. You know it's that time of the year when both versions of Miracle on 34th Street are streaming, along with a lot of made-for-TV holiday films that you may not have heard of before.
Fortunately, Hulu is about more than just Christmas cheer in November. The fan-favorite Men in Black trilogy is back on Hulu, and FX is premiering the long-awaited new season of Fargo with Jon Hamm in a leading role. And for fans of classic '80s TV, L.A. Law is setting up shop on Hulu as well. That may be your new favorite binge series this month.
Audio / Video Since its launch in November of 2019, Apple TV+ has elbowed its way on to the playing field of streaming services from Netflix and Amazon Prime Video to Disney+, Max, Hulu, and a plethora of others to become, for many, a go-to option for movies, TV series, and sports. Since then the ad-free service has amassed an estimated 25 million subscribers globally, with many more than that reportedly cashing in on the company's penchant for free promotional subscriptions after you buy a new Apple device like an iPhone or MacBook.
What sets Apple TV+ apart from the rest of the herd is that it's the only service that offers exclusively original content and only its own original content; meaning no seasons of Rick and Morty or Friends licensed from their respective networks and no blockbuster flicks from other studios, but you can get those elsewhere. This may or may not be a bad thing, as so far Apple has done a pretty good job at making some of the most compelling original content out there, including award-winning series such as Ted Lasso, The Morning Show, and Severance to some of the best sci-fi series around, like Silo and Invasion, as well as live sports from Major League Baseball and Major League Soccer.
