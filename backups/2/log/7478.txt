Why trust us? T-Mobile wants you to test drive its 5G home internet By Jesse Hollington Close T-Mobile is taking a bold new step into 5G home internet with a new program that will make it easier for broadband customers to “break up with Big Internet.” During a live-streamed event today, T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert unveiled the carrier’s new “Internet Freedom” initiative, which he hopes will fix the “broken” broadband industry by giving folks an easy path to move to wireless 5G home internet.
Image used with permission by copyright holder “The Un-carrier was created to fix a stupid, broken wireless industry,” Sievert said, adding that, “with Internet Freedom, we’re taking on Big Internet and bringing the Un-carrier movement to broadband.” In his remarks, the T-Mobile CEO compared the broadband industry today with “the wireless industry a decade ago” and said his company plans to change that.
T-Mobile’s Internet Freedom will give potential customers an easy way to try out fixed wireless 5G broadband without switching away from their current broadband provider.
Have an Android phone? You can get unlimited 5G service for free How fast is 5G? What you need to know about 5G speeds The 5G speed race is over and T-Mobile has won Similar to T-Mobile’s test drive program for 5G phones , you’ll be able to try the company’s 5G home internet for 15 days with no obligation. Further, since no wires are involved, you can keep your current provider hooked up. If things don’t work out, nothing needs to change.
However, T-Mobile is naturally banking on winning people over, and it’s so confident that it’s willing to cover up to $500 in early termination fees to help ease the transition to its 5G home internet service.
No pricing games T-Mobile also added that it won’t be playing the pricing games common to many other wired broadband providers. The company said that while internet providers often provide promotional offers, those prices get raised more than 30% on average.
With T-Mobile’s 5G home internet, pricing will be locked in at $50 per month for as long as you’re a customer. “Only [the customer] can change what they pay for broadband,” T-Mobile said.
What’s even more interesting is that T-Mobile is treating its 5G Home Internet just like another line on its Magenta Max family plan, so users who already subscribe to T-Mobile’s wireless phone services can get home internet for only $30 per month.
The Un-carrier will also be offering its T-Mobile Tuesdays incentives to broadband customers. Starting next Tuesday, May 10, T-Mobile will kick off the program with a $50 discount on any streaming device to make it even easier for folks to ditch their internet and TV bundles.
Editors' Recommendations This new MediaTek chip is about to bring 5G to a lot more devices T-Mobile still has the fastest 5G, but its rivals are catching up T-Mobile’s huge lead in 5G speeds isn’t going anywhere Netgear’s new M6 Pro router lets you use fast 5G anywhere you go Live in a rural area? Verizon 5G is about to get better for you 5G Cellular Carriers T-Mobile Tech News Mobile T-Mobile has just unveiled a new set of plans and perks to help both new and current customers break free of lengthy device contracts while guaranteeing you'll be able to get the best deals available on phone upgrades every two years.
Significantly, with the new plans, the "Un-carrier" promises equal treatment for all customers, whether they're coming over from another carrier or have been using T-Mobile's services for years. That's in contrast to the limited-time offers of its rivals, which often ignore their most loyal subscribers in an effort to entice others to switch carriers.
Mobile Each time a new analysis of mobile network performance gets published, it’s almost a given that we’ll see T-Mobile leading the pack in terms of delivering the fastest 5G speeds. After all, the “Un-carrier” had a massive lead in deploying its 5G networks — and it hasn’t been resting on its laurels.
However, its competitors haven’t been sitting still either. While Verizon may have been starting from behind, it’s been aggressively deploying the faster 5G spectrum that gave it a nice leap in 5G performance last year. Still, Verizon and AT&T are lagging quite a bit in overall mobile network performance, and AT&T has fallen even farther behind when it comes to delivering the best 5G speeds across the nation.
Mobile Motorola may be making a play for the flagship market with the Motorola Edge 40 Pro, but budget phones are what the American monolith is best known for. While it won't be making as many waves as the latest Samsung phone or Apple iPhone launch, the newest iteration of the Moto G is always something worth paying attention to, as Motorola is a true veteran of the space and knows what makes an excellent cheap device.
Best of all, this new Moto G comes at a time when budget phone enthusiasts have never had it so good. Previously premium features are filtering down into lower-priced devices, without altering that sweet low price or the features everyone loves. That's exactly what's happening with the new Motorola Moto G Power 5G, which includes a 50-megapixel main camera lens, a larger amount of storage, and a big screen with a 120Hz refresh rate. With the big 5,000mAh battery the G Power range is known for, this could be the $300 phone to grab if you love a budget bargain.
