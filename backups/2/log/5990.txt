Why trust us? Grand Theft Auto V makes its surprise return to Xbox Game Pass today By Giovanni Colantonio Close Rockstar Games Xbox Game Pass is kicking off July with a major surprise, as Grand Theft Auto V has returned to the service. Rockstar’s sales juggernaut leads an otherwise light month for Game Pass, which brings Capcom’s Exoprimal as a day-one launch.
This isn’t the first time that Grand Theft Auto V has been on Game Pass. It was previously on the service circa 2021 but removed from it that August.
 Rockstar has a history of putting its games on Game Pass for a brief window before pulling it, as it also did with Red Dead Redemption 2.
Fortunately for fans, Grand Theft Auto V is now back on both Cloud and Xbox consoles right now. Players can access both the Xbox One and Xbox Series X /S versions of the game. The only catch is that it’s not available for PC players.
Game Pass has a handful of other games coming in July. Dinosaur shooter Exoprimal launches on the platform on July 14, and factory automation game Techtonica will get a day-one release on July 18. Otherwise, this month’s line-up features a few hidden gems. Here’s the full list of games coming to Game Pass in July.
Grand Theft Auto V (Console, Cloud) — Available now Sword and Fairy: Together Forever (Console, PC, Cloud) — Available now MxPixel 3 (Console, PC, Cloud — July 6 Common’hood (Console, Cloud, PC) — July 11 Insurgency: Sandstorm (PC) — July 11 Exoprimal (Cloud, PC, Console) — July 14 Techtonica (Cloud, PC, Console) — July 18 The Cave (Cloud, Console) — July 18 The tradeoff here is that three games are leaving the platform on July 15: Exo One , Spelunky 2 , and Paw Patrol The Movie: Adventure City Calls.
 Make sure to dive into those this month before they’re gone.
Editors' Recommendations Grand Theft Auto 6 is getting its first trailer sooner than you think One of the year’s best reviewed games is coming to Xbox Game Pass The best games on Xbox Game Pass for right now (September 2023) You can’t play Baldur’s Gate 3 on Xbox, but you can play these 6 Game Pass RPGs The bestselling video games of all time Action Games Grand Theft Auto Microsoft Tech News Xbox Gaming Whenever new titles get added to Xbox Game Pass, only a handful of games make a splash. Day one releases like Starfield are always guaranteed to get subscribers logging in, but smaller titles tend to fly under the radar. That's especially the case when it comes to indies that aren't considered "game of the year" material, but probably should be. There's a wealth of inventive, groundbreaking titles at your fingertips -- though sometimes they can disappear from the service before you even realize they were there at all.
If you need help finding something new to dig into, I've got some recommendations. The service is loaded with indie standouts that you may have skimmed over while scrolling through your library. Next time you need something new to play, consider checking one of these games out.
Dordogne Gaming Microsoft finally made the decision to move on from its monthly online-access subscription service Xbox Live Gold. On September 14, Xbox Live Gold will transform into Xbox Game Pass Core, with current Gold subscribers automatically gaining a Game Pass Core subscription.
An Xbox Live subscription tied to online play has existed in some form since Xbox Live launched in 2002, but Xbox Live Gold as we now know it truly came into form in July 2013 when Microsoft started the Games with Gold program that gave subscribers free games each month in addition to that online access. Although Microsoft rolled back some online restrictions in 2021, Games with Gold continues to this day. That will all end when Game Pass Core launches.
Gaming I’m always excited for those two days every month when Xbox drops a blog post detailing the new additions coming to Game Pass. Even in slow months, there’s usually a hidden gem on there that I’m curious about digging into. Though as curious as I am about checking out what’s new, I often forget to scroll to the bottom and see what’s leaving the service. And just as there are a few standouts added to the service each month, Game Pass also tends to quietly lose just as many with each new batch.
That’s exactly the case this July. While the service gains Grand Theft Auto V and Exoprimal this month, it’s also losing two standout indies: Spelunky 2 and Exo One. If you’re looking for some games to play during a slow month for big releases, here’s why you should check out both before they leave the service on July 15.
