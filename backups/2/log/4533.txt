Why trust us? Start your business on the right foot with QuickBooks Online By Lucas Coll Close Image used with permission by copyright holder This content was produced in partnership with Intuit.
Starting a new business is no small feat, and that’s true regardless of how big your team is, whether you’re a young entrepreneur hustling solo or you have a crew on your payroll. But modern and digital tools make it a whole lot easier, offering both convenient and highly-capable solutions for the average business. You can do things that big businesses do, but with far less resources. For example, Intuit’s QuickBooks suite helps you auto-track business income and expenses, pay your employees and partners, and file your taxes, streamlining and automating your bookkeeping. In fact, QuickBooks is one of the best solutions for managing a business, and QuickBooks Online kicks that up a notch.
gives you anytime, anywhere access to business tools for stress-free financial planning and more. Let’s take a close look at how Intuit’s suite, including QuickBooks Online and , are changing the small business world for the better.
Tools that will help your business grow and thrive Running a new small business can be quite limiting in the sense that you don’t have the budget or the resources to utilize the best of the best. When tracking money and finances, for instance, too many young entrepreneurs and administrators fall into the trap of using messy, complex spreadsheets and shy away from the most innovative big-business tools on the mistaken assumption that the software is too complicated. The opposite is the case: Spreadsheets may work for a while, maybe even longer than expected if you’re truly organized, but eventually you’re going to run into some serious limitations. These kinds of disjointed manual solutions also don’t afford the benefits of modern automation in the way that a financial toolkit like QuickBooks can.
QuickBooks Online will help you make smarter business decisions, essentially putting you in the right direction — you could even say on the road to success. You can see what’s in stock and what’s on order in real time, for example, if you run an e-commerce business. You can also track and know exactly where your money is going, and make sure bills and invoices are paid on time, every time. Moreover, you can get paid faster through online payments, card, eCheck, ACH, and more.
enables you to pay your own team faster, too, and it also helps you automate payroll taxes and manage expense reporting. There’s no need to dread tax time any more; QuickBooks makes it easy to track and record all income and expenses so you’re fully prepared when it’s time to file taxes, and with QuickBooks Live, you can connect with a QuickBooks-certified bookkeeper should you need some professional help.
is a single, comprehensive solution for small business and expenses reporting that adds layer upon layer of modern intelligence and support. Easy-to-understand dashboard widgets show you incoming and outgoing funds, so you can track profits and stay in the green. It all grows with you and your business to boot. As the business expands and maybe even eventually becomes a big business — and one of the greats — you can still use the same tools you know and love. The always-on and anywhere access just sweetens the deal, allowing you to manage your entire business from a smartphone if you so desire. And let’s be real, most young entrepreneurs are busy and always on the move.
No matter where you are in your entrepreneurship journey, it’s never too early and no business is too small to start with QuickBooks. QuickBooks Online has everything you need to confidently guide your business as it grows, take complete control of your cashflow, manage your payroll, and more. For a limited time, you can sign up for a big discount: Through Sunday, December 4, you can save 70% on QuickBooks Online and QuickBooks Payroll.

Picture this: You're trying to log in to a service, but you forgot your username because it's unique and doesn't use your email address. Unfortunately, you don't remember your password either. First, you'll need to recover your username and then go through the motions to change your password. But here's the thing: After you log in with your new password, there's no guarantee you'll remember it again a day later or longer. There should be a better way to manage and recover your passwords.
Cybersecurity, or rather the security of your data, is something that concerns everyone. One of the best ways to protect yourself, personally and professionally, is to make sure that you're using secure passwords, along with two-factor authentication wherever applicable. Also, you should never reuse passwords across accounts, which is something that, admittedly, can be quite challenging to do. Keeping track of all your passwords because you likely have so many online accounts is not just troublesome, it's downright impossible. There is just no way to keep tabs on all of that information without writing it down, typing it out, or recording it somewhere.
Deals A great font makes a huge difference when it comes to capturing people's attention, whether it's a potential customer or making an internal training exercise look more interesting. With countless numbers of fonts out there, we know how tough it is to keep them organized and well managed. That's why we're big fans of Connect Fonts. Considered to be the next evolutionary step from Suitcase Fusion -- an industrial-strength font management app -- Connect Fonts is both a desktop-based and cloud-based font manager that offers a wealth of options to help you keep on top of your growing font collection. If you're an avid user of graphic design software or even the best free drawing software, Connect Fonts is going to make your life so much easier.
Start Free Trial OK, so Font management software might not sound interesting but, secretly, you're going to be thrilled at what this offers you. In no time, you'll be telling everyone in your industry how useful Connect Fonts is because it's that good. It's really easy to use with both the desktop and cloud-based applications being a breeze to work your way through. And when we say work, well, not really. Instead, it's simple to find the font you may want and will actually help you feel more inspired.
An intuitive search feature makes sure of that. With extensive granular search options, you can use abstract search terms like adjectives or genres. That way, you can find things in a more natural way than having to think like a computer would. It also has customizable tags so it's much easier to find what you're looking for in a way that makes sense to you. For instance, do you want to assign some particular fonts to a project you're working on? Add a tag marking them for that project. The same goes if you want to keep aside certain fonts for particular clients, making it very simple to find what you're looking for at a later date. Connect Fonts even offers up a very cool font pairing suggestion tool so you can instantly see which fonts complement each other well.
