Two of the biggest announcements were for the new solar-powered Solix batteries (which look to bring Anker into the home energy market) and the Anker Prime series — a lineup of ultra-powerful charging accessories and battery banks.
The Anker Prime series is composed of “premium, high-speed, multi-port devices,” the most notable of which is a USB-C charger available in 67-watt, 100-watt, and 250-watt versions. You’ll also find the Anker Prime Power Bank, which offers 100-watt wireless charging and a 27,000mAh capacity. In other words, it’s ready for whatever electronics you throw at it.

The Anker Reserve Power Bank was also highlighted during RE Charge and is available today for $170. It’s geared toward outdoor enthusiasts, with a 60,000 mAh battery, two USB-C ports, two USB-A ports, and an XT 60 plug for solar charging. Aside from its charging chops, the battery includes a built-in, adjustable light for all your after-dark adventures.

Image used with permission by copyright holder “More consumers than ever are turning to solar energy to power their homes,” said Steven Yang, CEO of Anker. “With Anker Solix, we will leverage our deep expertise in battery storage and power delivery, allowing everyone from homeowners to apartment residents and even campers to store and manage all their energy needs more effectively.” Products in the Solix line will include solar balcony systems, EV car charging stations, portable solutions for your home or RV, and an ultra-portable lineup ideal for camping for powering small indoor electronics.
We should learn more about Solix in the coming months, with a full rollout expected in 2024.
Editors' Recommendations Anker reveals Solix C1000 and Solix F3800 portable power stations Anker is launching an iceless cooler that can chill food for 42 hours Portable wind turbines, solar tent, rolling battery round out Jackery’s CES 2023 launches With swappable battery packs, this power station lets you take your juice to go Best solar powered security cameras of 2022 Mobile Portable Power Stations Tech News Smart Home GoSun's diverse lineup of solar-friendly products is expanding this week with two new portable power stations. The GoSun Power 550 and Power 1,100 are high-capacity batteries designed to help keep your appliances running when off the grid, whether that's due to an outage or being on a camping trip. Much like its other eco-friendly devices, these portable power stations can be charged using solar panels.
These portable power stations have plenty of power output options, including a 600-watt AC, a 1,000W AC, USB-A with QuickCharge 3.0, two 5V 2.4A USB-A plugs, a 60W USB-C plug, and a 12.3V DC. For charging, they use a 12-24V adapter, 18-24V input for solar, or 12V if you're charging it from the car. Both AC outlets are pure sine wave, meaning your electronics get a more consistent feed of power. That's good news for your phones and laptops. It also has a Maximum Power Point Controller (MPPT) built-in, which helps to optimize the gain from solar panels. Other batteries lose a lot of efficiency on this front.
Smart Home Typically, when you're thinking about powering your home sans the grid, you consider using a generator -- whether electric or gas -- like those you might find in some of the best generator deals. You might also use a solar or renewable energy system, but they come with limited support unless you have a backup battery or power delivery network. That's where the EcoFlow DELTA Pro portable home battery comes into play.
When it releases, it will be the largest capacity battery the company has launched to date, with a 3.6kWh to 25kWh range, which is enough to supply an entire family's energy needs for emergency use for up to a week. Fascinating, right? What's more, you can take advantage of an early-release discount if you want one. You can grab it for $2,999, which is $600 off -- it will retail for $3,599.
What makes the EcoFlow DELTA Pro so interesting? It's a challenge to live without power, even if you're off the grid, in a remote location, or spending time at a campsite. You'll still want energy for lights, maybe cooking gear, your mobile devices, and much more. The same is true for a home without power during a major outage or natural disaster, where you may need to power air conditioning and major appliances. The EcoFlow DELTA Pro can help you weather the storm because it's a full-featured and smart portable power station.
Mobile Now that we're apart more often than we're together, smartphone battery life has taken on new importance. If your smartphone's battery dies, your ability to communicate with friends and family -- and therefore your social life -- goes with it, or at least is paused until you can recharge your phone. Pick up a charging case or a power bank and you can ensure your phone battery never dies -- and keep your social life on course too.
Of course, charging cases and power banks may not always operate exactly as their specs or marketing would suggest. While a typical power bank or charging case might come with an advertised capacity of 20,000mAh, this doesn't mean that it can recharge your Motorola Edge Plus or Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra exactly four times. In practice, its real (i.e., transferrable) capacity is likely to be around two-thirds of this, meaning that it can recharge a smartphone with a 5,000mAh battery only twice (or two and a half times) before needing a charge itself.
