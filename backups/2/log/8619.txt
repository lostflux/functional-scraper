We’re all on our screens these days, rarely holding a book in our hands, let alone a brochure or catalogue. Now everyone can have the best of both worlds with a flipbook: a digital e-book with pages that can be flipped and turned as if it were a paper book or collateral. Since more and more flipbooks can be found online how do you turn a PDF into your own professional-looking digital flyer or book? With My Flipbook software.
My Flipbook is one of the best tools available, designed to let you convert PDF documents into a browsable flipbook in just one click.
Simply install the program on your PC (Windows) and import your PDF file. Then click on the “ Build” button and the flipbook will automatically be generated. Before exporting you can customize it by inserting your logo, background image, title and description.
Image used with permission by copyright holder Any links in the original PDF will be preserved and included in the output flipbook. It’s also possible to embed YouTube videos, or manually add other links.
Unlike similar software, My Flipbook is the only one capable of creating flipbooks in a single file (.html), which can be easily shared both online and offline mode: send your flipbook via e-mail, insert onto your website or share via an external storage device such as a USB stick. You can also publish it directly online on the Myflipbook.net server (if you don’t have your own website).
The output of your new flipbook will be in HTML5 format , making it 100% responsive and compatible with any device.
My Flipbook offers advanced options that let you add password protection, activate a search form, or enable the download button to save the original PDF from the flipbook. Once you’re ready to build your flipbook you can set the “quality” by choosing the output resolution.
 You can also select from the many background images already loaded into the software.

Download and try the free version or create unlimited and watermark-free flipbooks with the PRO version for just only $49 per year. For added online storage of your flipbooks opt for the $69 per year Hosting plan.
Trust in My Flipbook, from the renowned FlipbookPDF.net family of online flipbook makers and developers.
