From its humble beginnings in 1977’s surprise hit Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope through countless prequels, sequels, and spin-off projects in television, film, literature, and games, the franchise changed Hollywood and sci-fi forever. Disney acquired Lucasfilm and the Star Wars franchise in 2012, and it has since expanded into myriad projects in development across TV, film, and other media, including the new Disney+ streaming service — and of course, Baby Yoda.
