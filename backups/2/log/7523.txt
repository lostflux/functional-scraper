Why trust us? Hulu Free Trial: Stream for a month without paying a dime By Jennifer Allen Close It’s really hard to choose just one or two streaming services, especially with everything that’s available now. It seems like so many platforms are offering exclusive content on top of other shows and movies that are worth watching — maybe even binging. That’s certainly the case with Hulu. But if you’re not already an active subscriber, you might be looking to give it a try before spending any money. If that describes you, and you’ve been searching for a Hulu free trial, we’re here to help. We’ve got everything you need to know about getting a Hulu free trial, plus we look at if there are other ways to get the streaming service for free and what Hulu deals are worth checking out. Just remember, if you want to use any streaming service, Hulu included, you’ll need a streaming device, so it might be worth checking out the best Roku deals too. Nevertheless, keep on reading while we guide you through everything you need to know about getting Hulu for less.
Is there a Hulu free trial? Can you get Hulu for free? Are there any Hulu deals? Is there a Hulu free trial? Phil Nickinson/Digital Trends Yes, there’s a Hulu free trial! Right now, you can get one month free on either the Hulu (ad-supported) plan or the no-ads plan. If you’re only planning on sticking around with Hulu for a month, you may as well sign up for the no-ads plan to save any interruptions. You’ll need to hand over your credit card details but you won’t be charged until the date that the one-month trial runs out. However, much like how there’s no Disney Plus free trial , there’s no Hulu with Live TV free trial.
Can you get Hulu for free? The Hulu free trial is the simplest way to get Hulu for free, but there are alternatives if you’re looking to have the service for longer than just a month. One solution is to have a Spotify Premium Student account which means you can also get Hulu (with ads) for free alongside it. You’ll need to be a student to be eligible but it’s a good way of saving big if you’re at school. Alternatively, if you’re a Sprint customer, select plans lets you enjoy the best Hulu original series for free.
Alternatively, you might consider some of the other services with offers, like the Showtime free trial , Amazon Prime Video free trial , the Sling TV free trial , or even the Netflix free trial.
 They’re certainly not the same as Hulu, but they offer plenty of content to hold you over until you can secure a subscription! Are there any Hulu deals? Phil Nickinson/Digital Trends When signing up to Hulu, you have a few different options. If you’re fine with ads, you can stick with Hulu (ad-supported) for $8 per month or $80 for the year. If you hate being interrupted while watching the best movies on Hulu , go for the ad-free Hulu for $18 per month.
However, there’s a better Hulu plan for most people — the Disney Bundle. For $15 per month, you can sign up to Hulu, Disney Plus , and ESPN+ saving you 44% off the usual price of subscribing separately. You can’t pay annually on this one, but with this kind of saving, it’s a great value. If you’d prefer no ads, you can pay $25 per month for Hulu with no ads and the other two services. If you can afford the extra, go for the Disney Bundle plan. If you don’t want all three, there are duo bundle options with just Disney+ and Hulu starting at $10 per month with ads.
Editors' Recommendations Netflix free trial: Can you stream for free in 2023? ESPN+ Free Trial: Can you sign up for free in 2023? Discovery Plus Free Trial: Stream for a week for free Amazon Prime Video Free Trial: Stream for a month for free HBO Max Free Trial: Can you stream hit shows for free? Deals Cheapest Prices Free Trial Deals If you're interested in watching some of the greatest live fights online or some boxing for free, you've come to the right place. What we do know is that DAZN is an excellent place to tune in. Founded in 2015, DAZN is now one of the top combat sports streaming platforms. When it first launched, DAZN was available only in four countries -- Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and Japan -- but has since grown to compete with the likes of ESPN+. DAZN now serves more than 200 regions around the globe, delivering live and on-demand boxing content, including fights, documentaries, news, interviews, analysis, and an archive of more than three decades' worth of classic bouts. Truthfully, it's one of the best places to go these days for live fights. If you're thinking about signing up and heard something about a DAZN free trial, we've got all the up-to-date details right here.
Is there a DAZN free trial? Deals Today, every network and every service has a streaming app to offer, and it seems silly to pay for a subscription to all of them without knowing how often you're going to use each one. So, the best way to break in some of the best streaming devices is with a free trial that lets you test out the library and experience. If you're wondering what to watch right now, AMC Plus is chock full of excellent content. You may recognize AMC as the network that brought us Breaking Bad, Mad Men, The Walking Dead, and Better Call Saul, among others, and AMC Plus is their relatively new streaming platform. An AMC Plus free trial is a great way to binge-watch some of your favorite AMC content and explore whether or not the popular streaming service is something you’d like to have access to more frequently with a paid subscription. On-demand AMC content is nothing to sneeze at -- they have some truly amazing shows. Don't forget, you can also check out some of the other streaming services that are out there, too. However, if AMC Plus still has you intrigued, read on.
Is there an AMC Plus free trial? An AMC Plus free trial does exist, and like a Disney Plus free trial, it’s good for seven days of access to the entire library of content. AMC Plus’ content includes favorites like The Walking Dead, Dark Winds, and Moonhaven. It also gives you access to thousands of hours of incredible movies, ready to watch whenever you are. An AMC Plus free trial also gets you seven days of access to the best content BBC America, IFC, and Sundance TV have to offer and full access to Shudder, Sundance Now, and IFC Films Unlimited.
Entertainment Unfortunately, there is not a Disney Plus free trial right now. Disney hasn't offered one for a few years. However, you can currently get the ad-supported version of Disney Plus for just $2. Disney is offering a special discount that gets you three months of the service for $2 per month. The service is normally $8 per month, so you'll save $24 total by the end of your three month subscription. This offer is only available until September 20, 2023.
Another way to save is through the Disney Bundle, which sees ESPN Plus and Hulu thrown in for just $13 a month. On their own, Disney Plus is normally $8 per month, Hulu is $8, and ESPN is $10, so this is a great deal. If it sounds good to you, you should start your subscription now. The price of the Disney Bundle is increasing to $15 on October 12, 2023.
