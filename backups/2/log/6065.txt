Digital Trends reached out to Sega after some miscommunication around the game’s frame rates during our preview period.
 On Monday, the company confirmed the correct frame rates for each console/platform, as well as the performance specs that come with them, so that you can determine which speed is right for you.
The results are about what you’d expect. The game can hit 60 fps on current gen consoles, but will cap at 30 on older hardware. The official frame rates for Sonic Frontiers are as follows.
PS5: Performance Mode = 1080p at up to 60 fps/Resolution Mode = Up to 4K dynamic resolution at 30 fps PS4: Dynamic resolution up to 1080p at 30 fps Xbox Series X/S: Performance Mode = 1080p at up to 60 fps/Resolution Mode = Up to 4K dynamic resolution at 30 fps Xbox One: Dynamic resolution up to 1080p at 30 fps Nintendo Switch: Dynamic resolution up to 720p at 30 fps (both handheld and docked) Steam: Dynamic resolution up to 4K at 60 fps (depending on individual PC specs) If you want to have the optimal gameplay experience of exploring the Starfall Islands with Sonic, 60 fps is your best bet. However, if you need to take things a little slower, or if you simply don’t have the PS5 nor Xbox Series X /S, 30 fps may be more your speed.
Sonic Frontiers is getting a free update this week, including new modes Even while moving forward, Sonic Frontiers never forgets the series’ past Sonic Frontiers beginner’s guide: 5 tips and tricks to get started Sonic Frontiers will be available on November 8 on PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Steam.
Editors' Recommendations The next great Sonic the Hedgehog game may be hiding on Apple Arcade Sonic Frontiers is getting new playable characters and story content next year The best skills in Sonic Frontiers After playing 6 hours of Sonic Frontiers, I’m sold on the ‘open zone’ pivot Sonic Frontiers and Monster Hunter cross over with free DLC Tech News Gaming Back in May, I wrote about how Sonic Frontiers miraculously avoided the controversial Sonic Cycle by keeping updates dry between its first teaser trailer and its official announcement trailer at The Game Awards last year. Now the game is less than two months away from release, and with the reveal of four more trailers, two alternative rock songs taking us back to 2007 (Vandalize by One OK Rock and I'm Here by To Octavia's Merry Kirk-Holmes), and Super Sonic making his triumphant return at the Tokyo Game Show, Sega seems confident that it will be a big deal for the franchise. Hell, I'm feeling more confident about this game than I ever felt for some of its predecessors. And that's saying something.
In fact, Sega is so sure about Sonic Frontiers that it's pricing the game at $60 -- or in the case of the Digital Deluxe Edition, $70 -- and putting it in direct competition with God of War: Ragnarok and Pokemon Scarlet and Violet in November. It's a big gamble to go all in on, but also a sore point for some Sonic fans. Most current-gen AAA games are priced between $60 and $70 due to enhanced graphics, controls, and the engines they run on, but some have balked at Frontiers’ price tag not only because it's "too expensive," but because they can't remember the last time a Sonic game cost that much.
Gaming During Gamescom, fans shared footage of the Cyberspace levels in Sonic Frontiers that featured similarities to levels from previous Sonic titles, such as the Windmill Isle in Sonic Unleashed. Now, Takashi Iizuka, head of Sonic Team, has confirmed that the similarities between Cyberspace and those classic levels are intentional.
In an interview with Eurogamer, Iizuka said that the Cyberspace levels are "digital expressions of the worlds in the memories of Sonic the Hedgehog." In other words, they're recreations of the memories of places that Sonic visited throughout his 30-year history, such as Green Hill Zone from Sonic the Hedgehog, Sky Sanctuary in Sonic 3, and even Radical Highway from Sonic Adventure 2. He even noted that some of those levels may get mixed together, as the Green Hill Zone Cyberspace level has the same level design as the Windmill Isle tutorial level from Unleashed.
Gaming Sega announced that Sonic Frontiers will be making its way to consoles and PC on November 8. Sega revealed the release date at Gamescom Opening Night Live on Tuesday alongside a new cinematic trailer for the game.
