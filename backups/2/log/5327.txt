Why trust us? Dell’s Inspiron 16 Plus lacks what creators want the most By Mark Coppock Close $1,450.00 Excellent productivity performance Competent creativity performance Very good productivity display Lightweight for its size Build has some flexing and bending Not competitively priced No display option for creators I’ve reviewed a few 16-inch laptops lately, which should come as no surprise. With the rise of creators as an important class of laptop users, manufacturers are focusing on providing large, fast laptops that meet photo editing and video editing needs. While premium laptops have dominated that new breed, a few less expensive machines have made their way to the market. The Dell Inspiron 16 Plus is one example, offering fast CPUs, discrete GPUs, and large displays that should make creative work more productive.
Specs and configurations A design that doesn’t fit the price Competitive performance, unpredictable battery life The display’s not for creators, and there’s no better option A decent laptop that just falls short But the Inspiron tends to represent Dell’s budget and midrange lineup, so putting a premium price on the Inspiron 16 Plus means it has to deliver. And it does when it comes to performance, but its design doesn’t live up to its price. It’s not a bad laptop, but there are some better options.
Which is better: Dell Latitude or Inspiron? Yet another disappointment about Intel’s next chips may be true Why the latest ThinkPad X1 Yoga Gen 8 isn’t worth the upgrade Correction : We originally reported that the Inspiron 16 Plus was constructed of all plastic, going off of some confusing information in the reviewer’s guide. In fact, the laptop has an external aluminum shell covering its sustainable internal plastic components.
Specs and configurations Dell Inspiron 16 Plus Dimensions 14.05 inches x 9.92 inches x 0.67-0.79 inches Weight 4.54 pounds Processor Intel Core i7-13620H Intel Core i7-13700H Graphics Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050 Nvidia GeForce RTX 4050 Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 RAM 8GB DDR5 (RTX 4060) 16GB LPDDR5 16GB DDR5 (RTX 4060) 32GB LPDDR5 32GB DDR5 (RTX 4060) 64GB DDR5 (RTX 4060) Display 16.0-inch 16:10 FHD+ (1,920 x 1,200) IPS, 60Hz 16.0-inch 16:10 2.5K (2,560 x 1,600) IPS, 120Hz Storage 256GB SSD 512GB SSD 1TB SSD 2TB SSD Touch No Ports 1 x USB-C with Thunderbolt 4 2 x USB-A 3.2 Gen 1 1 x HDMI 2.0 1 x 3.5mm audio jack 1 x SD card reader 1 x microSD card reader (RTX 4060) Wireless Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.2 Webcam 1080p Operating system Windows 11 Battery 86 watt-hour Price $1,450 The available configurations of the Inspiron 16 Plus are limited on Dell’s website, with few RAM and storage options. As I’m writing this review, the laptop starts at $1,200 for a Core i7-13620H CPU, 16GB of RAM , a 1TB SSD, Intel UHD graphics, and a 16-inch 16:10 2.5K IPS display. The most you’ll spend is $1,850 for a Core i7-13620H, 32GBof RAM , a 2TB SSD, an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 GPU, and the same display. Oddly enough, my review configuration costs $1,450 with a Core i7-13700H, 32GB of RAM , a 1TB SSD, and an RTX 4060. Yes, that’s right, choose a (slightly) faster CPU and half the storage and save $400.
The price places the Inspiron 16 Plus in direct competition with the HP Envy 16 , which costs $1,735 for the same configuration as my review unit. The HP costs more, but as we’ll see, it has some advantages over the Inspiron 16 Plus that deserve some consideration.
Note that when you configure the Inspiron 16 Plus, your choice of GPU will affect how much RAM you can configure and how fast it is. Only the RTX 4060 can equip up to 64GB of faster DDR5 RAM (theoretically, at least, since it’s not yet an option for purchase).
A design that doesn’t fit the price Mark Coppock / Digital Trends For a laptop with a price that pushes into premium territory, the Inspiron 16 Plus falls a bit short in its design. That begins with rigidity, which falls short of what you typically find in laptops costing well over $1,000. While the laptop boasts an aluminum exterior shell and its bottom chassis and keyboard deck are firm enough, the lid gives in to light pressure and there’s some distortion in the display. The slightly more expensive HP Envy 16 has a more rigid all-metal build and gives off a higher-quality feel. The Dell is also plainer in appearance, which again isn’t a bad thing when minimalist designs are increasingly the norm. Even so, the Envy 16 is more attractive.
The Inspiron and Envy are almost identical in their dimensions, with similarly sized display bezels (the Dell’s bezels are plastic, which contributes to the lower-end feel). The Inspiron 16 Plus is lighter, though, at 4.54 pounds versus 5.12 pounds.
Mark Coppock / Digital Trends I wasn’t terribly fond of the Inspiron 16 Plus’ keyboard, which felt a bit loose to me. It has deep enough travel and plenty of key spacing, but I prefer the snappier keyboard on the HP Envy 16. Certainly, it’s quite a bit behind the best keyboards on Dell’s XPS machines and Apple’s MacBooks. The touchpad was smaller than it could have been, with plenty of available palm rest space for a larger version, but it was responsive and its buttons were precise and not too loud.
A mix of Thunderbolt 4 and legacy ports make for good connectivity. I’d like to have seen one more of the former, and for some reason, the RTX 4060 version comes with a miniSD card reader rather than the full-size reader on the other models. Wireless connectivity is fully up to date.
Finally, the webcam runs at 1080p and provides a good image for videoconferencing. There’s no infrared camera for Windows 11 Hello facial recognition, but the fingerprint reader embedded in the power button worked fine. There’s a physical shutter for the webcam for some privacy.
Competitive performance, unpredictable battery life Mark Coppock / Digital Trends I reviewed the Inspiron 16 Plus with the fastest available components: a 45-watt Intel Core i7-13700H with 14 cores (six Performance and eight Efficient running at up to 5GHz) and 20 threads. It’s a common workhorse CPU for 16-inch laptops and promises solid performance. The Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 in my review unit also promises good performance in creative apps.
In our CPU-intensive benchmarks, the Inspiron 16 Plus performed as expected in all but the Cinebench R23 benchmark, where it fell slightly behind the Dell XPS 15 with the same chip. In the Pugetbench Premiere Pro benchmark, which runs in a live version of Adobe’s Premiere Pro and uses the GPU to speed up various processes, the Inspiron 16 Plus lagged the Dell XPS 15 , but was competitive with the MSI Prestige 16 Studio.
 The HP Envy 16 was a lot faster, but it also benefitted from a more powerful CPU in a much more expensive configuration.
Mark Coppock / Digital Trends Overall, the Inspiron 16 Plus performs well for a midrange 16-inch laptop. It will power through demanding productivity workflows while meeting the needs of most creators. One downside is heat; the Inspiron 16 Plus got very hot during benchmark runs, on the top of the palm rest and on the underside of the chassis. And that’s with the (sometimes annoying) fans running at full blast.

And of course, the HP equipped a faster CPU, making the Dell’s performance in Civilization VI that much more impressive. It was also faster than the Dell XPS 15 with the RTX 4070, but Dell significantly underclocked the GPU in that machine.
You’ll get solid 1080p gaming out of the Inspiron 16 Plus and can stretch that to 1440p if you turn down the graphical detail.

There are exceptions, such as the Dell XPS 15 with its decent longevity and the Apple MacBook Pro 16 that lasts forever on a charge. But if you can make it to lunch, you’re hitting the average for this class of devices.
The Inspiron 16 Plus was hard to gauge. First, it lasted longer in our web-browsing test than it did in our video-looping test, which is unusual. And it wouldn’t complete the PCMark 10 Applications battery test that’s the best measure of productivity longevity. Going by the numbers we have, I’d say battery life is just OK, and it won’t come close to lasting a full day on a charge.

The Full HD+ IPS panel at 60Hz isn’t available yet, but will theoretically lower the price. My review unit was equipped with the high-end display, a 2.5K IPS display running at a speedy 120Hz.
According to my colorimeter, the Dell panel wasn’t as bright as the HP Envy 16’s display with the same specs, but it offered a significantly higher contrast ratio and just slightly wider colors. Both displays had excellent color accuracy close to the DeltaE of 1.0 that means color differences can’t be viewed by the human eye.
That makes the Inspiron 16 Plus’ display very good for productivity users but without the wide color gamuts demanded by creators. The problem is that there’s no better option, while the Envy 16 has a 2.8K OLED display available that is likely to offer extremely wide colors. You’ll spend more for that option, but at least it’s available.

The sound was crisp and clear at full volume, with nice highs and mids, but almost no bass. The biggest problem is that the audio just didn’t get very loud. It’s fine for the occasional YouTube video and such, but if you want to enjoy your streaming media and music, you’ll want to plug in a good pair of headphones.
A decent laptop that just falls short The Inspiron 16 Plus falls just short of being a laptop that I can comfortably recommend. It provides good performance for all but the most demanding creators, but it doesn’t offer a display option that meets their needs. It’s priced like a premium laptop, but it’s not built like one. You expect a metal chassis and lid to be more rigid in a laptop costing $1,500 or more. And the battery life was erratic.
If you’re a productivity user who wants a really fast laptop, then it’s an option. But so are many other 16-inch machines. The HP Envy 16 is close in price with a similar configuration, but it feels like a more premium laptop. In the end, I’d say to pass on this one unless its price comes down considerably.
Editors' Recommendations Does Dell or HP make the best 16-inch laptop? You might be surprised Why the Dell XPS 13 Plus still beats the latest competition in little laptops The ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 11 is both faster and longer-lasting The best Dell laptops for 2023: XPS, Inspiron, and more The best fanless laptops in 2023 Dell Laptop Reviews Laptops Product Reviews Windows Reviews Computing Intel is bringing the Xe Super Sampling (XeSS) upscaling feature to its integrated graphics, including its upcoming 13th-gen mobile processors. At CES 2023, the company announced that the integrated graphics on 11th-gen through 13th-gen processors will receive a slew of graphics features, including a greater than 30% jump in gaming performance thanks to XeSS in supported games -- at least according to Intel.
If you're unfamiliar, XeSS is Intel's challenger to Nvidia's Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS). It works by rendering your game at a lower resolution and then upscaling it with AI, improving your frame rate in the process. XeSS isn't quite as good as DLSS, but it still provides huge performance boosts in games like Hitman 3 and Shadow of the Tomb Raider based on our testing.
Computing Intel is pushing laptop CPU core counts to places they've never been before. The company announced its 13th-gen Raptor Lake mobile processors at CES 2023, including the flagship Core i9-13980HX which includes a massive 24 cores that could top the list of the best Intel processors.
That sounds insane considering even AMD's desktop Ryzen 9 7950X only comes with 16 cores. But Intel's cores aren't all built equally. Like the previous generation, 13th-gen mobile Raptor Lake processors include a combination of performance (P) cores and efficient (E) cores. The most powerful chips in the range come with 24 cores, but they're split across eight P-cores and 16 E-cores.
Computing Raptor Lake is Intel's 13th generation of processors, and it's one of the most exciting hardware launches of the year. Following up on the momentum it built with its Alder Lake line of CPUs, Intel is looking to retain some of the hard-fought performance crowns. It's got new and stiffer competition, though, in the form of AMD's Ryzen 7000 series of Zen 4 CPUs, which have already impressed for their efficiency and performance.
How will these new CPU lines fair when going head to head? Here's everything you need to know about Raptor Lake.
