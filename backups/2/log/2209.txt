Why trust us? The best PS4 games for 2023 By Gabe Gurwin and Joseph Yaden Close The PlayStation 4 sits comfortably atop the throne as one of the last generation’s best consoles. It’s the bestselling platform of the lot, with its early success being pinned mostly to its solid exclusive titles and aggressively timed DLC deals in the face of the competition. As of 2022, the PS4 has shipped more than 117 million units worldwide.
Things have evened out in recent years when it comes to exclusives, but throughout the generation, Sony’s wedge of a machine has built up a healthy catalog of games across every conceivable genre. Its successor, the PlayStation 5 , is backward-compatible with nearly every PS4 game, meaning you’ll likely find yourself coming back to games from the previous generation on your new machine. There is a cluster of PS5 games that won’t ever be coming to PS4 though.
Either way, here is our definitive list of the best PS4 games.
Save on everything from laptops and tablets, to coffee makers and air purifiers, and a whole host of Apple tech like iPad, Apple Watch and even the latest M3 MacBooks, as well as smart home essentials like the Amazon Echo and smart bulbs.
God of War Ragnarök PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5 Hack and slash/Beat 'em up, Adventure SIE Santa Monica Studio Sony Interactive Entertainment November 09, 2022 God of War Ragnarok may be positioned as a big PlayStation 5 game, but that doesn’t mean you can’t run it on PS4. In fact, quite the contrary. The sequel to 2018’s critically acclaimed God of War feels like it was built with Sony’s last console in mind first. It looks a bit cleaner, but largely uses some of the first game’s tech tricks to hide loading in clever ways. That means that God of War Ragnarok is one of the most high-end PS4 games you can grab right now, so there’s no need to wait for a PS5 to grab it.

That’s right, in Stray , you play as a feline tasked with escaping a desolate, cyberpunk city, while freeing a group of trapped robots in the process. While this game is a cat lover’s dream, it’s great for all players, partially because it’s so approachable. The main focus in Stray isn’t to stump you, but rather, to take you on a memorable journey, with light action, platforming, and puzzles sprinkled throughout. Its art is gorgeous, the music is fantastic, and its story will probably make you cry.

 Set in Sengoku-era Japan rather than a wholly original world, the game is nonetheless filled with magic and monsters ready to kill you at a moment’s notice. No enemy is too weak to deserve your attention, and many are formidable in one-on-one fights. The real meat of Sekiro , however, are the boss fights. They play out like choreographed dances, requiring you to learn a boss’s every move before you’re ready to go in for the kill. With the Posture system becoming more important in most fights than a standard health bar, you need to stay aggressive, but getting greedy will result in a swift death.

Monster Hunter: World modernizes a classic RPG and makes it easy for anyone to jump in. It features beautiful zones that feel alive, monsters with improved A.I., and really cool DLC crossovers with Final Fantasy, Street Fighter, and Horizon Zero Dawn.
 There’s also a multiplayer mode where up to four players can suit up in their best gear and take down dangerous beasts together. As one of the PlayStation 4’s bestselling games, you’d be missing out if you didn’t at least consider picking it up.

Whether you just need a basic device to better enjoy the audio of your favorite games or a premium one that will give you the communications advantage when battling with your teammates in online multiplayer matches, there's surely something for you out there. If you take advantage of the Black Friday PS5 deals or Black Friday Xbox Series S deals, you'll definitely want a headset to chat with your buds. Of course, to help you find that perfect offer, we've gathered our top picks below, and if something catches your eye, proceed with the transaction as soon as possible, as the deal may end sooner than you think.
Best Black Friday Wired Gaming Headset Deals There are various reasons why gamers prefer wired gaming headsets, including their relatively lower prices compared to wireless gaming headsets and generally better audio quality because their cables support higher bandwidth with less interference. They're also fantastic if you've grabbed one of the Black Friday Xbox Series X deals.
Gaming Gamers who need to replace their aging screens should take advantage of this year's Black Friday deals for a new gaming monitor, as there are discounts offered for displays made by some of the most trusted brands like Samsung, HP, Dell, and Lenovo. Among the most important things to consider for your purchase are size, resolution, and refresh rate -- and of course, if the price fits your budget. There's no shortage of options that you can find online from the different retailers, but you help you make a decision quickly, we've gathered our top picks below. We've organized these monitors by refresh rate. If you prioritize resolution, consider checking out the best 4K monitor Black Friday deals or 5K monitor Black Friday deals.
Best 165Hz gaming monitor Black Friday deals A monitor's refresh rate determines how often the images on the screen are updated -- the higher the refresh rate, the smoother your gameplay will be. A 165Hz refresh rate is just above our computer monitor buying guide's recommended range of 120Hz to 144Hz, and it's great for gamers on a budget as you'll still be getting proper support for your video games' higher frame rates. Size and resolution are other factors to consider though, so you should be going for the monitor that your budget allows.
Gaming If you're running out of storage space on your PS5, don't miss the discounts that you can get from Black Friday deals for an internal SSD for the console. The original PlayStation 5 comes with a 825GB hard drive but only 667GB is usable, while the new model features a 1TB hard drive with about 842GB that's usable. That may look like a lot, but with the space that the best PS5 games take plus all your save data and screenshots, that much storage will get used up quickly. Fortunately, there are savings that you can pocket from buying a PS5 SSD during Black Friday from retailers like Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart, but as with all the other PS5 Black Friday deals happening now, you need to act fast because stocks may run out soon. If you like to switch between consoles or carry your save games on the go, consider browsing the best Black Friday external hard drive deals.
Best PS5 SSD Black Friday deal The WD_BLACK SN850X internal SSD, which was made for compatibility with the PlayStation 5, will add 1TB of extra storage space to the console, so you'll be able to install even more PS5 games. The internal SSD offers speeds of up to 7,300 MB/s, which will allow it to keep up with the performance of the console, and with the WD_BLACK Dashboard, you'll be able to monitor its health. It also comes with a built-in heatsink to make sure that it doesn't overheat even when you've been playing for hours. Right now, the 1TB WD_BLACK SN850X internal SSD, originally priced at $180, is down to just $85 from Amazon for Black Friday, for savings of $95.
