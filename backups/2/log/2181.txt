More More More More More More More More More More Joe Maring / Digital Trends Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra The best Android phone overall Incredibly powerful processor Versatile telephoto zoom camera S Pen adds value Water-resistant and durable Long software update commitment Many interesting features to explore Large, bright, detailed screen Wired charging is complicated, and only 45W Big and heavy Why you should buy this: It's an incredible smartphone that will last for years.
Who is it for?: Anyone who wants the very best Android phone money can buy.
Why we picked the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra : Samsung has been improving the Galaxy Ultra formula for the past few years, and it may have peaked with the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra. Samsung's biggest, newest flagship is a masterpiece of design, with a powerful processor, exceptional camera, beautiful display, and many more appealing features. While the price is high, it's a phone that's sure to serve you well — and last for years to come.
We'll start with the camera, as it's one of the standout features. The S23 Ultra has a quad-lens setup and features a huge 200-megapixel main lens, along with a 10MP 10x periscope telephoto lens, a standard 3x telephoto lens, and a 12MP ultrawide lens. The new camera suite is a game-changer, but not for the reasons you might initially expect. Images taken at 200MP are stunning, but they're also huge, coming in at a hefty 40MB per shot. Instead, it's the zoom that makes the S23 Ultra so special. The 3x and 10x zoom options remain great, but the 30x option is catching up in quality. The 100x option is still not the best, but it's advanced far past what it used to be. Put simply, the S23 Ultra takes zoomed photos that just aren't possible on other smartphones. Even if zoomed photos aren't really your thing, it's still an exceptional setup with a lot of versatility.
As befits a flagship phone, the S23 Ultra is also packing some powerful specs. We've already been impressed by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 in the OnePlus 11, but the Galaxy S23 Ultra takes it to a whole other level. Despite pushing it with the most demanding tasks we could find, we don't think we even came close to the S23 Ultra's upper limit. There was very little heating from demanding games, and lag between tasks was nonexistent. The available storage starts at 256GB, and while that's a good amount for a modern flagship, consider upgrading if you want to regularly take 8K videos or 200MP images, as both take up a lot of space.
As with the previous S22 Ultra, the S23 Ultra comes with an S Pen, like the Note smartphones of old, and there's plenty you can do with this — from jotting down notes on the screen to quickly creating gifs from videos. The battery lasts a full day, and while the 45W charging isn't the fastest around, it's still good enough for most and recharges the battery quickly. On the subject of downsides, also keep in mind that this phone really fits the "ultra" tag. It's massive, and really quite heavy as well, so it's definitely not for those who want a smaller device.
There's so much we haven't touched on, like the gorgeous design and sublime display, but suffice it to say they're excellent. The Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra is certainly an expensive phone, but it's one that will definitely last you for years, and a good investment if you want a phone that's sure to last the distance.
Joe Maring / Digital Trends Google Pixel 8 Pro The best Android phone runner-up Google's best phone design yet Lovely, vibrant display Phenomenal cameras Unbelievable photo-editing tools Face Unlock is magical Tensor G3 is a big improvement Seven years of updates! The temperature sensor Mediocre battery life Slow charging speeds Why you should buy this: This is the best Android phone not owned by Samsung, case closed.
Who it's for: It's for anyone who wants an Android phone, but forever reason doesn't want one from Samsung.
Why we picked the Google Pixel 8 Pro : We described the Google Pixel 8 Pro as the best Pixel we’ve ever used, and for good reason. This new smartphone boasts exciting features, such as improved cameras and photo-editing tools, Google's latest Tensor chip, and more.
Let’s discuss the design of the Pixel 8 Pro. Despite closely resembling the Google Pixel 7 Pro , Google has made significant changes to the device. This year, the rear glass features an impressive, smooth matte finish. The phone’s rounded corners have also been increased, making it more comfortable to hold. Additionally, the dual camera cutouts found on the Pixel 7 Pro have been replaced with a single cutout that spans the length of the camera bar.
The display on the Pixel 8 Pro has also seen some nice upgrades. The 120Hz refresh rate has been tweaked so that it can scale down to 1Hz, not 10Hz, as needed. This means less energy gets used. The display is also much brighter, rising to 1,600 nits for HDR and 2,400 for peak brightness.
The primary camera on the Pixel 8 Pro has a resolution of 50 megapixels and an aperture of f/1.68, which makes it more light-sensitive. Additionally, it has a 2x optical zoom. The new ultrawide camera has a resolution of 48MP and an f/1.95 aperture, significantly improving its light sensitivity and macro mode. Also, the telephoto camera has a resolution of 48MP, an f/2.8 aperture, and a 5x optical zoom, resulting in improved light sensitivity. Furthermore, the front-facing camera has an f/2.2 aperture and autofocus support.
The Pixel 8 Pro has new camera software tools that are pretty impressive. One is Best Take, which is heavily advertised in Google’s latest television ads. This feature automatically stitches together multiple photographs so everyone in the shot appears smiling. Additionally, a Magic Editor feature allows you to erase and move objects from existing photos, even those not taken with the Pixel 8 Pro.
The Pixel 8 Pro has a new Tensor G3 chip , which has been well received. The previous versions didn’t perform well, so this one had much to prove. The Tensor G3 chip can handle various tasks such as gaming, live video streaming over a 5G connection, and capturing photos. The best part is that the Tensor G3 chip doesn’t overheat like its predecessors.
Simply put, the Google Pixel 8 Pro is a standout Android phone that has earned its place as our best runner-up for many reasons. Not only does it boast a stunning design that is sure to impress, but it also features an improved camera system that delivers stunning photos and videos. With its large and vibrant display, lightning-fast processor, and long-lasting battery life, the Pixel 8 Pro is a true workhorse that can keep up with even the most demanding users. Whether you’re a professional photographer or someone who wants a reliable and powerful smartphone, the Pixel 8 Pro is worth considering.
More Joe Maring/Digital Trends OnePlus 11 The best big Android phone Eye-catching design Two-day battery life 25 minute battery charging Characterful camera Long software update commitment No wireless charging Portrait camera disappoints Why you should buy this: The OnePlus 11 delivers great specs and features for less money than the S23 Ultra.
Who it's for: Anyone who wants a quality Android phone that's not prohibitively expensive that's also big.
Why we picked the OnePlus 11 : While the Galaxy S23 Ultra may be the best Android phone overall, the OnePlus 11 is a close runner-up. It all starts with the OnePlus 11's hardware. A combination of a stainless steel frame and glass back results in a phone that feels wonderful to hold. The rear camera housing takes some getting used to, but it's bold, distinct, and stands out from the crowd. The best part? After removing it from the OnePlus 10T, the OnePlus 11 brings back the alert slider — and it's just as great as ever.
The OnePlus 11 boasts not only a stylish look but also incredibly capable specifications. The phone's 6.7-inch AMOLED display is delightful to look at, with a 120Hz refresh rate that adds to the smoothness of every action you take. This is due in part to the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chipset that powers the phone, which is extremely fast and handles every app or game with ease. Additionally, the phone has good thermals and excellent power efficiency, allowing you to use it for up to two days per charge. When the battery does run out, 80W charging allows you to charge your phone from 0% to 100% in just 30 minutes. The OnePlus 11 does not offer wireless charging, but the ultra-fast wired charging speeds help make up for it.
What about the camera? The 50MP main camera is the star of the show, producing sharp, detailed images with a unique style, thanks to OnePlus's ongoing Hasselblad partnership. It's a joy to use, while the 48MP ultra-wide camera is also good. However, the 32MP telephoto camera with its 2x optical zoom cannot compete with the zoom capabilities of other Android phones.
When using the OnePlus 11, you'll interact with OxygenOS 13. It's not as minimalistic as previous versions of OnePlus's software, but it's fast, fluid, and generally great to use. Even better, you're promised four major Android updates and five years of security patches. With a starting price of $699, the OnePlus 11 stands tall as one of the best Android phones in 2023.
More Christine Romero-Chan / Digital Trends Samsung Galaxy S23 The best small Android phone Sleek and compact design Comfortable for one-handed use Very fast performance Reliable cameras take great photos Long-lasting battery life Five years of guaranteed updates Base storage is still 128GB Fast charging up to only 25W Limited zoom quality past 10x Why you should buy this: It's almost everything we love about the S23 Ultra, in a smaller package.
Who is it for?: Anyone who wants a small, but exceedingly powerful smartphone.
Why we picked the Samsung Galaxy S23 : The Galaxy S23 Ultra is the best Android phone, but it's going to be a little large for a number of people. Instead, those people should look at the Samsung Galaxy S23, which offers a lot of what makes the Ultra model great, but in a smaller package.
The 6.1-inch display is as gorgeous as Samsung's usually are, and it's as bright as it is vivid. The slim bezels mean it's compact, despite the screen's size, and the edges are flat, rather than curved like on the S23 Ultra. The smaller size means it's much easier to use in a single hand, unlike many modern smartphones, and it's lightweight too. The S23 is a bit on the slippery side, though, so a Galaxy S23 case would be a good idea — just for grip's sake.
The Galaxy S23 comes with the same Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 for Galaxy processor as its bigger siblings, so it's just as powerful and stupendously fast as the rest of the range. Unfortunately, there's a slight downgrade where storage options are concerned. The Galaxy S23 starts with 128GB of storage, compared to 256GB on the Ultra. 128GB is still a good amount of storage, but it's not really going to cut it if you take advantage of the S23's ability to shoot 8K video.
You'll want to take photos and videos with this phone, too. It has a triple-lens camera setup, comprised of a 50MP main lens, a 12MP ultrawide lens, and a 10MP telephoto lens with 3x optical zoom. While not as stunning as the Ultra's setup, it's still a great camera phone, producing lovely stills in a wide variety of circumstances. The zoom suffers due to the lower-spec telephoto lens, and it clearly can't match the S23 Ultra's improvements, but it's otherwise a great snapper — if you're okay with Samsung's usual oversaturation of colors in post-processing.
Battery life is excellent; we averaged about two days on a single charge, though that was without text messages or phone call use, so if you're particularly heavy on those, you may last closer to a single day. Recharging is less impressive, with the phone topping out at 25W. That'll give you a 50% charge in about 30 minutes, which is good, but there are much faster charging phones available, including the OnePlus 11 above.
Prices start from just $799, and the 256GB upgrade is available for just $60 extra, which is a worthwhile investment in our opinion. The Samsung Galaxy S23 is easily the best Android smartphone to buy right now if you're looking for a smaller phone, and a great phone in its own right as well.
More Andy Boxall / Digital Trends Google Pixel 8 The best value Android phone Great main camera Amazing AI photo editing tools Two-day battery life Slick, fast Android 14 Tensor G3 is cool and efficient Seven years software support Wide-angle camera disappoints Average charge speed Why you should buy this: What's not to like? This is a terrific Pixel that might even be better than the Pixel 8 Pro.
Who it's for: It's for anyone who wants a cutting edge Pixel for less money.
Why we picked the Google Pixel 8 : The Google Pixel 8 smartphone has impressed many people, including us. It's hard not to ask, "Why wouldn't you want the Pixel 8?" when considering its many features. One of the first things that catches your attention is its improved design. It's more compact, lighter, and better looking than its predecessors. The phone is easy to hold and use with one hand, making it an excellent option for people who are always on the go.
Another feature that stands out is the battery life. The Pixel 8 has a battery that lasts up to two days with general use, even when connected to a smartwatch. This is impressive, considering how much we rely on our phones nowadays. You don't need to worry about running out of battery when you're out and about.
The camera is another highlight of the Pixel 8. It takes incredible photos, and the AI editing features are unmatched.
 With this phone, you don’t need to be a professional photographer to take great pictures. The AI helps you capture and edit the best shots to make them look even better. You can create stunning photos with just a few taps on the screen.
What's more, the brilliant software will be updated until 2030. This means that you won't need to upgrade your phone anytime soon. You'll have the latest software and security patches for years to come.
All these features come for $699, which is quite reasonable considering what you're getting. However, if you're looking for something even more advanced, you might want to consider the Pixel 8 Pro. It costs $999 but offers a more advanced camera and screen. It also comes with a more significant number of AI features to come in future updates. However, the more modestly specced Pixel 8's longer battery life is a reason to consider your priorities when choosing between these two phones.
When two brand-new phones are released, it's easy to assume that the best thing to do is buy the Pro or the more expensive model. However, Google has done a great job ensuring that the Pixel 8's specifications, performance, and abilities are top-notch. You don't need to spend more money to get a great phone.
More Andy Boxall/Digital Trends Samsung Galaxy A54 The best midrange Android phone Eye-catching colors It looks like the Galaxy S23 Colorful screen Speakers sound good Long software commitment Battery doesn't last two days No wireless charging Camera lacks realism Why you should buy this: It's a colorful mid-range phone that doesn't disappoint.
Who it's for: Someone who wants a good mid-tier (or very colorful) smartphone.
Why we picked the Samsung Galaxy A54 : No, we haven't accidentally listed one of the Galaxy S23's colorways, that's actually the Galaxy A54. Samsung's new midrange phone is a dead ringer for its flagship, and that's a very good thing. In fact, the A54's design differs from its more expensive cousin in just a few ways, and the most important is the range of bold colors. The Violet and Lime variants have a lot of character, and they're well worth picking over the more standard black or white versions. The chassis is made from plastic instead of the S23's aluminum, but it's covered in Gorilla Glass 5, so it still feels like a premium product.
The Galaxy A54 has a 6.4-inch Super AMOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate, HDR10+ certification, and a 1080p resolution, which largely puts it on a level with the A53 5G's excellent display. The A54's display is brighter than its predecessor though, giving it an edge under strong lights and outdoors.
It's powered by the Exynos 1380, a Samsung-made chip that does a good job of keeping everything running. It might start to show its age as this phone ages, though, especially if you're a mobile gamer. While never slow, sometimes we did experience some slight lag in opening apps, especially the camera. The internal storage options of 128GB and 256GB are good, especially when there's room for a microSD card as well.
The camera is a solid affair, especially since it's ditched the A53's useless depth sensor. There's a 50MP main lens, combined with a 12MP wide-angle and 5MP macro lens, and it takes good pictures — with one, pretty jarring exception. The stills it produces are almost always enormously oversaturated, to the point where it can seem comically so. Samsung's phones have long been known for turning up the saturation a little too much, but it's the first time it's done so way too far, and it's a bit of a disappointment here.
Two-day battery life was starting to become the norm for Samsung's phones, but that's not the case here. You'll get only a single day out of this battery, and while that's acceptable, it's a little disappointing if you're used to much longer battery life.
The Samsung Galaxy A54 has some downsides, but ultimately, they're on the more minor side when compared with what you get: A capable smartphone that looks great, has a day-long battery life, and scores well in pretty much every area. Even if it doesn't excel, it doesn't need to, and the $450 price means it's a great choice for anyone looking for a mid-range phone.
More Christine Romero-Chan / Digital Trends Samsung Galaxy A14 5G The best cheap Android phone Only $200 Large display with a 90Hz refresh rate 5,000mAh battery 50MP rear camera, 13MP selfie camera Respectable performance Unique, textured back Secondary cameras aren't impressive No water or dust resistance Fast charging up to 15W only Why you should buy this: Because it's an incredibly good smartphone for the $200 price.
Who it's for: Anyone who wants a good phone for less than a quarter of the top flagships.
Why we picked the Samsung Galaxy A14 5G : There are $200 phones that really feel like $200 phones, but the Samsung Galaxy A14 5G isn't one of them. Samsung has done an incredible of keeping the A14 from feeling too cheap, and that starts with the design. Admittedly, it has a plastic body, but it has a unique texture that feels nice and offers grip, something often missing from slippery glass phones. There's no water resistance, but there is a headphone jack, which is a nice bonus.
The 6.6-inch LCD display has a 1080p resolution, but it's hampered by not getting bright enough. It also has some relatively chunky bezels. But even with that in mind, it's an impressive display for a $200 phone, thanks largely to the 90Hz refresh rate. While not as smooth as the same refresh rate you'll find in more powerful phones, this is still impressive in a phone this cheap, and a really strong point in its favor when you consider the iPhone 14 is still using a 60Hz refresh rate.
We did come across small stutters during use, and that's likely down to the relatively modest specs. Still, the Galaxy A14 5G has excellent performance when compared to other devices at this price point, and the 64GB of storage is also good enough at this price too. You'll want to clear out running apps to keep it running smoothly, but it also comes with 5G, meaning it should be futureproofed enough for the next few years at least. The battery is a solid two-day affair, thanks to the modest specs and 5,000mAh capacity. Recharging isn't particularly fast at just 15W, but when it lasts this long, it doesn't matter too much.
The camera is also surprisingly good. Ignore the two additional lenses, though, as they're 2MP and don't do much — instead, focus on the 50MP main lens, which takes some decent shots. Images are clear, bright, and avoid oversaturation. Nighttime shots are also good, though with some visible noise when zoomed in. They're all generally still good enough for social media, though, which is a big test for camera phones at this price.
The Samsung Galaxy A14 5G is a stellar phone for just $200, and if you're looking for a serious budget bargain, then you've found it.
More Joe Maring/Digital Trends / Digital Trends OnePlus Nord N30 5G The best cheap Android phone runner-up Nice in-hand feel Headphone jack and expandable storage 120Hz display looks great Good, reliable performance 50W charger in the box Bland, smudge-prone design Very poor camera quality Only promised a single OS update Why you should buy this: It's a solid, if flawed, cheap smartphone.
Who it's for: Someone who wants a good cheap phone, and doesn't care about camera performance.
Why we picked the OnePlus Nord N30 5G : Cheap phones sometimes struggle to excel in some areas without cutbacks in others, and the OnePlus Nord N30 5G is a prime example of this. OnePlus's latest $300 phone is great in a number of areas, but has some serious setbacks in others that may or may not impact whether you want to buy and use it.
We'll start by addressing the elephant in the room, and it's the camera. The Nord N30 has a triple lens rear camera setup, and while impressive on paper, the combination of a 108MP main lens, 2MP macro lens, and 2MP depth sensor don't deliver the goods. The 108MP lens lacks optical image stabilization so a lot of stills come out blurred. Low-light shots are blurred and noisy, while even images in good lighting tend to be bland and characterless. The 2MP macro lens is acceptable, but it can't rescue what is a poor overall showing.
Thankfully, other areas of the phone are a lot better. The design is a little boring, but it feels and handles very well. It's well weighted, meaning one-handed use is possible despite the large size, and it has a headphone jack and microSD card as well. The 6.72-inch LCD display is excellent, and has bright colors and a 1080p resolution. Most impressive though, is the refresh rate. The Nord N30 sports a 120Hz refresh rate, putting it on the level of flagship phones like the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra and Google Pixel 7 Pro.
It's no gaming phone , but performance is still good. The Snapdragon 695 can handle most modern games, even if you may need to drop graphical quality if you want to experience the higher refresh rates the display is capable of. Battery life is similarly strong, and you can expect over a day of use most of the time. The Nord N30 also supports up to 50W of super-fast charging too, making it one of the fastest charging phones at this price point.
Yes, the camera is a letdown — but that's only important if you're the sort of person who likes taking pictures and videos. If you're not much of a photographer, then there's a lot to appeal to you here. The OnePlus Nord N30 5G has an excellent display, good performance, and a great battery life, and is a solid phone for just $300.
More Andy Boxall/Digital Trends Nothing Phone 2 The best designed Android phone Great, modern design Glyph lights are cool and useful Clean, yet customizable software Excellent daytime camera Colorful screen Only IP54 water resistance Poor lowlight camera performance Why you should buy this: Because it's like nothing else on the market, and a good phone to boot.
Who it's for: Someone who wants a phone that really stands out from the usual crowd.
Why we picked the Nothing Phone 2 : Aside from folding phones, all smartphones are starting to look the same in terms of design. However, Carl Pei's Nothing has done something different with the Nothing Phone, and the latest Nothing Phone 2 continues to stand out from the crowd with the clear glass back and Glyph lighting system.
The Nothing Phone 2 is slightly bigger than its predecessor, coming in with a 6.7-inch OLED display, while the first phone had a 6.5-inch display. The 6.7-inch screen has 2412 x 1080 pixel resolution and a dynamic refresh rate up to 120Hz. Colors are bright and vivid on the display, everything looks crisp and sharp, and the speaker system is pretty decent for the price.
Even as a second generation device, the design for the Nothing Phone 2 is still unlike anything you've seen before. It's a glass slab, yes, but it feels very light and manageable, despite the large size. The flat edges are part of the aluminum chassis, the clear back is made of glass, and the front screen is covered with Gorilla Glass. The Glyph lighting on the back is still present, though the LED strips are broke up into more segments this time around. However, the glass back also makes the phone very slippery, so be careful.
The Glyph lighting is also improved over the first generation. As mentioned earlier, it's broken up into sections, giving it more functionality for various purposes. You can use the lighting as a visual timer, highlight priority notifications by having a persistent light, a fill-light for the camera in low light environments, and certain patterns can be set for incoming calls, accompanied by a sound effect. There's a lot of customization here with the lighting system, and it is one of the standout features of the Nothing Phone 2.
Camera-wise, there aren't a lot of change from the Nothing Phone 1. You have a 50MP main camera and a 50MP ultra wide. The selfie camera is 32MP. During the daytime, the Nothing Phone 2 will take some great photos. It struggles a bit in lowlight environments, but it's a very solid performer across the board.
The Nothing Phone 2 comes with Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 chip, which is a slightly older processor. However, it offers fantastic performance and efficiency, so the Nothing Phone 2 should handle anything you need it to with ease. You get Android 13 with Nothing OS 2.0 layered on top. It's similar to Android on a Pixel, though with some added customization features — including the ability to personalize folders and give all of your app icons a monochromatic paint job.
Battery life on the Nothing Phone 2 is also very good, as it has a 4,700mAh battery inside. Even with heavy use, you should be able to get through the day just fine without having to charge up mid-day. And when you do need to charge, it supports up to 45W PPS charging, which is a little under an hour for a full charge.
Considering the price, the Nothing Phone 2 is one of the best phones you can buy starting at $599. Not only is it one of the most unique looking smartphones around, but the day-to-day experience of using the phone is also rock solid. There's very little to seriously complain about.
Andy Boxall/Digital Trends Asus ROG Phone 7 Ultimate The best gaming Android phone ROG Vision screen is fun Amazing audio ability Vibrant screen under flat glass Gaming features are varied and useful Huge amounts of power Long battery life Big and bulky Lots of hidden features to uncover No wireless charging Why you should buy this: This is the best gaming smartphone available today.
Who it's for: Mobile gamers who take their gaming very seriously.
Why we picked the Asus ROG Phone 7 Ultimate : What makes a great gaming phone? If you replied with "power", then you're absolutely right — but that isn't the beginning and end of it, and delivering in a number of other areas is exactly what makes the Asus ROG Phone 7 Ultimate not just an incredible gaming phone, but also a great smartphone in its own right. This is the best gaming phone around, but also worth considering even if you aren't a serious mobile gamer.
We'll start with the obvious best place to start: the hardware. As you might expect, power is front-and-center, with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor continuing to be an exceptional chip for gaming. There's enough power here to blast through even the most demanding mobile games — and more than enough headroom for it to continue to provide strong performance for years to come. It's joined by 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage, so there's plenty of room for games, videos, and everything else.
You'll want those videos and games, too, as the ROG Phone 7 Ultimate looks and sounds amazing. The 6.78-inch display is a bespoke Samsung AMOLED screen with a 2448 x 1080 pixel resolution, 1,500 nits of brightness, and a variable refresh rate that tops out at 165Hz. Backing up the gaming power, it also has a 23-millisecond latency and 720Hz touch sampling. In short, it's bright, crisp, and looks and feels incredibly smooth.
The dual front-facing speakers sound amazing , with more bass and fullness than most other phones, with none of the tinny sound that's common in other smartphones. Even better, the AeroActive Cooler 7 accessory that comes with the phone also includes a subwoofer, giving it a 2.1 sound system. It's an incredible piece of handheld tech for games and movies alike, and it makes the ROG Phone 7 Ultimate the phone for film lovers as well as hardcore gamers.
It's a big phone, though, and that may make it more difficult to justify for many people. While the size, weight, and solid build mean it feels great while gaming, it sinks heavily into pockets and can be ungainly. However, the positioning of a USB-C port on the side means you can charge easily while playing, though you may not need to charge as much as you think, as the battery is excellent. The massive 6,000mAh battery dropped to just 70% after a day of light use, but even with six hours of screen use with GPS, gaming, and videos, it ended the day at 1 a.m. with 36% remaining. The camera isn't a stunner, but it's capable and certainly not a disappointment.
The Asus ROG Phone 7 Ultimate is very clearly a smartphone for those serious about mobile gaming, but it's also a strong choice for anyone who wants a unique-looking phone that excels at films and other multimedia as much as gaming. Unfortunately, it's not available in the U.S. yet, though you can import it. Prices are inflated past the RRP of about $1,533 right now, so it's worth waiting until prices fall to around that price. If you can get it for the right price, it's the ultimate gaming phone.
Christine Romero-Chan / Digital Trends Google Pixel 7a The best Android phone under $500 Most compact Pixel 7 device Water-resistant 64MP main camera 90Hz refresh rate Wireless charging Four fun colors Not great with low light photos Battery life is disappointing No reverse wireless charging Price puts it in an odd place Why you should buy this: You want a late model Google Pixel, but can't afford the Pixel 8 or Pixel 8 Pro.
Who it's for: Anyone in the market for a new handset that needs to keep the price tag under $500.
Why we picked the Google Pixel 7a : The Google Pixel 7a is a highly capable device that offers an exceptional value for its price, coming in at just $499. Although it is the smallest of the Pixel 7 series, the 6.1-inch display is nothing short of impressive. The vibrant colors, rich blacks, and 90Hz refresh rate make for an immersive viewing experience, making it ideal for scrolling and gaming.
The device runs on Android 13, powered by the Tensor G2 chip, which ensures that everything runs smoothly and responsively. With 8GB RAM, users can expect snappy performance, and multitasking is a breeze.
One of the standout features of the Pixel 7a is its camera. The device features a 64MP main camera and a 13MP ultrawide lens, which is impressive, to say the least. The Tensor G2 chip ensures that the camera app is fast and responsive, even when capturing photos of subjects in motion.
For the first time in the Pixel A-series, wireless charging is available. This means that users can charge their devices without worrying about cables or cords, making it a convenient feature for those who are always on the go.
However, it's worth noting that despite the impressive camera specs, the Pixel 7a's camera sensors are smaller than those found in the Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro. As a result, low-light images may not turn out as well. Furthermore, the battery life is not the greatest, and wireless charging is quite slow.
The Pixel 7a is a compelling device that offers exceptional value for its price. It's packed with features, including a beautiful display, powerful performance, and an impressive camera. While it may have some downsides, such as smaller camera sensors and average battery life, the overall experience is still quite impressive, making it an excellent choice for those looking for a reliable and affordable smartphone.
More Christine Romero-Chan / Digital Trends OnePlus Nord N300 5G The best Android phone under $250 Sleek and lightweight design 90Hz refresh rate on a large 6.56-inch display Nice tactile haptics Great selfie camera Expandable storage via microSD 5,000mAh battery with 33W fast charging Lower-res screen resolution 2MP depth camera doesn't add much Won't get updates after Android 13 Only available on T-Mobile Why you should buy this: It has problems, but it's still a great smartphone for less than $250.
Who it's for: Someone who doesn't mind living with a few compromises, as long as they get a bargain Android phone.
Why we picked the OnePlus Nord N300 5G : The budget smartphone market can be something of a minefield, and it's rare for a cheap smartphone to showcase good performance in a range of categories. The OnePlus Nord N300 5G is one of those rare smartphones, and it's the best Android phone you can buy for under $250.
The design is pretty much what you expect from a $250 phone. That is to say, it's made from plastic. It's good-looking plastic, has a slight shimmer like aluminum, and feels good in the hand too. The display is disappointing. It's only 720p, which means details can look a little soft on the 6.56-inch display. It has a 90Hz refresh rate , though, which is a very welcome (and surprising) addition.
Performance is good, even if it's not going to run 3D games without a little bit of lag from time to time. The main 48MP lens on the camera is good, even if it doesn't match real-life colors, but the 2MP depth lens is really quite pointless. But it's more than good enough for this price level. The same can be said for the battery, which lasted two days on a single charge, and has 33W fast charging.
It's not perfect, of course. As mentioned, the second camera lens might as well not exist, and the display is on the more disappointing side. However, even with these downsides in mind, the OnePlus Nord N300 5G is an excellent phone for the money. It'll cost you $228, but it's only available through T-Mobile and Metro.
Andy Boxall / Digital Trends Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 The best foldable Android phone Thinner and lighter than ever Silent, high-quality hinge Strong multitasking tools Fun, social media-friendly camera Inner screen is perfect for games and video IPX8 and durable chassis Battery life hasn't dramatically improved Slow charging Why you should buy this: With five years of experience, Samsung really proves that with the Galaxy Z Fold 5.
Who it's for: Multitaskers who like the flexibility of a large, but manageable screen.
Why we picked the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 : The fifth generation Galaxy Z Fold shows that Samsung knows what it's doing in the foldable market. The Z Fold 5 has some great improvements over its predecessor, making it one of the best folding phones you can buy, as well as a great smartphone overall.
One of the big flaws of the previous Z Fold 4 was the visible gap when closed.
The Z Fold 5 fixes this with the new Flex Hinge design , which means an overall better look and ergonomic feel when you use it closed. It also means less dirt and debris can get in between the inside screens.
Despite the hinge change, the size of the Galaxy Z Fold 5 is the same. You still have a 6.2-inch cover display with 2316 x 904 pixel resolution, and the inner display is 7.6-inches with 2176 x 1812 resolution. Both screens have a 120Hz dynamic refresh rate, so everything looks great. You also get Flex Mode when watching videos, and this time you get the controls on the lower half of the screen for convenience.
The cameras include a 50MP main, 12MP ultrawide, and 10MP telephoto. Like most Samsung phones, the colors will be very bright and saturated in direct sunlight. However, if you take photos that aren't in harsh lighting conditions, they actually look more natural and realistic than other Samsung phones, which is very nice. Optical zoom is better too, but it may have some issues with focusing close in on 1x or 3x mode.
Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 has Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 for Galaxy for the best performance and efficiency possible. You also have 12GB RAM and your choice of 256GB, 512GB, or 1TB internal storage options. It comes with Android 13 and One UI 5.1.1 out of the box. Some improvements with the software include a better taskbar, which now shows up to four recent apps rather than two. There is also the ability to have three apps at once on the screen, along with a floating window.
The Galaxy Z Fold 5 has enough battery power to get through a day on a single charge. It also supports up to 25W fast charging, so it goes from zero to 100 in about 80 minutes. There is also support for a stylus with the new S Pen Fold Edition, which is improved from the predecessor as well with 4,096 pressure levels, IP68 water and dust resistance.
The $1,800 price will prevent plenty of people from buying, but if you have the cash to spare, it's hard to find a better foldable experience than the Galaxy Z Fold 5.
More Christine Romero-Chan / Digital Trends OnePlus Open The best foldable Android phone runner-up Great compact and lightweight size Powerful cameras Beautiful screens Anti-glare inner display Opens flat easily 67W fast charging Intuitive multitasking Hinge isn't firm enough Large camera bump Macro and 120x Super Res are not great Why you should buy this: OnePlus has made a fantastic entry into the folding device market with an innovative and enjoyable device.
Who it's for: Anyone who wants a folding device that isn't from Samsung or Google.
Why we picked the OnePlus Open : The OnePlus Open is an extraordinary device that comes as a surprise. As the company's first-ever foldable device, it is built with meticulous attention to detail, using lightweight materials like titanium to create a truly compact and user-friendly device. It is an excellent choice for those who value innovation, performance, and portability.
Let’s start with the phone’s cover and inner displays. The former is sized much better than something like the Galaxy Z Fold, which offers tall and narrow cover screens. Here, things feel less cramped, making the experience much more positive. The inner display is gorgeous, with colors that are bright and saturated. Meanwhile, text is always sharp, scrolling is smooth, thanks to its 120Hz refresh rate, and the anti-reflective display makes it a joy to use even outside.
The OnePlus Open comes with Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chipset, an Adreno 740 GPU, 16GB RAM, and 512GB storage. There’s also OnePlus’ custom OxygenOS 13.2 OS that sits on Android 13. The OnePlus Open will receive four major Android version upgrades plus five years of security updates. These promises don’t match what Google’s offering on its new Pixel 8 lineup, but they aren’t disastrous either.
Performance-wise, the OnePlus Open works very well. We didn’t detect any performance issues during our tests, even when multiple apps were open.
Open Canvas is one of our favorite OxygenOS features. It provides a new way to multitask and was designed from scratch. Its goal is to allow you to increase everyday productivity with multi-window efficiency on a larger display.
Joe Maring / Digital Trends Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 The best flip phone Android phone No more gap when folded shut Extremely well-built Hinge feels outstanding Much more useful cover screen Fantastic performance Good and dependable cameras 5 years of updates The crease is still there Mediocre battery life Cover screen requires lots of tweaking Why you should buy this: It is one of the best flip phones you can buy today.
Who it's for: It appeals to the user who desires a compact, retro-style flip phone but with modern-day accouterments.
Why we picked the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5: Want a foldable but think the Z Fold 5 isn't compact enough? Then you should consider the Galaxy Z Flip 5 instead, which is also a huge improvement over its predecessor.
With the Z Flip 5, you get a 3.4-inch cover display, which is much better than last year's 1.9-inch cover display. This larger window lets you see bigger clocks, widgets, and even run full apps on the cover screen.
 The display is shaped like a folder so it doesn't interfere with the cameras, and while the 60Hz refresh rate could be better, it looks fine in almost every situation.
The inside display of the Galaxy Z Flip 5 is a 6.7-inch Dynamic AMOLED with 2640 x 1080 resolution and it has a 120Hz refresh rate. In other words, you get bright, vivid colors that pop, and sharp text with smooth scrolling animations. However, the crease is definitely visible.
The cameras are similar to the Flip 4, as you have a 12MP main shooter with f/1.8 aperture and OIS, plus a 12MP ultrawide camera with 123-degree field of view. But the Z Flip 5 has better color reproduction than before, and there is a clear lens coating to help prevent lens flare. The selfie camera also has a larger sensor.
Like the Z Fold 5 and S23 series, there is a Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor in the Z Flip 5, giving you optimal performance and efficiency. It also has 8GB RAM and either 256GB or 512GB of storage options to choose from. It comes with Android 13 and Samsung's One UI 5.1.1 out of the box. Battery life is about one full day with a 3,700mAh battery, and you get 25W fast charging, 15W wireless, and 4.5W reverse wireless.
More Andy Boxall / Digital Trends Motorola Razr (2023) The best cheap foldable Android phone Lightweight and compact Camera is great for social media Fast battery charging Cute Moo character brightens up the cover screen Dust and water resistance No always-on screen Slow wireless charging Can get warm when pushed hard Why you should buy this: It's a folding Android phone that isn't outrageously expensive.
Who's it for: If you want a foldable phone that doesn't break the bank.
Why we picked the Motorola Razr (2023) : The Motorola Razr (2023) has captured the attention of many because of its compact and sleek flip design. Its simple yet reliable design keeps the price low, making it a budget-friendly option for daily use.
The phone boasts three standout features: its camera system, fast battery charging, and dust and water resistance. The main module consists of two cameras: a 64-megapixel main camera with optical image stabilization (OIS) and laser autofocus, and a 13MP wide-angle camera with a 120-degree field of view. The wide-angle camera is also capable of taking macro shots.
The Razr's main camera is surprisingly solid. Our testing revealed photos that are lively and colorful, with just the right amount of saturation and HDR. However, in some scenarios, the photos appear washed-out and artificial. There is also a lack of consistency in exposure between the main and wide-angle cameras. Nevertheless, we appreciated the dramatic tone of the wide-angle camera.
There are a few drawbacks to the Razr (2023) that users should be aware of. The cover screen does not display notifications and time all the time, which may be inconvenient for some. Additionally, the wireless charging feature is not top-of-the-line, and the phone's processor may struggle when handling heavy loads.
Despite these minor issues, the Motorola Razr is still an outstanding purchase for anyone seeking an affordable folding phone or simply wanting to stand out from the crowd. It is one of the most cost-effective methods of experiencing the newest foldable smartphone technology, making it an ideal choice for those who want to stay ahead of the curve.
Frequently Asked Questions We've highlighted Samsung a lot above, and Samsung does make some of the best phones. But it depends on your price range. Samsung is the king of the higher Android price bracket, but head further down, and you start to notice the Google Pixels and other more modest budget models. The bigger names you recognize should definitely be preferred, as quality can be an issue when you start experimenting with obscure brands.
That said, you should not base a buying decision solely on a brand name, as any manufacturer can make a bad phone. Instead, check out individual phone reviews, and decide that way.
Price, screen size, camera capabilities, durability, and processing power are some of the most important factors to consider when buying a phone. If you work or game on your phone, you’ll want a device with speedy processing. If you take a lot of pictures or videos, the camera might be a make-or-break factor for you.
Android phones run on the Android operating system, while iPhones run on iOS. But this is only the beginning. Android phones typically offer USB-C charging, while Apple phones use Lightning chargers, at least for now. Users praise Apple for its clean interface, lack of bloatware, privacy, and ease of integration with other Apple devices. Users praise Android for its easy customization, integration with Windows and other devices, affordability, expansion, and innovation.
Most modern smartphones should last at least three years, and ideally up to five years. Google and Samsung both promise multiple years of updates and security patches.
Many Android phones offer exceptional cameras, including Google’s Pixel 6a, which we named the best camera-value Android phone in this list. The Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra and the Google Pixel 7 also have stellar camera systems, producing some of the best photos you can get out of a smartphone.
A good phone’s battery should last you most of the day, and all the phones on this list meet that standard. However, be aware that high-intensity games, constant music or media streaming, videoconferencing, and other activities that work the processor will cause battery drain sooner. Note too that battery size is only one component of longevity. Most smartphone batteries are optimized to work with the phone's hardware and software for optimal performance.
