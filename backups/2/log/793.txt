From spawning a few vehicles to loading your gun with flaming bullets, cheat codes turn GTA 5 into a god game, where you can control the parameters of the sandbox you’re playing in, so it’s no surprise it’s one of the bestselling games of all time.
 No matter what platform you’re playing on, these GTA 5 cheats and secrets will work. But keep in mind: Cheats stop you from earning trophies and achievements while they’re live, so keep them for playtime only.
How to use GTA 5 cheats GTA 5 character cheats GTA 5 world cheats GTA 5 car cheats GTA 5 PC cheats Is there a money cheat in GTA 5 How to use GTA 5 cheats There are a few ways to enter GTA 5 cheat codes. The first and easiest is to use your cellphone. You can open your cellphone by pressing Up on the D-pad. From there, enter the corresponding number, and the cheat will fire. You can also classically input cheats by following a specific button combination. The combinations are the same across PlayStation and Xbox, but we’ve split them up to account for their different button-naming conventions, so it should feel more natural reading and entering them.

If you’re running low on cash in the game, there are legitimate ways to build a balance, such as completing missions, participating in heists, and using the in-game stock market to your advantage. You can also purchase “Shark Cards” with real-world money, which give you in-game currency.
Editors' Recommendations The best PS5 exclusives The best PS5 games for 2023 PS5 slim vs. PS5: everything you need to know about the new PS5 model The best multiplayer games on the PS5 Best gaming console deals: cheapest prices on PS5, Xbox S and X and Switch Action Games Grand Theft Auto Gaming Cross-platform support is becoming more important in the world of video games. Multiplayer hits like Call of Duty: Warzone 2.0 and Fortnite have pushed crossplay into the limelight, and now most AAA multiplayer games release with at least partial cross-platform support. Finding every cross-platform game is no easy feat, though, so we did the hard work to bring you a comprehensive list of games that support crossplay.
Unfortunately, there aren't any rules when it comes to crossplay, so each game handles the feature a little differently. To make matters more confusing, certain backward-compatible games on the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X still support crossplay on the most recent hardware, even if there isn't an official release for that hardware.
Gaming Although sales aren’t the only metric relevant to how good a game is, it’s a decent measurement of how influential certain titles have been over time. With this list of the bestselling video games of all time, we'll take a look at the cream of the crop.
Some interesting notes before diving in: Many of the titles below were included as part of a hardware bundle at some point, with the exception of a small handful of games. Several are also exclusive to one console -- mainly Nintendo games. It's also worth noting that many of the sales stats for the following games are a couple of years old at this point and are likely higher today.
Gaming Xbox Game Pass is kicking off July with a major surprise, as Grand Theft Auto V has returned to the service. Rockstar's sales juggernaut leads an otherwise light month for Game Pass, which brings Capcom's Exoprimal as a day-one launch.
This isn't the first time that Grand Theft Auto V has been on Game Pass. It was previously on the service circa 2021 but removed from it that August. Rockstar has a history of putting its games on Game Pass for a brief window before pulling it, as it also did with Red Dead Redemption 2.
