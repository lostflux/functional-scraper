Why trust us? The best sci-fi movies on Netflix right now By Blair Marnell , Nick Perry and Michael Bizzaco Close It would be nice if Netflix gave sci-fi movies the same kind of attention that romantic comedies , action films , and thrillers get on the streaming service. Instead, there are only a comparative handful of sci-fi titles at any given time, as Netflix relies on outside studios to shore up its sci-fi selection. It’s even worse if you’re looking for fantasy movies on Netflix.
 This month, Netflix only added three sci-fi films of note: Godzilla: King of the Monsters , Prometheus , and Real Steel.
Keep reading for our roundup of the best sci-fi movies on Netflix, and we’ll give you the top options that subscribers opt for when they want to vicariously visit another world.
In need of a few more suggestions? We’ve curated a guide to the best sci-fi movies on Amazon Prime Video and the best sci-fi movies on Hulu , too.
Save on everything from laptops and tablets, to coffee makers and air purifiers, and a whole host of Apple tech like iPad, Apple Watch and even the latest M3 MacBooks, as well as smart home essentials like the Amazon Echo and smart bulbs.

 This time, classic monsters like Rodan and Mothra make their modern debuts, as Titans start awakening all over the world. But Godzilla’s reign as the king is threatened by an even more formidable three-headed beast called King Ghidorah.
Dr. Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga) had some very extreme ideas about using the Titans to heal the Earth, and this mess with the reawakened Titans is largely her fault. That’s why Emma’s estranged husband, Dr. Mark Russell (Kyle Chandler), and their young daughter, Madison Russell ( Stranger Things actress Millie Bobby Brown), attempt to help Godzilla come out on top.

Captain Janek ( Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty ‘s Idris Elba), Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace), Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron), and the rest of Prometheus’ crew are accompanied by David ( The Killer ‘s Michael Fassbender), an android who isn’t particularly fond of humanity. And David’s machinations unleash something that even he can’t control.

When Charlie’s ex-girlfriend dies, he temporarily assumes custody of Max.
Father and son bond when they find Atom in a junkyard, and the robot turns out to be a resilient fighter in the ring. But when the unexpected trio faces a major setback, Charlie will need to figure out what he really wants out of life.

Before Paul can fulfill that destiny, his father Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac) is betrayed by the Emperor to their greatest enemies, House Harkonnen.

Because of Ray’s foresight, he and his children have the only working car in the city. But with the aliens’ relentless onslaught, that advantage doesn’t last long. Even if Ray can find his way back to Mary, he may not be able to protect his children from this hell on Earth.

Since the cure for his condition can only be found on Elysium, Max accepts a risky job to attack Armadyne Corp CRO John Carlyle (William Fichtner).
What Max doesn’t know is that the info he stole from Carlyle’s head is proof that Defense Secretary Jessica Delacourt (Jodie Foster) is attempting to pull off a coup and assume control of Elysium.

The popular 2012 sci-fi remake, Dredd , was also far from a commercial blockbuster, but it’s a much better movie. Karl Urban absolutely owns the title role as Dredd, one of the leading Judges in Mega-City One. Olivia Thirlby co-stars as Cassandra Anderson, a rookie Judge with psi powers who is out on her training evaluation with Dredd.
In this dystopian future, Judges are the equivalent of the police and the courts, and they have the authority to dispense justice as they see fit. Unfortunately for Anderson and Dredd, they soon find themselves locked in an apartment high rise run by a crime lord, Madeline “Ma-Ma” Madrigal (Lena Headey). And she’ll do anything to see both Judges dead.

When Toby is accidentally killed, Tenma is able to recreate Toby’s personality in the body of a robot that eventually takes the name Astro. And while Astro is not truly Toby, his innate goodness leads him to become a hero to his fellow robots, as well as the protector that Metro City desperately needs.
