Published on Wednesday, Time’s report focuses on Microsoft-backed OpenAI and its ChatGPT chatbot , a technology that’s gained much attention recently for its remarkable ability to produce highly natural conversational text.
Time’s probe found that to train the AI technology, OpenAI used the services of a team in Kenya to pore over text that included disturbing subject matter such as child sexual abuse, bestiality, murder, suicide, torture, self-harm, and incest. And for their efforts to label the abhorrent content, many on the team received less than $2 an hour.
GPT-4 Turbo is the biggest update since ChatGPT’s launch Apple may finally beef up Siri with AI smarts next year Bing Chat just beat a security check to stop hackers and spammers The work, which started in November 2021, was necessary as ChatGPT’s predecessor, GPT-3, while impressive, had a tendency to spew out offensive content as its training dataset had been compiled by scraping hundreds of billions of words from all corners of the web.
The Kenya-based team, operated by San Francisco firm Sama, would label the offensive content to help train OpenAI’s chatbot, thereby improving its dataset and reducing the chances of any objectionable output.
Time said that all four of the Sama employees that it interviewed described being mentally scarred by their work. Sama offered counseling sessions, but the employees said they were ineffective and rarely took place due to the demands of the job, though a Sama spokesperson told Time that the therapists were accessible at any time.
One worker told Time that reading the shocking material sometimes felt like “torture,” adding that they felt “disturbed” by the end of the week.
In February 2022, things took an even darker turn for Sama when OpenAI launched a separate project unrelated to ChatGPT that required its Kenya team to collect images of a sexual and violent nature. OpenAI told Time that the work was necessary for making its AI tools safer.
Within weeks of this image-based project starting, the alarming nature of the tasks prompted Sama to cancel all of its contracts with OpenAI, though Time suggests it could also have been prompted by the PR fallout from a report on a similar subject matter that it published about Facebook at around the same time.
Open AI told Time there had been “a miscommunication” about the nature of the imagery that it asked Sama to collect, insisting that it had not asked for the most extreme imagery, and had not viewed any that it had been sent.
But ending the contracts impacted the workers’ livelihoods, with some of the team in Kenya losing their jobs, while others were moved onto lower-paying projects.
Time’s investigation offers an uncomfortable but important look at the kind of work that’s going into the AI-powered chatbots that have recently been getting the tech industry so excited.
While transformative and potentially beneficial, the technology clearly comes at a human cost and throws up a slew of ethical questions about how companies go about developing their new technologies, and more broadly about how wealthier countries continue to farm out less desirable tasks to poorer nations for a lower financial outlay.
The startups behind the tech will come under more focused scrutiny in the coming months and years, and so they would do well to review and improve their practices at the earliest opportunity.
Digital Trends has reached out to OpenAI for comment on Time’s report and we will update this article when we hear back.
Editors' Recommendations The world responds to the creator of ChatGPT being fired by his own company New ‘poisoning’ tool spells trouble for AI text-to-image tech OpenAI’s new tool can spot fake AI images, but there’s a catch Bing Chat’s ads are sending users to dangerous malware sites ChatGPT: the latest news, controversies, and tips you need to know Artificial Intelligence Tech News Computing ChatGPT has just regained the ability to browse the internet to help you find information. That should (hopefully) help you get more accurate, up-to-date data right when you need it, rather than solely relying on the artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot’s rather outdated training data.
As well as giving straight-up answers to your questions based on info found online, ChatGPT developer OpenAI revealed that the tool will provide a link to its sources so you can check the facts yourself. If it turns out that ChatGPT was wrong or misleading, well, that’s just another one for the chatbot’s long list of missteps.
Computing Meta Connect started with the Quest 3 announcement but that’s not the only big news. The metaverse company is also a leader in AI and has released several valuable models to the open-source community. Today, Meta announced its generative AI is coming soon to its social media apps, and it looks both fun and useful.
Meta AI for text When CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced Meta AI for social media, it seemed interesting. When one of the custom AIs looked like Snoop Dogg wearing Dungeons and Dragons gear, there was a gasp from the live audience, followed by whoops of joy and applause.
Meta AI's Dungeon Master looks like Snoop Dogg. Meta Computing OpenAI is rolling out new functionalities for ChatGPT that will allow prompts to be executed with images and voice directives in addition to text.
The AI brand announced on Monday that it will be making these new features available over the next two weeks to ChatGPT Plus and Enterprise users. The voice feature is available in iOS and Android in an opt-in capacity, while the images feature is available on all ChatGPT platforms. OpenAI notes it plans to expand the availability of the images and voice features beyond paid users after the staggered rollout.
