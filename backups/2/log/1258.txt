Home Tech Wearables Headphones The best headphones you can buy Written by Allison Murray, Staff Writer Christina Darby, Associate Editor Oct. 27, 2023 at 7:16 a.m. PT Nina Raemont View now View at Best Buy View now View at Target View now View at Amazon View now View at Amazon View now View at Best Buy View now View at Walmart With the crisp sound and immersive noise cancellation of the best pair of headphones, you might feel motivated enough to finally go on that run you've been putting off, finish up that music video you've been editing, or get to the next level of your favorite video game.
Also: The best wireless headphones And in recent years, headphones have evolved from a listening tool into a street style and work-wear statement piece. That's not all: they are actually better for long-term hearing than their popular, pocket-sized alternative: the earbud.
With new technology rollouts, such as active noise cancellation (ANC) and voice integration with Google Assistant, Alexa, and Siri, headphones keep getting better and smarter with ever-more options to choose from. But before you go and spend your hard-earned cash on just any pair, make sure that the over-ear style can suit your lifestyle and needs.
Also: The best cheap headphones To help make that process easier, ZDNET has rounded up what our experts consider to be the best in class for you and your listening preferences. Our favorite pair of headphones overall are the Sony's WH-1000XM5 headphones for their market-leading active noise cancellation, advanced voice chat quality, and quick-charging capabilities.
The best headphones of 2023 Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones Best headphones overall Matthew Miller/ZDNET Pros & Cons Market-leading ANC Advanced voice chat quality makes for quality video conferencing A 3-minute quick charge lasts 3 hours Divisive aesthetics Larger carrying case than previous generations Expensive More Details Sony WH-1000XM5 tech specs: Form factor: Over-ear, closed-back | Connectivity : Bluetooth 5.2 | Battery life : 30 hours (3 hours on a 3-minute charge) | Frequency response : 4Hz-40,000Hz Sony's WH-1000XM5 series headphones have been the go-to for active noise cancellation (ANC) technology since their popularity in the 1980s. The WH-1000XM5 headphones have raised Sony's bar even higher, offering the best ANC technology yet, with 30 hours of battery life and a quick charging time of 3 minutes for 3 hours of activity. These headphones provide the perfect sound escape. As ZDNET writer Matthew Miller pointed out in his full review , these headphones have also improved on an often overlooked factor that is becoming increasingly important in a video-conferencing world: "outstanding" microphone quality. "It's great to have a single headset with long battery life taking on all of my headset duties," he writes.
Review: Sony's WH-1000XM5 headphones are basically perfect At a price tag of $400, the advanced tech suite doesn't come cheap. However, for someone who frequently forgets to charge their headphones, the quick charger benefits offer an opportunity cost. The comfortable fit, despite controversial aesthetic reviews, makes blocking out surrounding sounds possible and practical. Bottom line, these comfortable headphones are perfect for working professionals who want to spend their headphone time plugging into projects or calls instead of plugging into a charger.

Well, you're in luck. Sony announced that the WH-CH520 over-ear headphones offer Sony's star quality in a more compact and affordable size, as reported by ZDNET in February.
 Instead of paying $400 for Sony's multipoint connectivity, Bluetooth 5.2, and sleek aesthetic, you can pay $60 and opt for the WH-CH520 model.
You might be asking yourself if the dramatic drop in price comes with a decrease in quality. Sony headphone enthusiasts and customer reviews prove otherwise. These lightweight headphones seem to offer a sound signature that meets Sony's superb standards, custom EQ adjustments, and impressive battery life, all rolled into a breathable design with cushioned ear pads for all-day wear.
Also: The best headphones for workouts and running I will note, however, that you will be sacrificing Sony's renowned ANC technology. Sony boasts "noise blocking" with this model, but there are no external mics to combat intrusive noise.
 Nevertheless, if you are a casual listener who doesn't mind external sounds leaking in and values the surround sound of the headphones themselves, then these are a great option.
View now at Target View now at B&H Photo-Video View now at Best Buy more buying choices HyperX Cloud Alpha Wireless headphones Best headphones for gaming Taylor Clemons/ZDNET Pros & Cons Spatial audio sound Made from comfortable memory foam Outstanding battery life No Bluetooth connectivity option Can't use with mobile devices or Nintendo Switch Long battery life means a long charging time More Details HyperX Cloud Alpha Wireless specs: Form factor: Over-ear | Connectivity: USB adapter | Battery life: 300 hours | Frequency response: 15Hz-21kHz The last thing you want to think about during a video game is your headphones' battery life. The HyperX Cloud headphones provide an impressive 300 hours of battery life. If you do the math (which we did), you can game and stream for eight hours a day for over a month before needing to recharge. This is even with the DTS Headphone:X audio drivers enabled. Additionally, the microphone is detachable, so you can remove it depending on the type of gaming you're doing. It's also adjustable, so you don't peak your audio or sound muffled while talking to other gamers.
ZDNET's own Taylor Clemons reviewed the HyperXCloud headphones while streaming, gaming, and making work calls and praised the headset for their robust battery, clean audio, and custom EQ settings.
Review: HyperX Cloud Alpha Wireless: Solid, no-nonsense audio for gaming, music, and more This headset has excellent audio quality that provides rich, clean sound even at low volumes. The Ngenuity desktop app enables or disables the spatial audio and DTS Headphone:X settings, allowing you to monitor battery life, adjust volume, and create custom equalizer settings. This ensures that no matter what you're playing, it will sound its absolute best.

That's right, wired headphones still exist and are, controversially, still worth it. The Beyerdynamic DT 990 Pro X headphones are living proof. This model is a mid-range headphone option for mixing, streaming, or for audiophiles who want to hear every detail in their music. The detachable mini-XLR cable can be changed at will or exchanged with other connection options.
These headphones are open-backed , allowing air and sound to transmit freely through the earcups' grills, resulting in a more natural, speaker-like sound. If you're producing and mixing, you can definitely hear the difference in their natural frequency response and reliable sound. Plus, the included memory foam provides an ergonomic and comfortable fit, making the over-ear fit feel less constrictive.
Review: Beyerdynamic DT 900 Pro X headphones: Brutally honest sound for under $300 Evident from our 4/5 review rating , these wired headphones are too good to be left out of your consideration, delivering, what our review says, "precisely what it says on the tin: provides you with a relatively affordable, brutally honest audio solution for mixing and audio engineering." View now at Amazon Apple AirPods Max Best headphones for Apple users Apple/ZDNET Pros & Cons All of the benefits of the AirPod line for Apple device owners Different color options with a sturdy design Almost universally-praised sound quality Proprietary lightning cable charging Bulky and heavy Most expensive option on this list More Details Apple AirPods Max specs: Form factor: Over-ear, closed-back | Connectivity Bluetooth 5.0 | Battery life : 20 hours (1.5 hours on a 5-minute charge) | Frequency response : 10 Hz-20,000 Hz (estimated) Despite being newcomers in the over-ear headphone market, Apple's AirPods Max have unsurprisingly established quite the Apple-ecosystem fanbase. These over-ear headphones are the only device that combines exceptional sound with all the same benefits that Apple device owners have enjoyed for years with the smaller AirPods earbuds. These features include instant connectivity, multi-device switching, and the ability to tweak settings and view charge levels on any Apple device.
Even ZDNET's Jason Cipriani sings the AirPods Max's praises for their impressive Transparency Mode and Spatial Audio, claiming the cans majorly elevated his viewing of The Mandalorian.
Review: AirPods Max: Stunning sound and performance mean I'm keeping the $550 headphones The sound quality of the Apple AirPods Max is by far the best of any Apple headphones today, especially with their ANC technology that meets or exceeds what competitors like Sony and Bose currently offer. If you're an avid Apple user and don't mind spending a little more, the Apple AirPods Max are an excellent choice for headphones.

With four neutral, matte colorways to choose from and updated features like noise canceling and transparency mode, the Studio Pros offer audio and aesthetic improvements for a $350 price tag. When ZDNET's Jada Jones tested out the headphones , she complimented the "fantastic" active noise cancelation and lossless audio that captured the cinematic sound of the Oppenheimer film score -- sans the cinema.
The new earcups sport UltraPlush, a comfortable memory foam covered by faux leather, which is a significant textural upgrade from the synthetic leather material of the Beats Solo 3 that crumbles off the earcup with continual use. These headphones serve Android and Apple users alike and boast luxury features incomparable to many Apple audio products. The one downside, however, is that some features, like multipoint connection, aren't compatible with iPhones.

How did we choose these headphones? We selected these headphones after conducting thorough research by either using them to listen to music and podcasts or by evaluating the reviews of other ZDNET writers. To provide you with a comprehensive guide, we also compared sound quality, price, battery life, feel, and functionality.
Sound quality: A good pair of headphones should, unsurprisingly, deliver high quality, clean and crisp sound. We played our favorite songs and listened to our favorite podcasts using these headphones to see which boasted the best sound. While better frequency response does not always result in better sound quality, checking the frequency response range can give you a sense of how robust of sound you will receive with your headphones (20 to 20,000 Hz is widely accepted as a good frequency response range).
Price: Decent sound shouldn't cost you your whole paycheck. While some of the highlighted options go for more than $300, there are a few affordable headphone options on this list that offer competitive sound without the luxury features of a $500 AirPods Max.
Battery life: What good is crisp sound if your headphones die on you all too soon? Competitive battery life is a must for your headphones, and pairs on this list offer anywhere from 20 to 500 hours of undeterred listening time.
Feel: If your headphones are too heavy or uncomfortable on your head, why would you wear them all day? We considered weight and overall feel as we tested these to find a pair that delivers great sound without the head or ear ache.
Functionality: Details like how these headphones connect to your music or whether they seamlessly switch from one Bluetooth device to another were considered as we curated this list.
Are headphones healthier than earbuds? Over-the-ear and on-ear headphones are considered a better option than earbuds for your health since you're not physically sticking anything in your ear. However, regular headphones can still cause hearing issues if you turn up the volume too loud or wear them for more than an hour at a time.
Check out ZDNET's tips for preventing hearing loss caused by headphones for how to listen healthily.
Do headphones get worse over time? On average, a pair of headphones will last about two to three years before the components start to wear down or malfunction. However, a good quality pair of headphones that's more expensive should last you longer (about four to five years).
What makes noise-canceling headphones better than regular headphones? Noise-canceling headphones use advanced technology to actively reduce external noise, providing a more immersive and distraction-free listening experience. They're especially useful in noisy environments, such as public transportation or busy offices.
Are there alternative headphones worth considering? While the options listed above should get you pretty far, you might still be interested in alternative headphone options. Here are a few other options to look into.
Best alternative JBL Tour One M2 These headphones are stellar for deep work, with amazing noise cancellation, Smart Talk that automatically pauses as you begin a conversation, and impressive sound. Anyone who spends their days in an office or heads down at a computer will love the JBL Tour One M2 headphones.
