From teen rom-coms that defined a generation to modern-day takes on the genre, there's something for everyone. Yes, that means there are options even if you aren't into the traditional sappy rom-com fare.
If you're looking for a good rom-com that will be a compromise between partners, or maybe you want to curl up and watch one yourself, we have you covered with this constantly updated list. We keep track of what has left Amazon Prime Video and what new titles have arrived so you don't have to. Peruse this list and you're sure to find something that fits your mood.
Entertainment The best shows on Max (formerly HBO Max) right now include a variety of new series like The Last of Us and House of the Dragon. But sometimes, it's the old gems that we're really in the mood. With the untimely passing of Matthew Perry, chances are that those who grew up in the 1990s and 2000s will be looking to relive old episodes of Friends, and they're all available to stream on Max.
Also this month, the Max Original Julia returns with its second season to continue the story of influential and trailblazing celebrity cook, cooking show host, and author Julia Child. The new adult animated series Scavenger's Reign has also been gaining attention. From classic sitcoms to new dramas, comedies, thrillers, and more, Max has it all. Could it be any better? Deals It would be almost impossible to make it through life these days without hearing about Amazon Prime because it is one of the largest ecommerce storefronts ever. What you really need to know is that the online retailer's premium subscription comes with a boatload of great benefits and services. You might be a bit less familiar with Amazon Prime Video, though. Prime Video is Amazon's streaming service that competes with the likes of Netflix and Hulu, offering a wide variety of shows, movies, and Prime original series. There are a couple of ways to get Prime Video, but it's not free. However, if you're here, you're probably looking for an answer to the burning question: Is there an Amazon Prime Video free trial? We've got the answer, and more, below.
Is there an Amazon Prime Video free trial? There is indeed an Amazon Prime Video free trial, but it's tied into the Prime free trial, which lasts for a month and may or may not be available to you. To see if you're eligible, you'll need to and check. The general rule is that the Prime free trial (and by extension, an Amazon Prime Video free trial) is available to Amazon accounts that have either never signed up for a Prime trial or have not had Prime -- either a trial or paid membership -- any time in the last 12 months.
