As we expected, it combines innovative new features with the return of much-loved old favorites like MagSafe. It’s an enticing device, albeit an expensive one given its $1,999 starting price.
Going toe-to-toe with the MacBook Air The MacBook Pro 14 pulls ahead A niche machine But while all the excitement centers on this shiny new laptop, it’s thrown last year’s 13-inch M1 MacBook Pro into the shade. Apple is still selling this device, but compared to the MacBook Air and the new MacBook Pro 14, it is struggling to stake out a claim to relevance. In fact, you probably shouldn’t buy the MacBook Pro 13 at all. Here’s why.
Going toe-to-toe with the MacBook Air Image used with permission by copyright holder Even before we got our first glimpse of the MacBook Pro 14 at Apple’s October event , the M1-enabled MacBook Pro 13 was struggling to make a case for itself. It overlapped the M1 MacBook Air in a huge number of areas, yet cost upwards of $300 more. Unless you had very specific reasons — or couldn’t resist the Pro moniker — the MacBook Air was usually the more convincing choice.
Now, as then, the MacBook Air and the MacBook Pro 13 share a conspicuous number of features. They both come with the same two Thunderbolt 3 ports, the same Magic Keyboard, and the same storage and RAM options. And while the battery life and the M1 chip’s graphics options are slightly different between them, they are close enough to be negligible.
Yet despite all that, the MacBook Air is $300 cheaper than the MacBook Pro. It’s also thinner and lighter, highlighting how little extra you get with the MacBook Pro 13’s added bulk.
All of this puts the MacBook Pro 13 in a really awkward spot. If you want an entry-level Apple laptop, the MacBook Air is undoubtedly the better choice. But things get more bleak for the MacBook Pro 13 when you consider the new 14-inch variant.
The MacBook Pro 14 pulls ahead Image used with permission by copyright holder You can configure the MacBook Pro 13 to have some higher-end perks, but even that can’t make it compete with Apple’s brand-new MacBook Pro 14 , which offers far more pro-level features and performance. Plus you even get a notch.
For instance, let’s take the $1,499 MacBook Pro 13 that comes with the M1 chip, 8GB of memory, and 512GB of storage. You can bump its memory up to 16B and its storage to 1TB, which takes the price to $1,899.
Yet compared to the base MacBook Pro 14 model, you’re still getting a vastly inferior chip, no MagSafe, fewer ports and less port variety, and a lower-quality display. You’ll only be paying $100 less than the MacBook Pro 14, despite last year’s laptop being a far less impressive machine.
I can understand Apple wanting to keep an entry-level MacBook Pro around for people who are desperate to go “Pro,” but don’t want to pay $1,999 or more, but in doing so, the company has made its laptop an almost impossible sell. Compared to the MacBook Pro 14, it’s not even a close contest. Then, when you go down a few pricing, err, notches, the MacBook Air outcompetes the MacBook Pro 13 for $300 less. Right now, last year’s MacBook Pro is so far from being the best MacBook that its existence is hard to justify.
A niche machine Image used with permission by copyright holder Yet, there are still a few reasons you might want to pick up a MacBook Pro 13. Compared to the MacBook Air, the MacBook Pro 13 offers better speakers and microphones, a brighter display, slightly better graphics performance, and a little more battery life.
 The MacBook Pro 14 tops it in all those aspects, but it costs a lot more. That means that, in some specific cases, the MacBook Pro 13 hits the sweet spot between the MacBook Air and the MacBook Pro 14.
And then there’s the Touch Bar. The MacBook Pro 13 is now the only MacBook to come with this touch-sensitive strip, and it’s clear Apple will soon phase it out since it was absent on the MacBook Pro 14. During its five years of life, the Touch Bar has been divisive, but I know people who swear by it. If you want it, the MacBook Pro 13 is the only way to get it.
The problem is that all these benefits are decidedly niche. There’s no truly standout reason to get the MacBook Pro 13, and plenty of persuasive reasons to avoid it. It was a strange decision by Apple to keep it around without dropping the price, but it’s what we’re stuck with. Unless you have very particular needs, it’s a device that is best avoided.
Editors' Recommendations A major era in MacBook history is finally over Here’s more proof that Apple is wrong about MacBook memory 5 things you should never do with your MacBook How to watch Apple’s ‘Scary Fast’ Mac launch event if you missed it Why the MacBook Air is still stuck on the M2 Apple Apple Laptops Mac Computing Macs with Apple silicon were a revelation when they launched three years ago, but we haven't seen Apple demonstrate how it will carry that idea forward since then. We saw the M2 release and the middling performance improvements that came with it, but the M3, announced during Apple's "Scary Fast" event, is the most important chip Apple has ever designed for Macs.
Although it carries the branding of the third generation of Apple silicon, it's really the second true generation. There's a lot riding on this release for Apple to prove that it can sustain its own silicon in Macs, and M3 is arriving at a time when there's fierce competition on all sides.
Second-gen Apple silicon Computing It's not often that MacBook Pros get new color options. But with this most recent update to M3 chips, the MacBook Pro will add Space Black, a color that first appeared on the iPhone, to the mix. I was shown an early preview of the new color ahead of the "Scary Fast" launch event, and I have to say: I'm smitten.
This new Space Black is not true black, of course. In truth, it's a slightly darker gray than Space Gray, which it replaces. And it's a good thing this isn't true black. Because remember, this is aluminum, and Apple isn't just slapping a coating or layer of paint on here like so many laptop manufacturers do when making true black aluminum laptops. These laptops, such as most gaming laptops or even something like the Surface Laptop, tend to scratch easily and fade over time.
Computing Apple announced an update to its MacBook Pros at today's Scary Fast event that brings the M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max under the hood. That might sound like a ho-hum generational chip refresh, especially coming just 10 months after the M2 Pro/Max models came out. But trust me -- these new MacBook Pros have become an unstoppable force, especially the new full-tilt model with the M3 Max.
The 14-inch MacBook Pro (which replaces the 13-inch MacBook Pro) will now have the option for the M3, M3 Pro, or M3 Max, while the 16-inch model gets the M3 Pro and an even more powerful M3 Max configuration. Across the board, these new M3 chips are built on the new 3nm technology, the same that's used in the new iPhone 15 models, only scaled up for the Mac. It's all about efficiency, with Apple claiming that the M3 chips provides the same performance at 30% less power.
