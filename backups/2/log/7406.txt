Responding to growing scrutiny from green activists, as well as a customer base increasingly aware of environmental issues, the Korean tech giant said the move was part of ongoing efforts to “minimize its environmental footprint and help foster more sustainable lifestyles for the Galaxy community.” Samsung said that while its new Galaxy S22 phones will be the first to incorporate repurposed ocean-bound plastics (defined as “abandoned plastic waste of all sizes that are located within 50 kilometers of shores in communities or areas where waste management is inexistent or very inefficient), the tech firm plans to do the same for its entire product lineup over time.
Samsung just announced another new phone (and two Android tablets) There’s a big problem with Samsung’s new Android tablets I’m buying a new Samsung folding phone, but not the one you’d expect “These devices will reflect our ongoing effort to eliminate single-use plastics and expand the use of other eco-conscious materials, such as recycled post-consumer material and recycled paper,” Samsung said in a release.
The Seoul-based company also drew attention to the 640,000 tons of fishing nets that are abandoned each year, with much of the material eventually trapping marine life, damaging coral reefs, and even making its way into the food chain.
“These discarded fishing nets are disrupting the delicate balance of our environment at an alarming rate,” the company said, adding that collecting and repurposing the nets “are vital first steps in keeping our oceans clean as well as preserving the planet and our collective future.” Samsung’s green efforts follow in the footsteps of other tech companies like Microsoft which last year announced the Ocean Plastic Mouse made with 20% recycled ocean plastic. Adidas has for a number of years been working along similar lines, incorporating repurposed plastic waste into some of its sneakers , while Danish watchmaker Skagen last year unveiled the Aaren Ocean watch , which uses recycled ocean plastics in the wristband, case, and dial.
Samsung’s Galaxy Unpacked event takes place on Wednesday, February 9, giving fans the first look at the company’s latest flagship phones that are set to compete with Apple’s iPhone 13 devices. To learn more about the upcoming event, Digital Trends has you covered.
Editors' Recommendations Samsung Galaxy S24: news, rumored price, release date, and more The Samsung Galaxy S24 just leaked with a few big surprises How one bad decision is ruining all of Samsung’s new phones Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 price: here’s exactly how much it costs Samsung messed up the Galaxy Z Flip 5’s most important feature News Samsung Tech for Change Tech News The Food Fight Mobile Samsung has a fresh portfolio of tablets to take on the iPad lineup. These flagship Android slates span three size formats and price points. The new Galaxy Tab S9 trio is nearly identical in heft and footprint to the Galaxy Tab S8 series, save for a minor design tweak, a new chip, and fresh color options.
The pill-shaped camera island is gone, and we now have a floating lens look that's similar to that of the Galaxy S23 series phones. Plus, there’s an eye-pleasing beige color option to pick from this year. The rest of the package is a modest iterative upgrade at best.
Galaxy Tab S9 series: specs and features Mobile Ahead of going away for a few days, I decided to swap from the phone I’d just finished reviewing to the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra, ensuring I had a great camera with me while on my break. Nothing odd about that, right? Usually, no, except I was coming from the diminutive Asus Zenfone 10, and picking up the S23 Ultra afterward felt like I'd chosen to take a 12.9-inch iPad Pro as my replacement device.
For a short while, the Galaxy S23 Ultra's enormous dimensions bordered on the laughably unmanageable. But then, it redeemed itself in the best way possible.
A truly massive size difference Mobile Samsung's next Galaxy Unpacked is almost here, and in typical Samsung fashion, the company is offering a small glimpse of what we can expect from the festivities next week.
TM Roh, the current head of Samsung's Mobile division, just shared his pre-Unpacked letter. While it's mostly marketing hype to get Samsung fans excited about next week's Unpacked event, there are a few teases that give us a small glimpse of what to expect.
