By Christian de Looper Close Cars are quickly changing. Companies are increasingly adopting new technologies to roll out fully electric models. At the same time, those companies are investing heavily in the sensors, cameras, and artificial intelligence that will eventually make cars fully self-driving.
Tesla Autopilot Tesla Enhanced Autopilot Tesla Full Self-Driving (FSD) Tesla was early to both of those things. Tesla’s entire lineup of cars is electric, and right now, it actually offers two autonomous modes: “Autopilot” and “Full Self-Driving.” But what’s the difference between the two? And what about the third option — Enhanced Autopilot? Do any of them mean you can take a nap behind the wheel? Here’s everything you need to know.
Volkswagen is launching its own self-driving car testing program in the U.S.

Tesla Autopilot Image used with permission by copyright holder Tesla Autopilot was the company’s first autonomous mode, and was introduced in 2014. It’s still the least advanced of the options, but it’s also included for free with all new Tesla cars — so it’s kind of like an added bonus.
Autopilot is designed to be used with full driver supervision, and is essentially an advanced version of cruise control. It has lane-centering and adaptive cruise control, meaning the car can both stay in the center of a lane and can slow down and speed up depending on what’s in front of it.
These are features that aren’t necessarily exclusive to Tesla. Together, they’re basically an advanced cruise control, which is on offer by other cars.
Tesla Enhanced Autopilot Tesla Enhanced Autopilot adds some features that other cars don’t have. It’s also not free — it costs $6,000.
Enhanced Autopilot allows the car to park on its own, and also has features like auto lane change, meaning the car can change lanes as it sees fit. This feature also ties into the “Navigate on Autopilot” feature, which allows the car to drive from a highway’s on-ramp to its off-ramp, theoretically without the driver’s input — though the driver should still stay aware.
It also includes Summon and Smart Summon, which allow the car to drive to you in a parking lot — no remote control necessary.
Some of these are features that you can’t really find anywhere else — though features like lane changing are set to become more common.
Tesla Full Self-Driving (FSD) Tesla Last but not least is Tesla Full Self-Driving (FSD). It’s the most advanced option, but Tesla has labeled it as a “beta,” suggesting that it’s more of a way to test the feature with real-world drivers.
Tesla debuted FSD in 2020, and has been periodically improving it ever since.
It’s the most expensive option on Tesla’s menu — it costs a hefty $15,000 upfront, or $200 per month if you prefer to pay for it as a subscription. For that money, it adds a major feature: the ability to start and stop at traffic lights and stop signs.
Tesla sees FSD as the eventual car-to-door feature, unlocking the ability to fully drive an individual from point A to point B. But it’s not quite there yet. You should still remain alert and ready to take control while using Full Self-Driving — the name is pretty misleading, as the car still can’t actually fully drive itself, and you shouldn’t expect it to.
So which mode lets you nap behind the wheel? Sorry, none of them. But that hasn’t stopped sleepy drivers from trying.

Tesla Destination Chargers vs. Superchargers: What’s the difference? Apple’s rumored car could cost the same as a Tesla Model S Elon Musk: fully loaded Tesla Semi aces 500-mile drive Tesla Cars At the Tesla AI Day 2022 event, the electric car maker revealed some key statistics about the Full Self Driving (FSD) tech that is currently still in the beta testing phase. The company divulged that the number of FSD beta testers has gone up from 2,000 last year to roughly 1,60,000 users in 2022, despite a few regulatory hiccups and incidents that raised questions about its safety.
Tesla still hasn’t provided a timeline for when the FSD package will formally exit the beta phase, but it doesn’t seem too far off. In a TED interview this year, Musk claimed that the FSD system, which now costs $15,000, will most likely be out by the end of 2022 for all customers. There are also plans for a global rollout by the end of this year, pending regulatory approval, of course.
Computing Tesla is holding its AI Day tonight, helmed by CEO Elon Musk. It's been a turbulent year for the divisive figure since the inaugural AI Day last year. Still, the focus of the event is expected to be squarely focused on robotics and AI initiatives within Tesla -- not any of Musk's personal controversies and side interests.
The topics to be discussed could range from advancements in self-driving cars to the first demo of Optimus, the company's humanoid robot project.

The dedicated robotaxi will feature a “futuristic” design and come without a steering wheel or pedals, Musk said, adding that the vehicle, which would build on the automaker’s current self-driving technology, could be “a massive driver of Tesla’s growth.” Upgrade your lifestyle Digital Trends helps readers keep tabs on the fast-paced world of tech with all the latest news, fun product reviews, insightful editorials, and one-of-a-kind sneak peeks.
