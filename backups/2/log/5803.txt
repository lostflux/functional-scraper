Nintendo What's next? Canceling your Nintendo Switch Online membership removes access to all its benefits. This includes access to online multiplayer, the NES and SNES catalogs, members-only discounts, and more. If you’re canceling because you no longer own a Switch, that’s not a big deal. But if you’re canceling because the benefits simply didn’t match up to the price tag, be sure to check the Nintendo website every few months -- the company is constantly upgrading the NSO service, and it could grow more appealing in the future.

This mode offers the convenience to play Duos on one screen, without having to hook up an additional console.
There are a few limitations to its use, but it's a great way to let friends and family experience one of the most popular free games on the market. Here's how to play Fortnite in split-screen mode.
Gaming The Nintendo Switch is one of the bestselling consoles of all time, and with the additions of the Switch Lite and the Switch OLED , that shouldn't change anytime soon. Nintendo paid a lot of attention to playing on the go when designing the Switch, and, thankfully, there are numerous ways to enjoy your system in the living room, too.
The Joy-Con grip is fine — we'll get to just how well it can work later on — but a proper controller makes the Switch feel much more like a home console. It doesn't matter if you prefer fast first-person shooters or slow narrative-driven experiences, our list of the best Nintendo Switch controllers has a gamepad for you. We'll also include a list of frequently asked controller-related questions at the bottom of this article.
Gaming The last thing anyone wants to see when booting up a game like Modern Warfare 3 to head online with your friends is to be stopped by an error. Online games are susceptible to all types of problems beyond the player's control, leading to plenty of frustration and disappointment in a possibly ruined experience. While there are more substantial issues that can completely prevent you from playing, seeing the packet burst issue is almost worse because, while it does let you play, you will experience a ton of lag that makes the game essentially unplayable. If you've been struck by a packet burst error in Modern Warfare 3, here are some possible solutions so you can get back to fragging.
How to fix packet burst errors If you spot a symbol of three squares on the left of your screen while playing Modern Warfare 3, it means you're suffering from a packet burst. This is essentially an error where something is messed up in the communication between your system and the game's servers, resulting in terrible performance. While it could be simply an issue on the server side and not related to you at all, which you can check by looking at the Modern Warfare 3 server status here, there are a few things you can do to potentially fix the issue on your end.
