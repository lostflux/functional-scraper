One of the first Tag Heuer and Porsche products to come about is the new Connected Calibre E4 Porsche Edition smartwatch.

The 100 marker and Porsche script on the bezel, along with a flash on the buttons and the Tag Heuer shield on the rubber-coated crown, are all colored in a blue lacquer recalling the Frozen Blue Metallic color used for the Porsche Taycan.
The color continues on the stitching running down the black calf-skin leather strap, which has a rubber base for added comfort and sweat resistance. Also included in the box is a simple black rubber strap if you’d prefer something a little more incognito. On the titanium case back is a heart rate sensor, with the words “Tag Heuer X Porsche” written around it, and sapphire crystal covers the 1.4-inch screen.

In addition to the special Circuit watch face that’s exclusive to this model, if you link your car to the watch then you’ll receive data from it through complications on the watch face. These show battery state and range when connected to a Taycan or hybrid cars, the remaining mileage for gas-powered cars, controls for heating and air conditioning, and the total mileage of the vehicle.
One of last year’s most luxurious smartwatches finally has Wear OS 3 Tag Heuer reinvents its luxury smartwatch with 2 stunning models Tag Heuer reimagines its beautiful, $1,800 WearOS smartwatch for 2020 To take full advantage of the Porsche-connected features you will have to own a fairly current model, including the Taycan, a 992 model 911, a 718 Boxster or Cayman, or recent Cayenne, Macan, and Panamera cars. Some of the features also require a subscription to the Porsche Connect service.

The Tag Heuer Connected Calibre E4 Porsche Edition will be released in September and cost $2,750 or 2,300 British pounds.
It follows the Carrera Porsche Chronograph Special Edition automatic chronograph, which was announced at the beginning of 2021 and the first watch to come from the Porsche and Tag Heuer partnership, and is the second special edition Calibre E4 after the recent Golf Edition.
