Earbuds Save $80 Christina Darby/ZDNET Current price: $199 Original price : $279 ZDNET's pick for best true wireless earbuds, the Bose QuietComfort II's offer 6 hours of pristine listening. Bose's top of the line Acoustic Noise Cancelling (ANC) technology provides true quiet within this pair of wireless earbuds. Using hidden microphones in the earbuds, they monitor external sound and emit an anti-sound wave to cancel out any noise other than whatever you're listening to. And when you want to tune back into your surroundings, an Aware Mode feature allows you to hear your music and surroundings at a lower level simultaneously.

Also: Amazon Fire TV Stick Comparison View now at Amazon Apple iPad (9th generation) Save $80 Jason Cipriani/ZDNET Current price: $249 Original price: $329 Apple's tried-and-true tablet, the base model iPad, is ZDNET's overall pick for best cheap tablet.
Not only does the standard price tag cover the same features you'd expect from Apple's other tablets, like iPadOS updates for years and access to the App Store -- you also don't have to pay a premium as you do for the more expensive Pro and Air models.
Review: Apple iPad (2021) review: If it's not broke, don't fix it The 9th-generation iPad was announced in the fall of 2021, and it includes an A13 Bionic processor plus more storage options. While the 10th-generation iPad was announced in 2022, ZDNET editor June Wan said the 2021 version is still a good buy -- plus it's $120 cheaper (and even more so ahead of the holiday).
Also: The best cheap tablets View now at Amazon Bose QuietComfort Ultra Wireless Earbuds Save $50 Nina Raemont/ZDNET Current price : $249 Original price : $299 The Bose QuietComfort Ultra earbuds -- the brands newest earbud launch to date -- deliver impressive noise-cancellation and a vibrant sound, all in a compact and uniquely shaped design. They feature a six-hour battery life, noise-canceling capabilities, and two immersive-audio experiences -- one for sitting or standing in place and another for moving around.
ZDNET Associate Editor Nina Raemont said the new buds are the way to go.
"For a pair of earbuds, the sound quality is top-notch, and the noise-canceling easily shields me from the loudness of car horns, train rides, and the many other sounds of New York City," Raemont wrote in her Nov. 2023 review.
 With $50 off, now's the time to score them.
Review: Forget AirPods Pro, these Bose earbuds sound better View now at Bose View now at Best Buy View now at Target Apple MacBook Air Laptop with M2 Chip Save $250 June Wan/ZDNET Current price: $1,050 Original price: $1,299 Apple's 2023 M2 MacBook Air is on sale now for $250 off -- a rare occurrence for a newer Apple device. The MacBook Air is ZDNET reviews editor June Wan's most-recommended laptop thanks to its combination of portability, performance, and price.
Read ZDNET's review: I can't recommend the 15-inch MacBook Air enough View now at Amazon Motorola Razr Save $200 June Wan/ZDNET Current price : $500 Original price: $700 ZDNET Reviews Editor June Wan says Motorola's Razr is "a big deal." The Razr is a pocket-friendly Android with dual-displays, a Snapdragon 7 Gen 1 processor, a 4,200mAh battery, and more. Just one step down from the Razr Plus, this base model packs quality and design all for under $700 -- and for even less ahead of the holiday season.
Also: The Motorola $499 foldable phone deal is the Black Friday doorbuster I've been waiting for View now at Amazon Amazon Echo Buds (2023) Save $15 Photo by Jada Jones/ZDNET Current price: $35 Original price: $50 ZDNET's pick for best budget-friendly wireless earbuds, the Amazon Echo Buds are an even better buy right now ahead of the holidays. These buds are great for work and light exercise, but keep in mind you will need to charge them frequently since their battery life runs just around five hours. The Echo Buds integrate Amazon smart assistant, Alexa, so you can create reminders, set alarms, or ask her your burning questions while wearing you're earbuds.
Review: Amazon sells these earbuds for $50 and I'm surprised they don't cost more When ZDNET's Jada Jones tried out the earbuds for herself, she called the sound "fantastic" and complimented the buds' "exciting" Alexa integration. "The Echo Buds could make a nice gift for a responsible pre-teen or an adult looking for headphones for leisure and work purposes," she wrote.
View now at Amazon Blink Outdoor 4 (4th Gen) Camera 4-Piece Set Save $100 Blink/ZDNET Current price: $180 Original price: $280 This whole-home outdoor bundle is still on sale and offers two Blink Outdoor 4 cameras, a wired floodlight camera, and mini pan-tilt camera. The set is Alexa compatible and has a two-year battery life.
View now at Amazon Apple iPad Air Save $99 with coupon Jason Cipriani/ZDNet Current price: $500 Original price: $599 Right now you can snag the iPad Air on sale with a discount of $50 (plus an extra $59 off with a coupon). This 5th generation model comes with an M1 chip, a Liquid Retina display, 64GB SSD storage, and Wi-Fi connectivity. ZDNET expert reviewer Jason Cipriani called the iPad Air "so good I almost regret buying my iPad Pro," after reviewing the tablet back in March 2022.
Review: iPad Air (2022) View now at Amazon Kindle Scribe Essentials Bundle Save $159 Kindle/ZDNET Current price: $341 Original price: $500 This Kindle model combines writing and reading capabilities. You can annotate your favorite novels, take notes during class, or brush up on your drawing skills with the Kindle Scribe Essentials Bundle. The Kindle Scribe Essentials Bundle comes with a basic pen for drawing, a fabric folio cover with magnetic attachment, and a power adapter.
Also: The best early Black Friday Kindle deals View now at Amazon Apple Watch Series 8 Save $101 Apple/ZDNET Current price: $298 Original price: $399 Though not the most up-to-date model, the Series 8 still offers great value. Like its predecessor, the Series 8 model comes in 41mm and 45mm. Its also IPX 6 water and dust resistant, contains 32 GB of storage, and offers several detailed sensors, including GPS, altimeter, blood oxygen, optical heart sensor, accelerometer, gyroscope, ambient light sensor, body temperature sensor, and high-G accelerometer. If you're okay with not having the newest model, the Series 8 makes a great purchase while discounted even further this holiday season.
Also: Apple Watch Series 9 vs. Series 8 View now at Amazon When is Black Friday 2023? Black Friday, the holiday shopping palooza of the year, falls on the same day every year -- the Friday following Thanksgiving, which is always the fourth Thursday in November. This year Black Friday falls on Nov. 24, one day after Thanksgiving on Nov. 23, 2023.
Amazon's Black Friday and holiday deals will begin Nov. 17 and will end on Nov. 27, running concurrently through the Cyber Week sales from Nov. 24-27. Cyber Monday falls on Nov. 27 this year, wrapping up the traditional Cyber Week sales ahead of December, though deals will likely linger at large retailers such as Walmart, Amazon, Best Buy, Costco and more.
ZDNET will be tracking down the best deals across a slue of popular and sought-after categories until the end of the holiday shopping season. Be sure to check back frequently while you shop to snag the best savings (we mean it, our lists are updated multiple times per week).
How did we choose these early Black Friday deals? ZDNET only writes about deals we want to buy -- devices and products we desire, need, or would recommend. Our experts looked for deals that were at least 20% off (or are hardly ever on sale), using established price comparison tools and trackers to determine whether the deal is actually on sale and how frequently it drops.
We also looked over customer reviews to find out what matters to real people who already own and use the deals we're recommending. Our recommendations may also be based on our own testing -- in addition to extensive research and comparison shopping. The goal is to deliver the most accurate advice to help you shop smarter.
What are the best Amazon deals? Amazon offers a slew of different deals ahead, during, and after the holiday season, and as its such a large retailer, it would be hard not to find the perfect gift for everyone on your list. This year the retail giant promises some of the lowest prices of the year so far on select products from popular brands like YETI, Peloton, LEGO, and LancÃ´me.
From Nov. 17-27, Amazon will offer deep discounts across categories including electronics, toys, home, fashion, beauty, and Amazon devices. Some of our favorite deals include several of ZDNET's best overall picks for robot vacuums, including the Roomba s9+, ZDNET's best Fitbit for style, the Fitbit Luxe, and ZDNET's pick for best overall noise-canceling earbuds, the Bose QuietComfort II earbuds, and their fellow competitor, the Apple Airpods Pro (2nd Gen).
Are Black Friday deals better than Amazon Prime Day events? While discounts offered during the holiday season and Prime Day often reflect similar savings, you may find that specific products or categories see more or less savings depending on the time of year. The larger upside to shopping early Black Friday deals and beyond into Cyber Week is that the holiday season is a multi-retailer event. Amazon's top competitors, such as Target, Walmart, Best Buy, and more are all capitalizing on the holiday economy and try to outdo each other by offering the best deals. The good news for you? More deals at more retailers, so be sure to shop around for the best price before hitting purchase.
What are the best early Black Friday deals right now? ZDNET's experts have been searching for early Black Friday deals across sites like Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, Newegg, and more. Here are the top deals by category we've found so far.
