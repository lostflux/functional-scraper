How did I choose these CPUs? Shopping for a gaming CPU can be overwhelming if you're unfamiliar with CPU lingo. CPUs have their own language, which can be confusing to the novice user.
When searching for a new CPU for gaming, these are some considerations that can help you find the right CPU model for your needs.
Manufacturer : For better reliability, consider who makes your CPU. Both AMD and Intel are leading manufacturers of CPUs, and they both dominate our list.
Launch date : Technology is quickly and constantly evolving, so a newer model may offer more features. Of course, you will likely pay for this with a higher price tag.
Generation : The type of generation can tell you which programming and processor the CPU uses.
Core : The CPU core count tells you how fast a CPU can operate with cores working to process several different instructions at the same time. Today's CPUs generally use multiple cores for greater performance.
Clock speed : Also known as the clock rate or frequency, the clock speed shows how many cycles per second a CPU can execute. It's measured in gigahertz (GHz).
Overclocking : Overclocking allows you to increase the clock speed of your CPU. For example, the IntelÂ® Performance Maximizer is one of the leading tools for overclocking with greater performance.
Integrated graphics : For better imaging, consider if integrated graphics are available with your CPU. This is especially important if you plan to edit and stream videos.
Another great way to find the best CPU for gaming in 2023 is to look at the PC games you intend to play. The specifications can help you buy the right CPU for your personal needs.
What is a CPU? CPU stands for "central processing unit." You can think of the CPU as the brain of your computer. It provides the basic structure and power the rest of your components need to carry out tasks and run programs.
Should I upgrade my CPU or GPU first? That depends on what issues you're having. If games are running a bit slow or having trouble launching, it's time to upgrade your graphics card since that is what controls loading in-game assets. However, if your entire PC is running slow or having trouble performing basic tasks, it's probably best to get a new CPU.
What's the difference between AMD and Intel CPUs? The difference between AMD and Intel components is similar to the difference between Windows and Mac-based computers. Both use proprietary programming languages and architecture to achieve desired results. And as such, they do NOT work together, which means that you can't buy a cheap Intel motherboard and AMD CPU and expect them to run your PC. Not only would the AMD CPU simply not fit into the motherboard, it also doesn't have the necessary programming to communicate with Intel components.
To make sure your new gaming CPU is going to work with your build, you can check out PC Part Picker , a website designed to help you create a fully compatible build with a budget for new components. You simply select what components you want to buy, and the website checks to make sure everything is compatible. And if there are any problems, it flags the issue so you know exactly what you need to change to make everything work together.
What temperature should my CPU be while gaming? A normal operating range for a CPU, while you're playing games, is 142-164 F (61-73 C). Your CPU may run a bit hotter at times, depending on graphical load and ambient temperature, but that shouldn't cause any damage.
If your CPU is running at a much hotter temperature, you may need to invest in a better cooling fan, some thermal paste to help draw excess heat to the dissipation fins, or even a liquid cooling system. There are all kinds of programs out there to help you monitor your CPU temperature, and I highly recommend using one so you can catch issues before they ruin your gaming rig.
Are there alternative CPUs worth considering? In our search for the best gaming CPUs, I came across several options that may be worth your consideration. These are some of the other CPUs I considered for 2023's best CPUs for gaming: BEST PRICE Intel Core i5-11400K - Runner-up best budget gaming CPU Here's a budget-friendly pick for Intel-based gaming rigs: the Intel Core i5-11400K.
