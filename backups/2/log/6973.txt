Editors' Recommendations The best early Keurig Black Friday deals — from $35 The best Vitamix blender Black Friday deals — from just $125 Best Ring Black Friday deals: Doorbells, security cameras, and bundles Shark Black Friday sale: Save on vacuums, air purifiers, and more Walmart just discounted this cordless vacuum and mop to $99 Deals Video Doorbells Smart Home Cleaning up dust and debris off the floor on a regular basis can be tiring, especially if you have to come home and do all that work on your own.

You also don't have to spend a ton on a good one as prices have come down and deals have made them more affordable, like this mid-range eufy Clean L50, which usually goes for $301. Walmart is running a significant discount on the eufy Clean L50 that brings it down to just $198, which is a substantial $103 discount.
Why you should buy the eufy Clean L50 For starters, one of the great selling points of the eufy Clean L50 is its self-emptying and reasonably large capacity that should let you go 60 days or so between needing to empty it, saving you a lot of hassle in the process. It can also handle both hardwood and carpeted floors just fine, so if you have a mix of floor types, you won't run into any snags or issues. Similarly, the Clean L50 has 4,000 Pa of suction power, which is good for a robot vacuum and should handle most debris and dit without issue. Interestingly, it also has a pet mode that empties itself out more regularly when your pets are in shedding season, so if you have a breed of dog that sheds a lot, this will be perfect for you.
