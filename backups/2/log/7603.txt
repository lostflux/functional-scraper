 All services arenâ€™t created equal in this regard, though, and whether you realize it or not, Peacock has a surprising number of solid action movie titles.
The Northman (2022) Ambulance (2022) Furious 7 (2015) 21 Jump Street (2012) Scott Pilgrim vs. the World (2010) Narrowing this list down to just five entries was difficult, but these five action movies represent a wide cross-section of the action films available on Peacock , and will hopefully inspire you to dig even deeper into the movies available on the service.
The Northman (2022) Robert Eggers may be best known for the horrors of The Witch , but The Northman gives this idiosyncratic director a chance to show off what he can do with a slightly bigger budget. Adapted from the same story that Hamlet was eventually adapted from, the movie follows a Viking whose father is betrayed. He spends his entire life planning to take revenge on the man who killed his father and stole his mother.
3 action movies on Netflix you need to watch in November This 2019 Liam Neeson action movie is popular on Netflix. Hereâ€™s why 3 underrated movies on Peacock you need to watch in November When the moment for that revenge eventually comes, things get more complicated than he ever could have imagined.
The Northman features astonishing moments of action, as well as a great central performance from Alexander SkarsgÃ¥rd.
Ambulance (2022) Michael Bay can be a bit extreme for some tastes (he is, after all, the inventor of â€œ Bayhem â€œ), but Ambulance plays to all of the directorâ€™s strengths. Following the crew of a heist as it goes wrong and they are forced to drive an ambulance all over the city, Ambulance goes at 100 miles an hour from its very first scene.
In spite of its relatively modest scale, though, the movie never feels anything less than totally thrilling, and itâ€™s also got plenty of comedy. Jake Gyllenhaal is absolutely insane as one of the two brothers at the movieâ€™s center, and heâ€™s perfectly matched by Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, who just wants to get home to his family.
Furious 7 (2015) In retrospect, it seems like the Fast & Furious series probably should have ended with Furious 7.
 This movie is the exact right balance of deeply sincere and utterly absurd, and it was also the seriesâ€™ farewell to Paul Walker, who died in the middle of the filmâ€™s production.
Ultimately, though, what makes Furious 7 work is that it gives each of its characters something interesting to do, and climaxes with Vin Diesel stomping his enemies to death. The movie is not exactly the epitome of realistic action, but thatâ€™s always been the appeal of this series.
21 Jump Street (2012) Not exactly beholden to the original 21 Jump Street,<\/em>\u00a0we have to say that the movie reboot with Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill doesn't look too bad. Of course, we do understand if you hate this because really how do you replace Richard Greco?<\/p>\r\n One thing that is nice about the movie remake is that they're going for more of the comedy route than the \"after-school-special\" path that the original Fox show had.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n Besides, Ron Swanson is the police chief and who doesn't love Ron Swanson? Yes, we know his name isn't really Ron Swanson, but come on.<\/p>\r\n 21 Jump Street<\/em>\u00a0hits theaters on March 16, 2012.<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.digitaltrends.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/12\/Jonah-Hill-and-Channing-Tatum-in-21-Jump-Street-2012-Movie-Image-e1324345882332.jpeg?fit=720%2C720&p=1","source":"https:\/\/content.jwplatform.com\/videos\/8YFixkD9.mp4","duration":150}}}) .catch(function(err) { console.error(err.message) }); }); The epitome of an action comedy, 21 Jump Street follows two cops who are forced to go undercover in a high school together. Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill turn out to be a surprisingly excellent comedic duo, and there are enough shootouts here to satisfy anyone who came for the action.
The movieâ€™s core joke, which is that Jonah Hillâ€™s dweeby cop would be the cool one, and Tatumâ€™s jock cop would be more of an outcast, works like a charm, but both Hill and Tatum get plenty of opportunities to prove that theyâ€™re two of our funniest actors.
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World (2010) No one does an action movie quite like Edgar Wright. An adaptation from a graphic novel of the same name, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World tells the story of Scott, a bassist in a Toronto rock band who finds himself battling a barrage of superpowered ex-boyfriends after he meets Ramona Flowers.
Barbie â€˜s Michael Cera is perfectly cast in the central role, but what really makes Scott Pilgrim sing is Wrightâ€™s devotion to the video game aesthetics of the comic the movie is based on. This movie has incredible amounts of style, and itâ€™s that style that carries the viewer from set piece to set piece.
Editors' Recommendations 5 bad 2000s action movies that you still need to watch right now 3 action movies on Prime Video you need to watch in November The best movies on Peacock right now (November 2023) 3 action movies on Paramount+ you need to watch in November This action war movie is popular on Netflix. Hereâ€™s why you should watch it Action Peacock Entertainment Action movies have been around since the dawn of cinema, but the action genre as we know it came to be during the '70s and '80s. The formula for action movies hasn't changed much in the decades since then. While many standard action flicks go for a single lead, like Bruce Willis in Die Hard, Sylvester Stallone in Rambo, and Arnold Schwarzenegger in the Terminator films, action comedies tend to work best when pairing up two stars as duos in buddy flicks.
The best duos in action movies are almost never one-off occurrences. If something worked well the first time, then you can count on Hollywood to revisit the well again and again. But we're okay with a few more sequels if it means that our choices for the five best duos in action movies can team up one last time.
5. Martin Lawrence and Will Smith Entertainment Hulu's library of films is an impressive mix of originals and hits from popular companies like Disney, 20th Century Studios, Warner Bros., Searchlight Pictures, and Neon. This fall, Hulu has added new thrillers and horror films for the Halloween season. However, there are plenty of action, comedy, and dramas to watch if horror is not your thing.
From 2023 horror films like The Boogeyman and A Haunting in Venice to classic romantic comedies such as Sleepless in Seattle, these films represent some of the best movies on Hulu. Below, we selected five movies streaming on Hulu that are perfect to watch in the fall.
The Boogeyman (2023) Entertainment The best sci-fi movies often push the boundaries of what's possible to depict on the big screen by taking on complex fictional concepts that are often rooted in reality. Recent films in the category embrace the intersection between science, philosophy, and humanity, and use mind-blowing visuals and cutting-edge cinematography to bolster filmmakers' ambitious efforts.
From the visually stunning and otherworldly story told in Dune to the mind-bending mix of existentialism and the multiverse in Everything Everywhere All at Once, the greatest science fiction movies from the past five years represent the best that the genre has to offer. With so much to explore in the genre, these are the few standouts that should be considered essential viewing for fans.
