On desktop and mobile, the ‚ÄúPlay Now‚Äù option will appear for games that are on a supported cloud gaming service.
No console üéÆ? No problem. Now you can search and launch video games in the cloud instantly with Google. ‚òÅÔ∏è Available in the U.S., in English for mobile and desktop.
pic.twitter.com/Zpj5DVBCkD &mdash; Google (@Google) December 13, 2022 Through our own testing today, this option was showing up for games like Halo Infinite that are on Xbox Game Pass , as well as titles like Control: Ultimate Edition that are only on Amazon Luna.
 If a game happens to be on both, like Windjammers 2 , then the option to play the game on either service will show up.
On desktop, the Play Now section appears right under the game title and featured images on the right side of the search results. On mobile, we had to scroll past the People also ask section. multiple search results, and the People also search for section to find the Play Now option.

One of Game Pass‚Äô best titles leaves PC on August 15 and you don‚Äôt want to miss it 5 underrated Xbox Game Pass games you should play while you still can One of my favorite 2022 games just came to Xbox Game Pass, and you need to try it It is a bit of an awkward addition, considering it‚Äôs releasing a little too late to benefit Google‚Äôs proprietary cloud gaming service. While previous tests for this feature included Google Stadia , that service did not show up for us during our own testing with Stadia-supported games like Doom Eternal.
 That‚Äôs likely because Google announced that it plans to shut Stadia down in January 2023. That is a shame, because a feature like this really would‚Äôve brought a lot more attention to the struggling cloud gaming platform. Although it‚Äôs not going to attract people to Google‚Äôs own cloud gaming service, it‚Äôs still a helpful addition for those searching for games that are included in the Xbox Game Pass or Amazon Luna subscriptions.
According to Google, this feature should now be available to everyone using Google Search on desktop or mobile in the United States.

Gaming High on Life is out now on Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. The adventure will likely take you around 10 to 15 hours to beat, but you might want to plan to spend an extra 82 minutes in it. That's because you can watch the 1994 cult classic Tammy and the T-Rex in its entirety within the game, if you so desire.
The central plot of High on Life revolves around a three-eyed alien named Gene who winds up crashing on the hero's couch. While he earns his keep by coordinating bounties and giving players upgrades, he's a bit of a mooch who spends the game watching TV. He very specifically seems to love Tammy and the T-Rex. If you've got time to kill, you can watch the entire movie in-game, start to finish.
Gaming Samsung is expanding its Gaming Hub by adding the cloud-based streaming app to some 2021 smart TV models starting next week. The service itself is getting more enticing, as the app will soon support 4K cloud game streaming at 60 frames per second (fps) on select games via Nvidia GeForce Now.
Samsung Gaming Hub launched this summer on the company's line of 2022 smart TVs. At launch, the service allowed TV owners to stream games on their TV through cloud services like Xbox Game Pass and Amazon Luna. With its latest update, Samsung has made it clear that the service is only growing as it looks to retroactively put it in front of even more smart TV users.
