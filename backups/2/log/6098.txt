But if you’re also looking to earn every trophy the game has to offer to earn the coveted Platinum, you’ve probably noticed a bronze trophy called “Home Run!” that asks you to run the bases at Big Apple Ballers Stadium. You don’t have to hit a homer to score this trophy, but you do need to take a lap around the bases, so we’ll tell you where to find Big Apple Ballers Stadium below so you can start living out your baseball legend dreams.
Where to find Big Apple Ballers Stadium Big Apple Ballers Stadium is located in Downtown Brooklyn, which can be found at the very bottom of the southeast portion of the map. While it’s a little difficult to make out the stadium on the map, you’ll definitely be able to recognize it in-game as you swing closer, as it’s quite a large stadium located not too far from the amusement park you visit as part of the story.
Sony Of course, finding the stadium is only part of the equation for getting the Home Run! trophy. Once you reach the stadium, make your way to home plate and then run the bases in a counter-clockwise fashion (home, first, second, third, home) as if you’d just hit a home run.
Sony When you’ve touched all of the bases in the proper order, you’ll earn the Home Run! trophy.

Comic Book Movies How-To Guides Marvel Sony Sony PlayStation Sony PlayStation 5 Gaming Everyone knows the iconic Spider-Man suit. The red-and-blue spandex uniform has been iterated on and altered hundreds of times over the course of decades, leading to some similar and some very different designs. Spider-Man 2 introduces Venom and the symbiote suit to the mix as a plot point, but there are almost 70 total suits from various comics, shows, and movies to unlock and wear between Peter pParker and Miles Morales. Unlocking them is one thing, but changing between them, and their new styles, is another. With this guide, you will be able to change your spider style as fast as our heroes when duty calls.
How to change suits Once you've snagged your first additional suit and used some Tokens to unlock it, changing between them is a breeze. Simply open your menu, go to the Suits tab, and highlight the one you want to wear. If you want to switch between Peter and Miles, simply hit L2 or R2 to cycle between the Spider-Men since each has their own unique set of suit options. Press X on the suit you want to wear and -- bam! -- your Spider-Man is now decked out in a new style. However, that's not all. Many suits have additional styles you can unlock by spending some Tech Parts. These give you three additional color options for that specific suit to further customize your look.
Gaming There is no shortage of collectibles to gather and activities to do in Spider-Man 2. From photo-ops to Prowler Stashes, the map is filled with icons showing you where to go to find just about anything you need. One thing that isn't marked on your map, however, is a very special collectible for Miles Morales. This isn't required for any specific quest, and won't give you any XP, but it does reward you with the Just Let Go trophy that is necessary if you want to get the coveted Platinum trophy. With no clues as to where to find this tiny science trophy on the massive New York map, you could spend hours swinging around looking. Instead, we'll show you exactly where to look so you can check this trophy off your list.
How to get the Just Let Go trophy The science trophy we're looking for is in the southern part of the Financial District on a church. The exact location can be seen above, but the church itself is impossible to miss once you're in the area. When you reach the church, climb up onto the roof behind the main steeple and look up at the small balcony running around it. If you're close enough, you will see the small white circle indicating that there's something you can interact with there.
Gaming Peter Parker has had a hard life. He was orphaned by his parents as a child and raised by his caring Aunt May and Uncle Ben, only for Ben to be killed in an act that would shape Spider-Man's entire philosophy as a hero. Things only get worse during the events of the first act of Insomniac's Spider-Man 2 as Aunt May is tragically killed as well, leaving Peter with no more true parental figures. Peter hasn't forgotten all his caring aunt and uncle have done for him, and if you can find their gravesite, he will pay them respect, as well as earn you a Trophy. It's a big graveyard, though, and their site isn't marked on the map. Here's where Uncle Ben and Aunt May's graves are located in Spider-Man 2.
How to find Aunt May and Uncle Ben's graves The graveyard is located at the most-northeastern point on the New York map in Harlem. If you have unlocked fast travel in this district, you can warp almost directly to the spot. Once in the graveyard, go forward down the middle into the open field. You might spot Mile's father's grave first. May and Ben's graves are directly to the right of that.
