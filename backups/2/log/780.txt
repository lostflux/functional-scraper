Originally, the service wasn’t required for online play at all and rewarded subscribers with extra discounts and free monthly games. Once the PlayStation 4 generation began, it was required for online play, but still offered those same benefits.
Now, PS Plus is divided into three different tiers of subscriptions. The basic tier, PS Plus Essential, still gets three games per month added, while the Extra and Premium tiers will have a varying number of games added to their catalogs. With hundreds of games already and more coming and going all the time, even the most dedicated gamer won’t be able to play everything on offer. To help you get the most bang for your buck, and so that no hidden gems fly under your radar, here are all the best games to play on PS Plus Essential, Extra, and Premium right now.
Best PS Plus Essential games As is usually the case, everyone with the lowest tier of PS Plus gets three games this month, two with PlayStation 5 versions and one with a PS4 version. Here’s what you can play this month: Save on everything from laptops and tablets, to coffee makers and air purifiers, and a whole host of Apple tech like iPad, Apple Watch and even the latest M3 MacBooks, as well as smart home essentials like the Amazon Echo and smart bulbs.

These games cycle in and out every month, though you never know how many will be added or removed at a given time.

Playing as a couple on the verge of divorce who are turned into their daughter’s toys, you and your partner will need to work together to navigate the world at your new scale to try and get back to normal. And when we say need to work together, we mean it. Unlike many other co-op games, teamwork is required here since each player has a different skill or ability in each segment of the game that can’t fully function without the other player’s. It may be a little long, but it is never boring since the mechanics change so frequently.

This game really shows what the new hardware can do in all aspects. The graphics are on the level of an animated feature comet to life, the frame rate is rock solid, and the resolution is beautiful and even offers ray tracing, but the real showpiece are the rifts. The whole concept of this title is that the dimensions are falling apart, allowing Ratchet, and new protagonist Rivet, to seamlessly move from one dimension to the next. It is a trick so amazing that you may not believe it’s real. Oh, and it also helps that the game itself is a fantastically fun shooter with tons of personality and creative weapons and enemies.

This is where car combat really started, and it’s arguably still the best. Each character you play as has a unique story as they attempt to win the titular tournament with the promise of any wish being granted upon victory. However, those wishes are never quite granted in the way the characters expect, making it a treat to play through the game to see how their words are twisted.

Don't worry about building up a backlog, because we're not sure when you'll get another opportunity to purchase the video games included in this sale for this cheap. The discounted titles cover all genres, so there's surely something that will catch your attention, but you'll have to push through with the transaction immediately because we're not sure how long these bargains will last.
What to buy in Best Buy's PS5 games flash sale The cheapest PlayStation 5 games in the flash sale are all available for just $10 each -- Japanese criminal underworld RPG Gaming If you don't have a PlayStation Plus (PS Plus) membership, you're only not getting the full benefits of your PlayStation 5 (or 4). PS Plus lets you play online multiplayer, as well as get free games and other bonuses. Sony recently revamped their PS Plus subscription method, so you now have the option of three different tiers: Essential, Extra and Premium. We'll go over all of these options below. When you've figured out which one you want, check out or list of the best PlayStation Plus deals at the bottom of this article. You can start your PS Plus membership for as low as $5.
What is PlayStation Plus? Along with online multiplayer and other in-game network features, a PlayStation Plus Essential membership grants you access to exclusive discounts and other promotions. Perhaps the most notable benefit of PlayStation Plus is that every month, Sony gives subscribers one PlayStation 5 and two PlayStation 4 games that are free to download. You have one month to add these free PlayStation Plus games to your library.
Gaming Picking a console is a big decision. They're not cheap, so unless gaming is your passion, you probably don't want to spend the cash to grab all three of the major ones. That's why we've collected the best prices on every version of the three major consoles. Below you'll find Xbox Series S and X deals, PlayStation 5 deals, and Nintendo Switch deals (on all the various versions). We've listed the best prices at the major retailers, and any deals we could find among them. Once you've grabbed your console, check out the best video games deals to go along with them.
Xbox Series S deals -- starting at $280 The Xbox Series S is the less powerful but cheaper option out of the newest generation Xbox line. When comparing the Xbox Series S versus the Xbox Series X, the Series S takes a hit in all the component categories. That means it's not quite as fast. But if you're not hung up on getting the optimal performance out of your system, you'll actually notice very few differences. The two biggest ones are the Series S's inability to play in 8K, and its lack of a disc drive. Most people don't even have 8K TVs, so that shouldn't be an issue. If you're alright with downloading all of your games straight to the console's memory (and you have a separate DVD or Blu-Ray player), the Series S will work fine. It's quite a bit smaller anyway, and easier to fit on a shelf.
