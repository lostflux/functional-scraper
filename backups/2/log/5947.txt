The best part about the game’s expansion to the service is that it will support ray tracing.
The company said in a blog post on Thursday that A Plague Tale: Requiem will support ray-traced effects for GeForce Now users who are RTX 3080 and Priority members, even if they don’t own a powerful gaming PC.
 The game can even be streamed on Mac and mobile phones, which normally wouldn’t support large games otherwise. Take a look at the video Nvidia shared two weeks ago demonstrating the game’s performance enhanced by ray tracing.
Asobo and Focus Entertainment’s forthcoming sequel also supports Nvidia DLSS 3.0, but the company will need to upgrade its servers with RTX 4000 graphics cards in order for it to function. Once it does, it will ramp up the game’s performance to up to four times faster than its native rendering. Nvidia tested the DLSS 3.0 performance on Cyberpunk 2077 , boosting its frame rate from 30 frames per second (fps) to almost 100fps.
A Plague Tale: Requiem is one of 25 games heading to GeForce Now, and one of 12 games to launch on the service on the same day it does on other platforms throughout October. Those games include Scorn , Warhammer 40,000: Shootas, Blood & Teef, Victoria 3, LEGO Bricktales, PC Building Simulator 2, Asterigos: Curse of the Stars, and Faith: An Unholy Trinity.

Focus Showcase | A Plague Tale: Requiem - Release Date & Extended Gameplay Trailer Gaming With 2022’s gaming lineup looking a little anemic after Starfield’s big delay, A Plague Tale: Requiem is now a “main stage” game. While it doesn’t have an official release date yet, it's supposed to launch this year during a notably slow season for games. If that holds true, the “AA” stealth action sequel will get a holiday season spotlight that’s usually reserved for bigger budget games with franchise star power behind them.
A Plague Tale: Requiem - "End of Innocence" Gameplay Trailer | Xbox & Bethesda Games Showcase 2022 Computing Ray tracing is the lighting tech that defines the look of many modern AAA games. Demanding as it is, most of the best gaming desktops come with ray tracing-capable hardware, allowing you to experience the most graphically demanding technique games currently have access to.
Just because a game has great graphics doesn't mean it's a great showcase of ray tracing, though. For example, Hitman 3's ray tracing update was a disappointment. We catered our list toward games that best showcase ray tracing, so you can use them for bragging rights or just to see what your PC is capable of.
