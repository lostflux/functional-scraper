The server-based community plans to roll out a new feature to its Clyde chatbot next week, which will be available to a select number of servers with Discord alpha users. These testers will be able to use Clyde in an assistant fashion, having it start a thread for a group of your friends to hang out, recommend playlists, access GIFs, and more, according to a recent blog post.

 Snapchat also recently announced an AI chatbot called My AI for its app.
However, the Clyde chatbot inundated with AI has the potential to have the same issues and limitations as other products that have been using language models provided by ChatGPT’s parent company, OpenAI. The biggest example has been Microsoft’s Bing Chat , which released its AI chatbot in February. Users dealt with the depressed and unhinged responses generated from the chat in its early preview days, which led Microsoft to put restrictions on the turn limits in conversations. Those limits are now being lifted , apparently after some work on the brand’s part.
GPT-4 Turbo is the biggest update since ChatGPT’s launch ChatGPT: the latest news, controversies, and tips you need to know ChatGPT’s new upgrade finally breaks the text barrier Discord is aware of the potential for its ChatGPT-based chatbot to go down a similar road and recommends that users not rely on Clyde for “advice, Discord support, or safety issues.” Users will also receive a warning when opting in to use the AI-updated Clyde for the first time.
Additionally, the company is aware that due to the knowledgeable demographic of its users, there is the potential for them to attempt jailbreaking the language models and force Clyde to say bad things or break terms of service. This is one of the main reasons the company has done a slow rollout starting with alpha users with whom it can ask for feedback, Anjney Midha, Discord’s platform ecosystem head, said in an interview with The Verge.
Clyde isn’t the only area where Discord is leveraging OpenAI’s technology. The company is also rolling out AutoMod AI, which leverages OpenAI technology to automatically moderate messages while understanding the context of the conversation. Discord is rolling this feature out to a “limited number of servers” now.
Discord is also adding AI-generated conversation summaries to catch you up on long threads, as well as Avatar Remix, which allows you to remix avatars for users in your server using generative AI.
Editors' Recommendations The world responds to the creator of ChatGPT being fired by his own company Bing Chat just beat a security check to stop hackers and spammers This powerful ChatGPT feature is back from the dead — with a few key changes Meta is reportedly working on a GPT-4 rival, and it could have dire consequences GPT-4: how to use the AI chatbot that puts ChatGPT to shame Artificial Intelligence Tech News Computing The Zoom video-calling app has just added its own “AI Companion” assistant that integrates artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMs) from ChatGPT maker OpenAI and Facebook owner Meta. The tool is designed to help you catch up on meetings you missed and devise quick responses to chat messages.
Zoom’s developer says the AI Companion “empowers individuals by helping them be more productive, connect and collaborate with teammates, and improve their skills.” Computing Ever since the first generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools exploded onto the tech scene, there have been questions over where they’re getting their data and whether they’re harvesting your private data to train their products. Now, ChatGPT maker OpenAI could be in hot water for exactly these reasons.
According to TechCrunch, a complaint has been filed with the Polish Office for Personal Data Protection alleging that ChatGPT violates a large number of rules found in the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). It suggests that OpenAI’s tool has been scooping up user data in all sorts of questionable ways.
Computing Generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools like ChatGPT have gotten a bad rep recently, but Google is apparently trying to serve up something more positive with its next project: an AI that can offer helpful life advice to people going through tough times.
If a fresh report from The New York Times is to be believed, Google has been testing its AI tech with at least 21 different assignments, including “life advice, ideas, planning instructions and tutoring tips.” The work spans both professional and personal scenarios that users might encounter.
