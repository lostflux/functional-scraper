Why trust us? All the best Walmart laptop Black Friday deals happening right now By Noah McGraw Close Digital Trends Walmart has started its Black Friday deals early this year, so there are a ton of cheap laptops you can buy right now. There are student laptops, gaming laptops, and laptops in between. We’ve pulled out some of our favorites, including the best Black Friday laptop deal currently available at Walmart. Be sure to compare this to our list of general Black Friday laptop deals to see how it compares, as Best Buy, Amazon and individual retailers have some great deals too.
Best Walmart laptop Black Friday deal More Walmart laptop Black Friday deals we love Best Walmart laptop Black Friday deal MSI Our favorite Black Friday laptop deal available at Walmart is this substantial discount on the MSI GE Series Raider. It’s a 17-inch gaming laptop with a nice $599 discount. It normally sells for $1,599, but right now it’s down to just $1,000 even. That’s definitely not bad for a gaming laptop. Let’s dive into the specs to illustrate why this is our favorite.
The 17-inch MSI Raider has a screen worthy of some gorgeous games. While it’s only 1080p, it has a snappy refresh rate of 144Hz, so you can max out frame rate on your games without dropping any. A screen that big leaves room for a nice keyboard, and this model comes with a full one, number pad and all.
Save on everything from laptops and tablets, to coffee makers and air purifiers, and a whole host of Apple tech like iPad, Apple Watch and even the latest M3 MacBooks, as well as smart home essentials like the Amazon Echo and smart bulbs.
Let’s look at the components. The processor is an Intel Core i7, which isn’t crazy but can certainly handle modern games. It has an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 GPU, which is a great starting place for any gaming rig. It has 16GB of memory, which is enough to play pretty much any game, but if you want to start multitasking you might want to upgrade. It also comes with a 1TB SSD, which is a necessity in a world where most modern games are about 100GB downloads.
More Walmart laptop Black Friday deals we love HP Here are a few other options currently available at Walmart. They include a ridiculously cheap generic laptop, some HP options and some more gaming laptop deals. Just because these deals are labeled “early Black Friday” doesn’t mean they will stick around until the actual shopping holiday starts, so if you see something you like, grab it today.

Also, if you're not sure of where to start, you should check out our list of best Lenovo laptops for some good options.

And, if you want something with an RTX 4090 on a budget, then the AMD version is probably the cheapest for Lenovo.
