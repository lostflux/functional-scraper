Yes, it’s a somewhat peculiar problem, and troublesome, too, especially considering that it could also affect the proper operation of the BMW’s digital car key. But the good news is that Apple’s release of iOS 17.
1.1 on Tuesday finally resolves it.
Apple launched the iPhone 15 in late September, so it’s taken a while for the company to get around to sorting it out. An internal memo issued by the company and seen by MacRumors in late October said the issue occurred when charging an iPhone 15 , iPhone 15 Plus , iPhone 15 Pro, or iPhone 15 Pro Max in some BMWs and Toyota Supra vehicles.
How I use my Apple Watch and iPhone to manage my diabetes This iPhone 15 and iPhone 14 camera test is closer than I expected 4 AI features I want in my next iPhone The latest iPhone update also put right an issue where the lock screen weather widget would show a file icon instead of one for snow.
Here are Apple’s notes accompanying the iOS 17.1.1 update for the iPhone: This update provides bug fixes for your iPhone including: – In rare circumstances, Apple Pay and other NFC features may become unavailable on iPhone 15 models after wireless charging in certain cars – Weather Lock Screen widget may not correctly display snow If updates for your iPhone aren’t delivered automatically, you’ll need to complete the process manually. This can be done simply by selecting Settings, then General, then Software Update. You’ll then see information explaining what the update brings. Finally, you can choose whether to update now or overnight.
Editors' Recommendations It looks like the iPhone 16 will get a big design upgrade The iPhone is getting out of control I love Apple, but it’s totally wrong about iMessage and RCS I figured out how to protect my iPhone without an ugly case The iPhone’s futuristic satellite tech isn’t coming to Android any time soon Apple Apple iPhone Tech News Mobile iPhone 14 Plus (left) and iPhone 15 Plus Andy Boxall / Digital Trends If you’re reading this article, chances are high that you keep pretty up-to-date with modern technology, including smartphones like Apple’s iPhone. You may upgrade your phone every few years, or — if you’re like me — you might even upgrade every year.
Mobile The iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max have an all-new titanium body, which is the standout feature from a design perspective. However, another hardware-related feature that's even more noteworthy for these models — and future iPhones over time — is the new Action button.
The Action button replaces the ring/silent switch on the left side of the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max. You can assign one shortcut to the button through the Settings app, such as activating and using the Camera app or turning on the phone's flashlight. To assign the button, go into the Settings app on your supported iPhone. From there, choose the Action Button, then toggle to your selection. It's that simple.
Mobile As an avid Apple fan, I was surprised when I received the Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 FE for review and found myself loving it. Could Samsung continue to impress me? That's what I wanted to find out when I received the Galaxy S23 FE. This "fan edition" smartphone, which we just ran through its paces in our Samsung Galaxy S23 FE review, offers many of the same features as the other Galaxy S23 models, but at a slightly lower price.
My handset of choice has always been the latest iPhone Pro. This usually means purchasing the Pro Max model, which I did again this year with the iPhone 15 Pro Max. I didn't expect the Galaxy S23 FE to match up to my new iPhone, as the Apple device is double the price and offers much better specs.
