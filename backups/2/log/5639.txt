Why trust us? Sony Alpha 7R V mirrorless camera is $400 off for Black Friday By Aaron Mamiit Close Image used with permission by copyright holder If you’re thinking about getting a new mirrorless camera from this year’s Black Friday deals , here’s an offer that you shouldn’t pass up — the Sony Alpha 7R V for $3,500, following a $400 discount from Best Buy on its sticker price of $3,900. It’s still not affordable with the savings, but this mirrorless camera will quickly prove that it’s worth every single penny. We’re not sure how much time remains before its price goes back to normal though, so if you don’t want to miss out on what we think will turn out to be one of the most popular Sony camera Black Friday deals , you know what to do — add it to your cart and check out immediately.
Why you should buy the Sony Alpha 7R V mirrorless camera Among the benefits of a mirrorless camera is they’re less bulky because of the absence of the mirror found in a DSLR, so instead of an optical viewfinder, you’ll compose your shots on an electronic viewfinder or an LCD screen, according to our digital camera buying guide.
 You’ll get these with the Sony Alpha 7R V and more, as it’s capable of recording 8K 24p/25p and 4K 60p/50p video, and taking 61MP photos. It’s powered by the Bionz XR image processor, which can process massive amounts of image data while reducing latency.
Making the Sony Alpha 7R V mirrorless camera stand out, however, is its AI processing capabilities that enable accurate subject recognition for real-time autofocus. It also offers precise image stabilization, precise and versatile control over a compatible flash unit, and support for the lossless RAW format.
Save on everything from laptops and tablets, to coffee makers and air purifiers, and a whole host of Apple tech like iPad, Apple Watch and even the latest M3 MacBooks, as well as smart home essentials like the Amazon Echo and smart bulbs.
Photography enthusiasts and creative professionals who are on the hunt for Black Friday camera deals may want to go for the Sony Alpha 7R V mirrorless camera. Usually $3,900, it’s currently available from Best Buy Black Friday deals for $3,500, for savings of $400. The discount isn’t exactly eye-catching, but you should treat it as a bonus when purchasing this powerful device, and you can spend it on buying lenses. If you’re interested in the lowered price of the Sony Alpha 7R V mirrorless camera, then don’t waste any more time — proceed with the transaction as soon as possible.
Editors' Recommendations Sony camera Black Friday deals: Save on camera body and lenses Nikon Black Friday deals: Save on camera bodies and lenses Best Polaroid Black Friday deals: Save on cameras and accessories Sony A7 III mirrorless camera is $635 off in Walmart’s Black Friday Sale Sony Alpha a7 III deal: Save $300 on the popular mirrorless camera Deals Sony Deals There are a lot of great Best Buy Black Friday deals going on right now, and whether you're looking for TVs, laptops, or even headphones, there's a little something for everybody. Of course, many folks may not realize that Best Buy has some fantastic deals on high-end photography gear, such as this Sony Alpha a7 III mirrorless camera. While it usually goes for a whopping $2,200, Best Buy had brought it down to $1,900, and while that relatively doesn't seem like much, you could always spend the $300 savings on a new lens.
Why you should buy the Sony Alpha a7 III The Sony Alpha a7 III is a camera with so much tech that it might as well be three different cameras. It has excellent dynamic range, low-light performance, and high-speed performance, and the full-frame sensors make the images look absolutely stunning. Interestingly, the a7 III manages to do an excellent job at both low and high ISOs, the latter of which can go as high as 51,200 non-boosted, which, granted, adds a lot of noise, but noise reduction helps with that. As for the video, well, sadly, it's not as impressive, at least in terms of advancements in image quality, and while it can do 8-bit 4K at 30 frames per second, it's no longer ahead of the pack in that regard, like the Panasonic Lumix GH5 is with its 400Mbps 10-bit codec and 60-fps 4K.
Deals As we barrel toward Black Friday, the early deals keep cropping up, and some of these discounts on the best tech are as good as we’ve ever seen. Among the impressive Amazon Black Friday deals, we’re seeing this standout: Right now, get $100 off the Canon EOS M50 Mirrorless Vlogging Camera Kit. It’s everything you need in a semi-pro digital camera -- from the best pics to your vlogging needs -- now just $549, down from its regular price of $649. Snap this deal up while you can.
The Canon EOS M50 Mirrorless is as talented a camera you’ll find in this range, and it’s super versatile too. It can shoot video in 4K and has hugely impressive photo capabilities, even in low light. Also, for ease of use, there’s a swivel touchscreen, which can really help you set up and review your shots. Additionally, it's loaded with shooting modes, so switching up shooting modes is as simple as touching a button. But with this deal, you don’t just get the camera, but a whole kit. There’s the camera, an EF-M 15-45mm lens, tripod to set up your steady shots or video recording station, and a backpack.
Deals While Thanksgiving is still a few weeks off, we’re seeing some amazing Black Friday deals in anticipation of the big event, including some phenomenal Black Friday camera deals. In fact, right now at Best Buy, you can get $100 off this Canon EOS Rebel T7 DSL Camera Bundle.

That’s everything you need to start shooting professional-level photographs and video, all for one low price.
This is an all-around great starter camera package that's ideal for budding photographers and hobbyists alike. The Canon EOS series is renowned as both easy to use and versatile in terms of pro-grade, customizable options when you’re ready to take those steps forward and get better acquainted with photography. Not only that, but this package includes a shoulder bag to help you take your photo gear everywhere you go, as well as an extra lens to provide greater variety as you hone your skills.
