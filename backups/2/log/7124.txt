As reported by Digital Trends on Monday, some owners of the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max have taken to online forums to express concerns that their new iPhone is heating up way beyond what seems normal, and certainly to a greater extent than their previous iPhone when performing the same or similar tasks.
Some have speculated that the issue is caused by the phone’s new A17 Pro chip, which is Apple and TSMC’s first 3nm processor. But high-profile analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, a man better known for sharing insider information on upcoming iPhone designs than comments on issues like this, claims the matter is probably due to factors such as Apple’s use of a titanium frame in the new Pro phones, which Kuo says affects thermal efficiency.
How I use my Apple Watch and iPhone to manage my diabetes This iPhone 15 and iPhone 14 camera test is closer than I expected 4 AI features I want in my next iPhone Writing in a Medium post on Tuesday, Kuo explained: “My survey indicates that the iPhone 15 Pro series overheating issues are unrelated to TSMC’s advanced 3nm node. The primary cause is more likely the compromises made in the thermal system design to achieve a lighter weight, such as the reduced heat dissipation area and the use of a titanium frame, which negatively impacts thermal efficiency.” The analyst suggested that the tech giant will deal with the issue via software updates, but noted that if it goes too far then chip performance could be affected.
“It’s expected that Apple will address this through software updates, but improvements may be limited unless Apple lowers processor performance,” Kuo said, before warning that if Apple fails to properly address the issue, “it could negatively impact shipments over the product life cycle of the iPhone 15 Pro series.” Apple has yet to publicly acknowledge what increasingly looks like a real issue for the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max, though it’s certain that behind the scenes its engineers are taking a close look. Puzzling many people will be how such an issue makes it through the device’s intensive testing phase, though it’s possible Apple registered it but deemed the heat levels acceptable.
The tech giant says on its website that it’s normal for an iPhone to heat up while performing certain tasks, for example, setting it up for the first time, restoring it from a backup, and streaming high-quality video. But forum comments indicate that there may be something more serious going on. Pressure is growing for Apple to confirm the situation soon.
Editors' Recommendations It looks like the iPhone 16 will get a big design upgrade The iPhone is getting out of control I love Apple, but it’s totally wrong about iMessage and RCS I figured out how to protect my iPhone without an ugly case No, you really don’t need the iPhone 15 News Apple Apple Events and Announcements Apple iPhone Tech News Mobile The iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max have an all-new titanium body, which is the standout feature from a design perspective. However, another hardware-related feature that's even more noteworthy for these models — and future iPhones over time — is the new Action button.
The Action button replaces the ring/silent switch on the left side of the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max. You can assign one shortcut to the button through the Settings app, such as activating and using the Camera app or turning on the phone's flashlight. To assign the button, go into the Settings app on your supported iPhone. From there, choose the Action Button, then toggle to your selection. It's that simple.
Mobile Apple’s latest iPhone update has addressed an irksome bug that caused Apple Pay and other NFC features on iPhone 15 handsets to stop working after charging the device using BMW’s in-car wireless chargers.
Yes, it’s a somewhat peculiar problem, and troublesome, too, especially considering that it could also affect the proper operation of the BMW’s digital car key. But the good news is that Apple’s release of iOS 17.1.1 on Tuesday finally resolves it.
Mobile Apple launched the iPhone 15 lineup recently, which includes the iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max. Of course, while the new series appears to be a hit with most, it’s not without its own set of issues too.
Despite the fact that the iPhone 15 has only been out for a few weeks, the rumor mill for the iPhone 16 has already begun, though it’s still quite early. But from what we’ve gathered so far, it looks like the iPhone 16 could be another worthy upgrade, especially if you haven’t picked up an iPhone 15 already.
