Why trust us? The best gaming laptop deals in Best Buy’s Black Friday sale By Albert Bassili Close Digital Trends Best Buy is having one of the biggest early Black Friday sales events, so if you want to pick up a new gaming laptop , it’s a great option, especially since it has such a wide selection from both AMD and Intel. It’s also worth checking out the My Best Buy Plus or Total membership; one or two of the deals below have extra discounts if you have it. For the most part though, we’ve done our best to shy away from any deals that require My Best Buy or anything of that sort.
Best Buy Gaming Laptop Black Friday Deals (AMD) Best Buy Gaming Laptop Black Friday Deals (Intel) Be sure to check out our lists of the best Black Friday laptop deals and Black Friday gaming laptop deals for a more generalized list of discounts.
Best Buy Gaming Laptop Black Friday Deals (AMD) AMD AMD processors in laptops are great because they tend to be a little bit more powerful and efficient compared to Intel. It’s not a huge difference, but you will see a bit of energy savings, as well as some monetary savings, since AMD CPUs tend to be cheaper, too. Luckily, Best Buy has a lot of great deals on AMD gaming laptops, so you can get even more savings, which is excellent.
HP Victus 15 with RTX 2050 — ASUS TUF Gaming A16 with RX7600S — Lenovo Legion Slim 5 with RTX 4060 — Lenovo Legion Slim 5 OLED with RTX 4060 — ASUS ROG Zephyrus G14 with RTX 4060 — Alienware m18 with RTX 4070 — Razer Blade 14 with RTX 4080 — Save on everything from laptops and tablets, to coffee makers and air purifiers, and a whole host of Apple tech like iPad, Apple Watch and even the latest M3 MacBooks, as well as smart home essentials like the Amazon Echo and smart bulbs.
Best Buy Gaming Laptop Black Friday Deals (Intel) Intel On the other hand, going with an Intel CPU, you’ll have a lot more choices at Best Buy, especially if you want some of the higher-end stuff. The efficiency isn’t that bad, and if you’re already going for a higher-end and power-hungry gaming laptop, it probably won’t make that much of a difference at the end of the day. Also, we should point out that these are arranged according to price rather than GPU, so if you see a higher-cost laptop with a lower-end GPU, it probably has a bigger screen, better CPU, or larger storage and RAM, so be sure to click through to double-check everything. These discounts include Razer Black Friday deals and MSI gaming laptop Black Friday deals.

To pile on to that, there are some great Black Friday deals you can take advantage of that will bring the price down even further. If you find that you need the full functionality of a laptop, check out our general Best Buy Black Friday laptop deals, or Black Friday laptop deals and Black Friday MacBook deals, for PC and MacOS respectively.
