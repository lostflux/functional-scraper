Of course, a critical component of every EV is the battery, which powers everything about an EV — from the electric motors to the infotainment system, to the air conditioning.
Lithium-ion batteries Nickel-metal hydride batteries But did you know there are actually different types of electric car batteries? As development on EVs continues, battery technology is shifting and evolving, helping push for cars with longer ranges.
So what are the different types of electric car batteries? There are two major types you need to know about, and each has its own benefits and drawbacks. Here’s a rundown.
Can electric car batteries be recycled? How do electric cars work? EV motors and batteries explained New battery design could mean EVs charge in only 10 minutes Lithium-ion batteries Christian de Looper / Digital Trends Lithium-ion batteries have become the dominant choice for powering EVs, offering a range of advantages over other battery technologies. One of the most significant benefits of lithium-ion batteries is their high energy density, which allows electric cars to travel longer distances on a single charge. Not only that, but lithium-ion batteries have a relatively low self-discharge rate, ensuring that the stored energy remains available for an extended period, even when the vehicle is not in use.
However, lithium-ion batteries also present some challenges for the EV industry. One of the primary concerns is the limited availability of raw materials, such as lithium and cobalt, which are crucial for battery production. The mining of these materials often has environmental and ethical implications.
 And, the production process of lithium-ion batteries generates a substantial carbon footprint, which can negate some of the environmental benefits of electric vehicles.
Performance over time is also somewhat of a concern. The performance of lithium-ion batteries tends to degrade over time, resulting in reduced range and charging capacity. This can lead to increased costs for consumers who need to replace the battery pack. Despite these issues, companies are continuing to research and develop lithium-ion batteries, and they’re set to get better and better over time.
Nickel-metal hydride batteries Stephen Edelstein/Digital Trends Nickel-metal hydride (NiMH) batteries have long been a popular choice for hybrid cars and have also been utilized in some EVs. One of the primary advantages of NiMH batteries is their robustness and durability. These batteries have a long cycle life, which means they can endure many charge and discharge cycles before their performance begins to decline. Not only that, but NiMH batteries can deliver high levels of power output, enabling quick acceleration and overall strong performance in hybrid cars and EVs.
There are some notable disadvantages associated with NiMH batteries when compared to other battery technologies. NiMH batteries have a lower energy density, meaning they store less energy per unit of weight or volume. This translates to reduced driving ranges, which can be a significant drawback for consumers concerned about range anxiety. And, NiMH batteries have a higher self-discharge rate than lithium-ion batteries, which means they can lose a more significant portion of their stored energy when not in use. This characteristic can be particularly problematic for EVs that are parked for extended periods.
Another downside of NiMH batteries is their sensitivity to extreme temperatures. High temperatures can negatively impact their performance and lifespan, while low temperatures can reduce their ability to deliver power. This limitation can present challenges in regions with varying climates. Although NiMH batteries do not rely on scarce materials like cobalt and lithium, their production still involves the use of nickel, which can raise environmental and ethical concerns surrounding mining practices.
Generally, it’s not expected that these batteries will be used more in EVs — but they could continue being used in hybrid cars that don’t necessarily require a higher energy density.
Editors' Recommendations These new NASA EVs will drive astronauts part way to the moon (sort of) Why do EVs charge slowly? Lithium battery limits explained Tesla’s new million-mile battery could finally make electric cars affordable Toyota is extending warranties on EV batteries because they’re lasting so long New research could help Tesla’s EV batteries last for a million miles Tech for Change The Food Fight Cars The Chevrolet Bolt EV was a major milestone for electric cars. It was the first electric car to achieve more than 200 miles of range with a starting price below $40,000 -- opening up a much wider swath of the market. But with rivals catching up, Chevy has upped the ante. The 2020 Chevrolet Bolt EV has an estimated range of 259 miles, up from the previous 238 miles. That puts the Bolt EV ahead of most competitors.
The 259-mile figure first appeared on the Environmental Protection Agency's fueleconomy.gov website, which lists the agency's electric range and fuel economy ratings, and was reported by Car and Driver before Chevy officially confirmed it. Power output is expected to remain the same, at 200 horsepower and 266 pound-feet of torque. Chevy previously said that will get the 2019 Bolt EV from 0 to 60 mph in 6.5 seconds.
Cars Solar panels can power your house, but what about your car? Hyundai is the latest automaker to experiment with solar charging systems for cars, unveiling a solar roof that helps recharge the Sonata Hybrid sedan's battery pack. While the latest version of the Sonata Hybrid will likely launch in the United States soon, Hyundai did not say whether the solar roof would be included.
Hyundai claims the solar roof can charge a car's battery pack to 30-60% capacity, given six hours of charging per day. Hybrids like the Sonata have smaller battery packs than all-electric cars, so a solar roof can make a bigger difference in charging. The solar roof can charge both while the car is stationary and while driving, according to Hyundai.
Cars Lucid Motors has become the latest automaker to announce that it will adopt the North American Charging Standard (NACS) – also known as "the Tesla plug" – for its electric vehicles.
The move follows in the footsteps of more than a dozen other automakers that have also adopted Tesla’s charging connector, among them General Motors, Ford, Toyota, BMW, Jaguar Land Rover, Volvo, and Honda.
