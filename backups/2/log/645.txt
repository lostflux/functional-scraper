A company statement says that a review ‚Äúconcluded that he was not consistently candid in his communications with the board, hindering its ability to exercise its responsibilities.‚Äù Mira Murati, previously OpenAI‚Äôs chief technology officer, was appointed interim CEO while OpenAI searches for a full-time replacement, the statement says.
Altman did not respond to a request for comment. OpenAI declined to comment.
The announcement said that Greg Brockman, who cofounded OpenAI with Altman alongside leading names in AI and technology including Elon Musk, would also step down from his role as chair of the company‚Äôs board.
No reason was given for Brockman‚Äôs change in position but he announced that he had resigned from the company several hours after the company's statement. He shared an email sent to OpenAI staff on X.
 ‚ÄúI‚Äôm super proud of what we‚Äôve all built since starting in my apartment 8 years ago," the email said. "We‚Äôve been through tough and great times together, accomplishing so much despite all the reasons it should have been impossible. But based on today‚Äôs news, I quit.‚Äù An investor in OpenAI who spoke anonymously because they did not have full details of the board's concerns said its statement suggested the gravity of Altman's alleged lack of candor was significant and it's possible the changeover could lead to employees heading elsewhere. OpenAI and AI rivals such as Google and Meta have intensified their competition for AI talent since ChatGPT's debut last year.
The surprising capabilities of ChatGPT, such as solving complex puzzles and handling questions that appear to require human-like reasoning, stunned AI researchers, amazed the public, and triggered an arms race among big tech companies to build more powerful AI. The bot‚Äôs success turned Altman into a tech celebrity, consulted by world leaders on the future path of AI technology.
Altman appeared yesterday at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in San Francisco, telling hundreds of business and government leaders that AI systems could solve humanity's most-pressing problems if their development were pursued responsibly.
‚ÄúWe're on a path to self-destruction as a species right now,‚Äù he said, sitting alongside executives from Meta and Google. ‚ÄúWe need new technology if we want to flourish for tens, hundreds of thousands, and millions of years more.‚Äù Gear The Best Home Depot Black Friday Deals Matt Jancer Gear The Best Early Black Friday Deals We've Found Nena Farrell Business Who Is Mira Murati, OpenAI‚Äôs New Interim CEO? Steven Levy Business Elon Musk May Have Just Signed X‚Äôs Death Warrant Vittoria Elliott Altman acknowledged that success wasn‚Äôt certain, but he expressed confidence that AI would ultimately be beneficial, describing the technology as his life's work, from childhood. ‚ÄúThis will be the most transformative and beneficial technology humanity has yet invented,‚Äù he said.
OpenAI was founded in 2015 as a nonprofit focused on safely developing AI more intelligent than humans. It was funded by Musk and others, including Peter Thiel and LinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman.
OpenAI became a for-profit company in 2019, as the cost of building and training advanced AI became challenging. It struck a partnership with Microsoft in 2019 that saw the software giant invest a billion dollars and provide cloud computing power for training OpenAI‚Äôs algorithms. This year Microsoft agreed to invest a further $10 billion into OpenAI.
OpenAI developed a number of cutting-edge AI projects in the years after its creation, but the introduction of ChatGPT in November 2022 quickly turned the company into one of the most important businesses on earth.
Microsoft was given a brief heads up about OpenAI's announcement of management changes today, according to a person familiar with the matter speaking on the condition of anonymity. They declined to say what Microsoft was told about the OpenAI board's justifications.
Microsoft later posted a statement from CEO Satya Nadella saying that the company is committed to its partnership with OpenAI and to Murati and her team. ‚ÄúTogether, we will continue to deliver the meaningful benefits of this technology to the world,‚Äù Nadella's statement says.
