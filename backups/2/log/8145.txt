White Close Jacob Roach / Digital Trends AMD‚Äôs aging AM4 platform has been around since 2016, and it‚Äôs a socket that AMD has promised to support for ‚Äúfor many years.‚Äù We thought we‚Äôd waved goodbye to AM4 for good, but a new leak says that AMD has two new 3D V-Cache chips in the works, namely the Ryzen 7 5700X3D and the Ryzen 5 5500X3D. If the rumor is to be believed, AMD may not be done with AM4 yet, which is great news for those hoping not to have to upgrade their entire PC just to get the latest performance.
As per the user @g01d3nm4ng0 on Twitter , the new chips will serve up the same massive L3 cache we‚Äôve come to expect from AMD‚Äôs X3D chips, making them solid options for gamers on a tighter budget. No one expected that AMD would keep releasing new versions of last-gen chips well over a year since the launch of the Ryzen 7000, and yet, it seems that they‚Äôre in the works.
New AM4 Ryzen 7 5700X3D and Ryzen 5 5500X3D are coming ? üßêüßêüßê 5700X3D: 8C/16T, 4.1GHz/3.0GHz, 96MB L3 cache, 5500X3D: 6C/12T, 4.0GHz/3.0GHz, 96MB L3 cache.
&mdash; chi11eddog (@g01d3nm4ng0) November 14, 2023 Right now, we don‚Äôt know much about these new processors, although the leaker shed some light on the possible specs. The Ryzen 7 5700X3D is said to come with eight cores and 16 threads, a maximum clock speed of 4.1GHz and a 3.0GHz base speed, and 96MB of L3 cache. The Ryzen 5 5500X3D sports the same cache size, but has only six cores and 12 threads, as well as a maximum frequency of 4GHz.
The Ryzen 7 5700X3D is close to the 5800X3D in specs, and the latter is still one of the fastest gaming CPUs.
 The core counts are the same, and the clock speeds are relatively comparable, as the 5800X3D maxes out at 4.5GHz. The 5500X3D falls short due to only sporting six cores, but if it does get released, it should still be a speedy CPU with that massive cache and high boost clock.
AMD next-gen CPUs might deliver the biggest upgrade in years It‚Äôs official ‚Äî AMD‚Äôs best gaming CPU is coming to laptops These two CPUs are the only ones you should care about in 2023 This wouldn‚Äôt be the first time that AMD is revisiting an older platform. It has recently released the Microcenter-exclusive Ryzen 5 5600X3D , allowing for a cheaper upgrade path, but the fact that it‚Äôs a limited edition made it hard to get for many PC builders.
Choosing to build a PC based on AM4 right now is a little controversial, seeing as the platform was supposed to be dead ‚Äî but there are perks, too. It‚Äôs a lot cheaper thanks to more affordable motherboards and DDR4 RAM , whereas AMD‚Äôs latest AM5 socket requires DDR5 RAM and motherboards that start at $100 (and, realistically, cost around $200 if you want a decent model).
For gamers who don‚Äôt want to overspend, the 5800X3D and its less efficient siblings are a great way to get a solid CPU that won‚Äôt need upgrades for a few years. Seeing as AMD, unlike Intel and Nvidia, often tries to appeal to the mainstream part of the market, it makes sense that it would still want to use up those remaining last-gen chips and give gamers more upgrade options if they‚Äôre still on the AM4 platform.
For now, we‚Äôre left with more questions than answers. Will the Ryzen 7 5700X3D and Ryzen 5 5500X3D really be released, and if so, when? How much will they cost, and will they be as hard to get as the 5600X3D? If this is true, we‚Äôll likely hear more about it within the next few months, so stay tuned.
Editors' Recommendations AMD might admit defeat, but it‚Äôs for the best The gamers have spoken: AMD obliterates Intel in CPU sales AMD might be about to launch the most powerful laptop of 2023 AMD‚Äôs latest V-Cache chip proves to be cheap, fast, and perfect for gaming AMD‚Äôs upcoming Ryzen 5 5600X3D could completely dethrone Intel in budget builds News Tech News Computing Zen 4 still feels quite new, but AMD is already preparing to launch its Zen 5 architecture in 2024, with AMD Ryzen 8000 processors now on the horizon.
New leaks shed some light on the upcoming chips, and while a lot is still uncertain, one thing is clear -- AMD is sticking to a somewhat controversial design choice that sets it apart from Intel: keeping the same core counts.
Computing If you already have one of AMD's best processors for gaming, such as the Ryzen 9 7950X3D or the Ryzen 7 7800X3D, both your CPU and your motherboard might be in trouble.
Several reports of the processor burning up have recently surfaced. While AMD hasn't made any statements, it's possible that a new BIOS update might be enough to keep your gear safe.
Computing It's no secret that AMD's 3D V-Cache CPUs top the list of the best gaming processors, but the new Ryzen 7 7800X3D puts AMD shoppers in a precarious position. As you can read in our Ryzen 7 7800X3D review, it tops the charts in gaming performance even if it takes a backseat in productivity power. Is that gap enough to justify spending more on the Ryzen 9 7950X3D? Even with around $300 separating the Ryzen 7 7800X3D and Ryzen 9 7950X3D, the performance gap between them is much closer than their prices would suggest. I threw them both on my test bench to see if spending up is worth it, and there's a clear answer -- the Ryzen 7 7800X3D is the CPU to buy.
