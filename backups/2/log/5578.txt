There was never an explanation for that change in design, but it is now looking as though the originally promised 3D emoji could still be in the works.
Though Microsoft itself hasn’t recently said anything about 3D emoji on its official channels, one of its employees sent indications about it. In a response to a tweet from a Windows 11 user lamenting the lack of 3D emoji, Nando Costa, who is the visual artist and design leader at Microsoft Design, said: “Thank you and agreed! We’re working on that.” Image used with permission by copyright holder This goes back to what happened in November 2021. At that time, Microsoft admitted to Windows Central that it lacked clarity about where 3D emojis would show up. The company indicated that 3D emoji will only show up in apps that support them, such as Microsoft Teams or Skype. It’s more than likely that Costa’s tweet is referring to this, as rolling out 3D emoji to all of Windows and all of its platforms might be quite the task for the company, according to The Verge.
Either way, it’s the first time in a while that a Microsoft employee has spoken about the topic. Another Microsoft employee, Brandon LeBlanc, who is a product manager on the Windows Insider Program, also commented on this issue , pointing to the Microsoft Design Blog for more details.
A major Windows update just launched. Here’s what’s new I love Macs. But here are 5 reasons I keep coming back to Windows The best Windows 11 themes Microsoft put a lot of thought into its emoji redesign, even if the emoji are just 2D. In a LinkedIn post , Costa talks about the long journey of upgrading Windows’ emoji. Costa says the emoji are more personal and familiar. He also revealed that Microsoft used tools like Adobe Illustrator and Font Lab in the design process There still might not be a solid date for when you can expect 3D emoji in Windows 11, but Costa did indicate on LinkedIn that the team will “continue creating new designs every year.” We’ll let you be the judge on what that means, but for now, 2D emoji and Clippy might have to do.
Editors' Recommendations Windows 11 might finally reverse course on preinstalled applications Surprise: Windows 11 is doing much better than we thought This simple keyboard shortcut could save you when installing Windows 11 Intel may have accidentally leaked the release date for Windows 12 Windows 11 adoption is slowing, and we finally know why News Microsoft Microsoft Windows Tech News Windows 11 Computing A quick PSA: If you own one of AMD's best graphics cards and you like to tweak the settings, now is not a good time to download the latest Windows Update. According to users on the AMD forums, the KB5030310 update really doesn't agree with AMD's Adrenalin Control Panel. While it's not the end of the world, this isn't the first Windows update in the last few months that has caused problems.
It appears that every time people restart their PCs, their Adrenalin settings are all reset back to default. This means that any changes made to things like AMD's Anti-Lag or Hyper RX will disappear upon every boot. Fortunately, the graphics driver itself is unaffected.
Computing Windows 12 is already upon us. Microsoft hasn't released the new operating system yet, or even formally announced it, but Microsoft's September 2023 event made it clear that recent updates to Windows 11 are laying the foundation for the next iteration of the OS.
A significant portion of the presentation focused on the upcoming AI assistant that is set to "revolutionize" the way you use Windows. A new update is now available for Windows 11 that adds Copilot to the OS. Copilot is said to be an everyday AI companion that provides assistance by uniquely integrating information from the internet, your work-related data, and your current PC tasks. It offers a range of AI features to numerous default apps by collecting data from your calendar, email, documents, and more to assist in quick text and email composition.
Computing I don't blame you if you're fed up with all of the AI talk. It started with ChatGPT, it moved to Bing Chat, and now you can't open up Apple News without a deluge of AI news. It's overwhelming. And now, Microsoft wants you to use AI as an assistant throughout all of Windows 11. No thanks.
Call me a cynic, but I pushed back. Bing Chat following me around Windows 11 didn't sound like a good time, but I swallowed my pride, decided to do my job as a tech journalist, and kindly asked what it could do at Microsoft's September 2023 event. And Windows Copilot blew me away.
