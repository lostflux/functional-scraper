Why trust us? Shopping at Apple this holiday season? You should know this By Trevor Mogg Close If you splash out on an Apple product during the upcoming holiday season — whether it’s an iPhone, iPad, Mac, smartwatch, earbuds, or some other item — then it’s important to know the terms and conditions in the event that you want to return it.
For most of the year, Apple offers a refund if you return an unwanted item within two weeks of buying it. But during the hectic holiday season when we might be away or busy with friends and family, it usually extends the period to make the returns process more convenient.
It means that any Apple gear bought between November 3, 2023, and December 25, 2023, can be returned up until January 8, 2024.
There are some caveats, though. For example, iPhone purchases that are carrier-financed with T-Mobile are not eligible and are subject to Apple’s standard return policy of 14 days.
Also, only items that have been bought directly from Apple — whether online or at one of its official retail stores — can be returned to Apple. If you bought an Apple product via another retailer, you’ll need to check its own returns and refunds policy.
Apple also points out that some items are not eligible for return, such as software that’s been installed on a computer, electronic software downloads, and Apple Gift Cards.
For full details, check out the Refunds & Returns page on Apple’s website.
And if you do purchase an Apple product and decide to keep it, the company usually offers extended trials of various Apple services, such as three free months of its streaming service, Apple TV+.
iPhone customers, for example, will see a prompt to sign up for any free trials via the handset’s Settings page on their new device once they’ve signed in to their Apple account.
Editors' Recommendations It looks like the iPhone 16 will get a big design upgrade All the best macOS Sonoma tips and tricks you need to know This iPhone 15 and iPhone 14 camera test is closer than I expected 4 AI features I want in my next iPhone I figured out how to protect my iPhone without an ugly case Mobile News Apple Apple iPhone Tech News Wearables Mobile iPhone 14 Plus (left) and iPhone 15 Plus Andy Boxall / Digital Trends If you’re reading this article, chances are high that you keep pretty up-to-date with modern technology, including smartphones like Apple’s iPhone. You may upgrade your phone every few years, or — if you’re like me — you might even upgrade every year.
Mobile The iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max have an all-new titanium body, which is the standout feature from a design perspective. However, another hardware-related feature that's even more noteworthy for these models — and future iPhones over time — is the new Action button.
The Action button replaces the ring/silent switch on the left side of the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max. You can assign one shortcut to the button through the Settings app, such as activating and using the Camera app or turning on the phone's flashlight. To assign the button, go into the Settings app on your supported iPhone. From there, choose the Action Button, then toggle to your selection. It's that simple.
Computing Apple has confirmed it has no plans to release a 27-inch iMac in the immediate future. The news comes on the same day that reviews for Apple's 24-inch iMac M3 and MacBook Pro M3 went live, with the company urging pro users who had been waiting for a 27-inch iMac update to go with a Mac Studio or Mac Pro instead.
An Apple representative confirmed that a 27-inch iMac with Apple silicon won't be arriving soon to The Verge. Apple last updated the 27-inch iMac in 2020, just a few months before Apple silicon was released to the world. It never saw Apple Silicon, instead being stuck on older Intel chips. Apple discontinued the product in 2021, eventually delisting it the next year.
