DTS Play-Fi , the wireless multiroom audio platform that can be used to set up a fully wireless home theater sound system, has expanded from its previous 5.1-channel limitation to 12 channels, which can support surround sound formats like Dolby Atmos , DTS:X, or IMAX Enhanced in up to a 7.2.4-channel configuration.
The news comes two days after the announcement of Dolby Labs’ Dolby Atmos FlexConnect technology that will provide a similar level of wireless speaker flexibility for owners of compatible TVs.
Select European 2023 Philips TVs will be the first devices to launch the latest DTS Play-Fi Home Theater enhancements — and they are expected to debut later in 2023. There are currently no DTS Play-Fi-equipped TVs being sold in the U.S. or Canada, however the same 12-channel capability will also be added to DTS Play-Fi-compatible soundbars like the powerful Philips Fidelio FB1 , according to Dannie Lau, DTS Play-Fi’s general manager.
Sonos’ new Era 100 and Era 300 wireless speakers go all-in on spatial audio and Bluetooth What is MPEG-H? The burgeoning 3D audio standard explained Sonos adds Dolby Atmos Music and hi-res audio support for Amazon Music TVs that are DTS Play-Fi-equipped can communicate with compatible wireless speakers over standard Wi-Fi, using the TV’s own Wi-Fi connection. In theory, this lets you eliminate the HDMI cable connection from your TV to your soundbar, or even eliminate the soundbar entirely — like Dolby Atmos FlexConnect, DTS Play-Fi can include your TV’s built-in speakers as part of your home theater layout.
The DTS Play-Fi platform is smart TV software-agnostic, which means almost any TV maker could choose to implement it. It works with any sound source that is processed by the TV, including streaming devices, Blu-ray players, game consoles, and the TV’s own built-in streaming apps. Play-Fi speakers are also Chromecast and Apple AirPlay compatible for even greater streaming flexibility.
With today’s announcement, there are now three wireless technologies that can be used to create a multichannel, immersive audio home theater system directly from a TV, without the need for a soundbar or AV receiver : DTS Play-Fi, Dolby Atmos FlexConnect, and WiSA.
 However, of these, only DTS Play-Fi can be used as a multiroom wireless system to extend your TV’s sound into other rooms, or play different audio sources everywhere in your home.

It's a big selection and there's a soundbar for every room and every budget, from a simple 2-channel volume booster to a fully immersive 5.1.2 Dolby Atmos sofa-shaker.
We don't yet have the full specs for each model, but they're all available today -- or within the coming days -- at major retailers and online.
Audio / Video Today, Sonos took the wraps off the $799 Sonos Arc, the company's first Dolby Atmos-capable wireless soundbar that replaces both the aging Playbar as well as the much more recent Sonos Playbase in the company's home theater lineup.
Sonos also unveiled updated versions of the Sonos Sub, now in its third generation, and the Play:5, which has been re-named Sonos Five. Both the Sub and Five get refreshed internal processors and wireless modules, but the drivers and amps (and prices, $699 and $499 respectively) remain untouched. The Sonos Five has been given a small exterior cosmetic change: The grille is now color-matched to the body, bringing the speaker in line with the design of the Sonos One, One SL, and Sonos Move.
Audio / Video Vizio has always enjoyed a reputation for producing soundbars that are fantastic values, delivering far better sound than their affordable prices would suggest. And while that's still true, at CES 2020, Vizio is upping its soundbar game considerably.
