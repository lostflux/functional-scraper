HBO's The Last of Us recently concluded its terrific first season on Sunday night. The series has already been renewed for a second season, which will be developed from the video game The Last of Us Part II. However, showrunners Craig Mazin (Chernobyl) and Neil Druckmann (Uncharted) revealed the second season would not cover the entirety of Part II and they need a third and potentially fourth season to complete the story.
Entertainment Now that we've seen the entire first season, it's safe to say that The Last of Us is going to be remembered as one of the great shows in recent memory. While the show's story has been deeply compelling from the jump, what got most people invested in it was the wealth of great characters that exist in this universe.
In addition to the memorable season 1 The Last of Us cameos, the show had a cast of characters that were among TV's best. As difficult as it was to narrow it down to just 10, these are the characters from the show's first season that have stuck with us the most.
Entertainment The first season of HBO's hit show The Last of Us has come to an end. After such a shocking and heart-wrenching conclusion, fans have been left anxious to see what will become of Joel and Ellie in season 2. Since the show's source material continues far beyond where the first season concludes, there is still so much to look forward to, and so many possibilities for the second.
Note: This article features spoilers for the second season of The Last of Us.
Plot rumors Season 1 of the show adapted events from both the first game and the Left Behind DLC, so it's likely that season 2 will follow the story from The Last of Us Part II. Taking place four years after the original, this sequel follows Joel and Ellie after the latter learns that Joel stopped the Fireflies from killing her and making a cure for the Cordyceps pandemic. Here's everything that audiences could see in terms of the story.
