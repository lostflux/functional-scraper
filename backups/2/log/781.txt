Why trust us? The best Mac games for 2023 By Jacob Roach and Jesse Lennox Close Macs have always been hit or miss when it comes to gaming. Until just a few years ago, it was always a gamble to know if a game would come to this operating system, and most of the time, that gamble didn’t pay off. However, at WWDC 2022, Apple committed to starting “a new day” for Mac gaming focused on two new features to make the platform better. These features are MetalFX, an upscaling program, and the Fast Resource Loading API, which will decrease game loading times.
With these new advancements, more and more games will be coming to Mac, bringing with them a new group of gamers looking for something to play. It doesn’t matter what kind of Mac gamer you are — there’s something for you. That includes AAA blockbusters like Shadow of the Tomb Raider , methodical shooters like Deus Ex: Mankind Divided , and indie darlings like Stardew Valley.
Apple fans may not have access to every Windows game and Steam game, but you’ll still find many of the best PC games below.

Gaming Gamers who need to replace their aging screens should take advantage of this year's Black Friday deals for a new gaming monitor, as there are discounts offered for displays made by some of the most trusted brands like Samsung, HP, Dell, and Lenovo. Among the most important things to consider for your purchase are size, resolution, and refresh rate -- and of course, if the price fits your budget. There's no shortage of options that you can find online from the different retailers, but you help you make a decision quickly, we've gathered our top picks below. We've organized these monitors by refresh rate. If you prioritize resolution, consider checking out the best 4K monitor Black Friday deals or 5K monitor Black Friday deals.
Best 165Hz gaming monitor Black Friday deals A monitor's refresh rate determines how often the images on the screen are updated -- the higher the refresh rate, the smoother your gameplay will be.

Size and resolution are other factors to consider though, so you should be going for the monitor that your budget allows.
