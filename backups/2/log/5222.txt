Price, content, and more Free Movies on YouTube Play YouTube in the Background What is YouTube Music? Home Computing Features I couldn’t live without this simple desktop YouTube feature By Jon Martindale Close Big YouTube fan? I know I am. I have ASMR content rolling all day while I’m writing away, so yes, I’m one of those people who pays for YouTube Premium.
 But one feature I’ve been using a ton recently doesn’t require a premium membership — the excellent picture in picture mode.
How to use YouTube picture in picture What can you do with YouTube PiP? Do you need YouTube Premium to use PiP? I’m a big synthwave nerd too. That’s not relevant, I just love The Midnight.
Image used with permission by copyright holder How to use YouTube picture in picture If you typically watch YouTube on your phone, you’ve probably come across this feature already. You just swipe away from the app to ‘exit’ it while you’re watching a video, and it will appear as a small window in the corner of your phone.
But did you know you can use it for desktop and laptop PCs, too? There’s no swiping to do there, but if you double right-click, you’ll find the option available in a drop-down menu. Select it, and the video will pop up in the corner, floating over the rest of your content. That way the video remains visible no matter what else you do on your computer. It doesn’t have to be in a browser, either.
I use Steam every day, and I couldn’t live without these 6 hidden features Celebrate our 1,000,000 YouTube subscriber milestone with us and win! YouTube brings pinch to zoom and video navigation changes to everyone Even Windows Key + D doesn’t defeat it. Impressive, right? What can you do with YouTube PiP? If you often work with YouTube on in the background, PiP has an obvious benefit. Sure, you could just pull the tab out into a separate window and resize it, but if you work on a large monitor, PiP is extremely convenient. But that’s not the only situation it comes in handy for.
If you’re trying to do some troubleshooting on your computer, having an instructional video sitting on top of everything else is super useful. No minimizing and re-opening it every time you want to change the active window.
You can move the PiP window around too. It doesn’t have to just stay where it pops out. Stick it in the corner. Stick it in the middle of your screen. Have it take up the center of your top bar like some kind of Mac notch.
When you’re on mobile, look out for the headphone icon in PiP mode. If you tap that, you’ll just listen to the audio rather than loading the video. That can save bandwidth if you’re in an area with a weaker signal.
It’s great for having your ASMR shoe-fitting video running while you write about YouTube PiP.
Image used with permission by copyright holder Do you need YouTube Premium to use PiP? No. Not exactly. At least, according to Google. YouTube’s Picture in Picture feature works on any browser and any device, for anyone, regardless of whether they have YouTube Premium or not.
However, there is certain content that reportedly won’t work with PiP without a subscription. Google suggests that includes certain “music videos,” though I’ve not been able to find one that won’t allow PiP without a subscription. So for the vast majority of content, you’re fine without it.
Editors' Recommendations Why I couldn’t live without an ultrawide gaming monitor YouTube tries new way of tackling ad blockers What is Ambient Mode on YouTube? YouTube to overhaul channel names with @ handles for all Searches for health topics on YouTube now highlights personal stories Features YouTube Computing YouTube's dislike button does nothing for the algorithm, a new Mozilla study has found. We continue to see content we don't want no matter how much we mash that thumbs down. The same goes for "Not Interested" and "Don't recommend this channel" options.
The report, titled Does This Button Work? Investigating YouTube's Ineffective User Controls, comes after a months-long study of YouTube behavior by the Mozilla Foundation. They enlisted the help of 20,000 volunteer web users through an extension on Mozilla's Firefox browser, the RegretsReporter.
Social Media YouTube Shorts, the video-sharing website's answer to TikTok videos, is getting a new comment reply feature and with it, looks more like its wildly popular competitor.
On Thursday, the new feature was announced via an update to a YouTube Help thread titled "New Features and Updates for Shorts Viewers & Creators." The announcement was posted by a TeamYouTube community manager.
Social Media Podcasts certainly aren't new to YouTube, but the popular video-sharing site appears to be making it easier to find them on its sprawling platform.
9to5Google has reported that YouTube has created a dedicated Explore page for podcasts and that it is currently live on the site for some users. The new Podcasts page is apparently still rolling out and has been since at least late July. While not everyone is able to view the new podcast Explore page right now, some of us at Digital Trends have been able to access it.
