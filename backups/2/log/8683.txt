 “How do you create experiences that work well for women and men? It starts with understanding their different preferences and motivations, and the choices they make.” The Microsoft-hosted conference included panels from academics and people from other companies. The consensus: tech needs to understand women if it wants to make the best possible design choices.
“Constantly retrofitting for women isn’t the best way forward,” said Londa Schiebinger, Professor of History of Science at Stanford. “When you do integrate sex and gender into research you get something better.” All-male design teams might miss subtle differences between the way men and women experience technology, and as such not make the best product possible. This could cost companies money.
“At Design People, we think that women’s needs are different from men’s, and we can use this difference to make a better user experience,” said Klaus Shcroder for Scandivian design firm Design People. He added that this can help companies pull ahead of the competition.
It&#39;s about applying the female lens to people&#39;s passions and projects. Not just making something pink or sparkly.
#hackforher &mdash; Jennifer C Moynihan (@jcmoynihan) January 13, 2016 Of course, if part of finding that understanding is hiring women in technology roles, Microsoft itself has a long way to go: only 16.9 percent of their tech workforce are women, according to their own diversity reports.
 That’s a problem if Microsoft takes the thesis of its own conferences seriously.
“Ignorance is not bliss,” said Margarette Burnette. “You have to pay attention to gender if you’re going to be able to be inclusive.” News Tech News Women With Byte Computing Printers are complicated machines featuring a mix of plastics, metals, electronics, and components, some of which are potentially flagged as hazardous waste. In 2023, it's more important than ever to be kind to the planet, and there are several environmentally safe ways to dispose of a printer.
Even the best printers in the world can reach the end of their life after several years if ink or toner is no longer available. A well-loved printer can suffer from accumulated wear and tear or damage from a catastrophic power surge that's too expensive to repair.
Computing It's Black Friday, which means it is time to give expensive tech products and fun, but expensive, toys a second look. The right Black Friday deals are there to take these categories of products down in price. Where these categories of expensive tech and cool toys collide is the Meta Quest 2, a VR headset, and sure enough, it has a good sale going on over at Amazon right now. Normally $300, its price has dropped by $51 down to just $249, one of the best VR headset Black Friday deals we've seen. The really good news? This deal is here now, so you don't have to wait to buy it like you will with the rest of your post Thanksgiving shopping. In fact, if you tap the button below and buy now, and with a little shipping luck, you might have it by Thanksgiving to play with your family.
Why you should buy the Meta Quest 2 The Meta Quest 2, which dominated Steam last year, is a VR headset that gives a full 360 field of view, allows you to experience 3D positional audio, and has over 500 compatible titles between gaming, fitness, and other experiences. If you're a Twitch viewer, you may recognize it from streamers playing Meta Quest 2 games like Beat Saber or the somewhat ironically humorous Among Us VR. It refreshes at 120Hz and gives each eye a view of 1832 x 1920p.
Computing The G-series of gaming laptops from Dell represent a balance between performance and affordability. While it is positioned below the Alienware gaming laptop lineup, it manages to incorporate some of the standout features from its more expensive counterpart. It takes inspiration from its pricier cousin in terms of design and build quality, and also offers commendable thermal and graphics performance.
The company officially unveiled the 2023 G-series back in January at CES, and if you have decided to purchase a new Dell gaming laptop, then we recommend going for the latest G16 7630.
