No other title captures the deep, peaty feel of running and jumping through an imaginary world of turtle infested forests and cloud kingdoms like this game. It’s a craftsman’s exploration of momentum, but it isn’t an artist’s. Something essential is lost in New Super Mario Bros. 2 , and no amount of raccoon tails or golden coins can replace it.
All the elements are here. Bowser’s ragamuffin kids kidnap Princess “Peach” Toadstool just like in Super Mario Bros. 3 (and New Super Mario Bros. Wii and other games) and it’s up to Mario and Luigi to traipse across 8 worlds to find her. As Mario topples those kids in their castle fortresses, the vanquished kids hand off the princess to the nearest sibling using the same route they always use: Familiar green Mushroom Kingdom hills give way to desert in World 2, beach and forest in World 3, then ice, then sky, then the volcanoes Bowser always goes home to. Why doesn’t Mario just get in his car and drive to the fire world to ask Bowser if he can cut out the middlemen and possibly play a pick up game of tennis ? Templates don’t damn a project.
NSMB Wii borrowed the very same structure from New Super Mario Bros.
That game’s levels though featured expansive designs built to accommodate up to four players, and as a result felt totally unique.
NSMB Wii ’s stages were expansive, startling, and challenging in ways that forced you to rethink how Mario moved.
New Super Mario Bros. 2 meanwhile only offers variations, not new ideas. Old Mario games have a giant ghost named Big Boo? Well what about an even bigger Boo! That’s the theme of one ghost house level early in the game, and it’s fun, just rote. Warp Zones are the one exception. You can jump forward in the game with canons unlocked by finding secret level exits, but they don’t just fire you into new worlds. Instead, they fire you into shadow levels where you can’t stop running, just timing perfect jumps on enemies over precise traps.
Image used with permission by copyright holder New Super Mario Bros. 2 ’s raison d’être, at least according to the marketing, is the overflow of golden coins in each level but even this is just a revisiting of an old idea. Coins in the original SMB were a reward earning you extra lives, but their primary purpose was tutorial. They were positioned in ways that showed you how to run and jump through a level properly. By the end, they were arranged in trickier ways to demonstrate expert maneuvers. Stages in NSMB 2 do the same and dole out coins in different ways; blocks with multiple coins can turn into golden helmets spouting coins as Mario moves; hopping into a tiny crevasse between two pipes will cause a row of coins to magically appear above Mario. There’s no tangible reward for collecting coins though. Showing off to friends through Coin Rush, an extra mode with three difficulty levels slowly unlocked as you move through the campaign, is an entertaining diversion but insubstantial. The coins aren’t game changers—There’s just a lot of them around.
Best armor and weapons in Super Mario RPG and where to find them All Melody Bay song solutions in Super Mario RPG Super Mario RPG is halfway between a remaster and remake Super Mario Bros.
was, as a series, synonymous with surprise. One of video games’ greatest pleasures over the past 27 years was firing up the latest Mario adventure and finding out what was going to happen. Prediction was impossible. After Super Mario Bros.
had you run from left to right hopping on turtles, Super Mario Bros. 2 had you hitting punk-rocker mice in the face with vegetables.
Super Mario Bros. 3 had giants, sprawling maps, and you could fly.
Super Mario World had vicious terrapin football players and dead-end forests and dinosaur pals.
Yoshi’s Island was a storybook come to life.
That tradition has continued into today.
New Super Mario Bros.
was a scaled back exploration of the 1985 original’s fundamentals, but it tweaked those fundamentals with wall-jumping and new mushrooms that made you massive or miniscule, forcing you play stages multiple times in different ways.
NSMB Wii stretched out levels to accommodate more players, and as a result made a solo Mario that played unlike any previous entries.
There are no surprises in NSMB 2.
 There are tricks and fun and some solid, laudable work, but no surprises.
Conclusion There’s a good reason that NSMB 2 just feels like craftsmen’s work. Since the series is Nintendo’s golden goose, it opened “ Mario Cram School ,” bringing in developers from Nintendo’s internal studios other than the Mario teams to teach them how to make levels in the series and thus crank out new games quicker. First time Mario director Yusuke Amano and his team of rookies learned their lessons well, but you can’t teach inspiration, and even Mario’s weirdest adventures like Super Mario Sunshine are overflowing with that.
The Model T Ford was a good car in much the same way that New Super Mario Bros. 2 is a good game. It’s just a game without a soul.
Score: 6.5 out of 10 (This game was reviewed on the Nintendo 3DS on a copy provided by Nintendo) Editors' Recommendations The best Mario games of all time, ranked Super Mario RPG: Sunken Ship password solution Nintendo introduces a new Super Smash Bros. Switch OLED for Black Friday The best video games of October 2023: Mario, Spider-Man 2, and more Our 10 favorite Wonder Effects in Super Mario Bros. Wonder Nintendo Nintendo Switch Gaming While I’m only partway through Super Mario Bros. Wonder, I’m already utterly in love with the game.
As our glowing review outlined, it’s a highly polished 2D platformer that’s approachable for anyone to play and elicits a joyous and vibrant sense of wonder. But for me, what makes Super Mario Bros. Wonder special aren't so much the wild Wonder effects or elephant transformations. It's the subtle touches. These elements might not be immediately noticeable or relevant to most, but they all work together to create an experience that’s a step above most other platformers.
Changes enhance enjoyment Super Mario Bros. Wonder isn’t afraid to show that it’s different from previous Mario games through small moments and changes. One instance that illustrates this early on is in one of the first Bowser Jr. fights. It starts like all his New Super Mario Bros. boss fights do, with him getting in his shell and spinning toward Mario. At first, I was disappointed that Nintendo was just doing the same thing again, but after the first hit, that changed. Bowser Jr. activates a Wonder effect and changes in size for the following two stages of his fight. It's a moment of surprise that subverts my expectations, which are based on decades of Mario games. This is a small moment and reference that many Super Mario Bros. Wonder players probably won’t even internalize. Still, it is a smart way to show how the platformer differs from what came before.
Gaming Super Mario Bros. Wonder is taking the series back to its 2D roots with a new and exciting art style and a ton of new mechanics. Alongside new power-ups and badges, this title has perhaps the largest amount of collectibles and hidden secrets of any game in the series. Between all the Wonder Seeds, Wonder Flowers, Flower Coins, and more, there's no shortage of things to do as you run, jump, and flip your way through all the various worlds. Among all the playable characters to choose from, one non-playable character makes his triumphant return. Captain Toad has managed to make his way to the Flower Kingdom, but this intrepid explorer is not so easy to find. Each time you interact with him, he will reward you with some Flower Coins and a hint at an upcoming world, so let's hunt down all his locations in Super Mario Wonder.
All Captain Toad locations Captain Toad appears in five unique spots on the Super Mario Bros. Wonder world map. Talking to him at each spot will give you a little bit more of his story, plus the aforementioned rewards.

You can even engage in races against your pals by hitting the Race Block at the beginning of many stages. Here's how to get started playing Super Mario Bros. Wonder online with friends.
