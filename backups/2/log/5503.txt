Among the data trove was a backup of two former employees’ workstations, which contained keys, passwords, secrets, and more than 30,000 private Teams messages.
Full control Potential disaster According to cloud security firm Wiz , the leak was published on Microsoft’s artificial intelligence (AI) GitHub repository and was accidentally included in a tranche of open-source training data. That means visitors were encouraged to download it, meaning it could have fallen into the wrong hands again and again.
Stock Depot / Getty Images Data breaches can come from all kinds of sources, but it will be particularly embarrassing for Microsoft that this one originated with its own AI researchers. The Wiz report states that Microsoft uploaded the data using Shared Access Signature (SAS) tokens, an Azure feature, that lets users share data through Azure Storage accounts.
Visitors to the repository were told to download the training data from a provided URL. However, the web address granted access to much more than just the planned training data, and allowed users to browse files and folders that were not intended to be publicly accessible.
Bing Chat’s ads are sending users to dangerous malware sites Microsoft’s Copilot AI will have an ‘energy,’ apparently Microsoft says bizarre travel article was not created by ‘unsupervised AI’ Full control Sora Shimazaki / Pexels It gets worse. The access token that allowed all this was misconfigured to provide full control permissions, Wiz reported, rather than more restrictive read-only permissions. In practice, that meant that anyone who visited the URL could delete and overwrite the files they found, not merely view them.
Wiz explains that this could have had dire consequences. As the repository was full of AI training data , the intention was for users to download it and feed it into a script, thereby improving their own AI models.
Yet because it was open to manipulation thanks to its wrongly configured permissions, “an attacker could have injected malicious code into all the AI models in this storage account, and every user who trusts Microsoft’s GitHub repository would’ve been infected by it,” Wiz explains.
Potential disaster Digital Trends The report also noted that the creation of SAS tokens – which grant access to Azure Storage folders such as this one – does not create any kind of paper trail, meaning “there is no way for an administrator to know this token exists and where it circulates.” When a token has full-access permissions like this one did, the results can be potentially disastrous.
Fortunately, Wiz explains that it reported the issue to Microsoft in June 2023. The leaky SAS token was replaced in July, and Microsoft completed its internal investigation in August. The security lapse has only just been reported to the public to allow time to fully fix it.
It’s a reminder that even seemingly innocent actions can potentially lead to data breaches. Luckily the issue has been patched, but it’s unknown whether hackers gained access to any of the sensitive user data before it was removed.
Editors' Recommendations Bing Chat just beat a security check to stop hackers and spammers Microsoft Bing and Edge are getting a big DALL-E 3 upgrade Huge leak reveals Microsoft’s new laptops coming next week Microsoft ‘special event’ set for September – Surfaces and AI announcements likely In the age of ChatGPT, Macs are under malware assault Artificial Intelligence Cybersecurity Microsoft Software Tech News Computing The FBI has warned that hackers are running wild with generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools like ChatGPT, quickly creating malicious code and launching cybercrime sprees that would have taken far more effort in the past.
The FBI detailed its concerns on a call with journalists and explained that AI chatbots have fuelled all kinds of illicit activity, from scammers and fraudsters perfecting their techniques to terrorists consulting the tools on how to launch more damaging chemical attacks.
Computing ChatGPT has been a polarizing invention, with responses to the artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot swinging between excitement and fear. Now, a new survey shows that disillusionment with ChatGPT could be hitting new highs.
According to a survey from security firm Malwarebytes, 81% of its respondents are worried about the security and safety risks posed by ChatGPT. It’s a remarkable finding and suggests that people are becoming increasingly concerned by the nefarious acts OpenAI’s chatbot is apparently capable of pulling off.
Computing Ever since Microsoft started integrating ChatGPT into Bing search, alarm bells have been ringing at Google. Now, though, the tech giant has started rolling out its own generative artificial intelligence (AI) tool for users as part of its bid to retain its search crown.
In a blog post, the company explains that the new feature (called Search Generative Experience, or SGE) is part of Google’s Search Labs, which lets you test out experimental ideas in Google search and provide feedback to the company. Google says its generative AI will “help you take some of the work out of searching, so you can understand a topic faster, uncover new viewpoints and insights and get things done more easily.” Upgrade your lifestyle Digital Trends helps readers keep tabs on the fast-paced world of tech with all the latest news, fun product reviews, insightful editorials, and one-of-a-kind sneak peeks.
