By Trevor Mogg Close Apple’s former design guru Jony Ive is reported to be in talks with prominent AI startup OpenAI to create what’s being dubbed “the iPhone of artificial intelligence.” And if you think that sounds like pie in the sky, then take note: The project could be bankrolled to the tune of $1 billion by Japanese tech giant SoftBank.
OpenAI, the startup behind the trailblazing ChatGPT chatbot , is in advanced talks with Ive and SoftBank chief Masayoshi Son about the potential project, according to a Financial Times report on Thursday.
OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has his sights set on creating the company’s first consumer device, according to several sources who shared details with the FT. A similar report also appeared in The Information this week.

While there’s little information about what form the device might take and what it might do, the suggestion appears to be that it would offer an intuitive way of interacting with AI, with grand ambitions to mirror the iPhone’s success in bringing mobile computing to the masses.
SoftBank’s Son has also been talking to Altman and Ive about the possibility of creating a company to work on developing the device, and while the FT describes the discussions as “serious,” no deal to proceed has yet been inked.
With smartphone innovation slowing after 16 years of astonishing development, it’s hardly surprising that visionaries like Altman and Ive are bringing their own unique talents to the table to discuss ideas for what could turn out to be the next big thing.
Their talks might come to nothing for now, but with generative AI technology developing fast, many will be wondering if the pair just might be onto something.

One of the first that we’ll see in 2024 should be from OnePlus with its flagship OnePlus 12.
The OnePlus 11 is an excellent phone, as we indicated in our review. It’s one of the best phones you can get in 2023, and is right up there with great competitors like the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra, Google Pixel 8 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max.
Mobile If you were hoping that the recently released Apple Watch Ultra 2 will appear with a discount in this year's Black Friday deals, you're in luck because the smartwatch's 49mm, GPS + Cellular model is currently $60 off from Amazon. From $799, the wearable device is down to $739 -- it's still not cheap, but it's rare to enjoy savings when buying an Apple product that's just a couple of months old. There's no telling how long the offer will remain online though, so before it gets taken down, push through with your purchase.
Why you should buy the Apple Watch Ultra 2 We tagged the Apple Watch Ultra 2 as the best premium smartwatch for the iPhone in our list of the best smartwatches, and at first glance, it's obvious why. The 49mm titanium case and Always-On OLED touchscreen will catch anybody's attention because of their size and brightness, while the wearable device itself is very fast and smooth because it's powered by Apple's new S9 chipset. The Apple Watch Ultra 2 can last up to 36 hours on a single charge that may be extended to up to 72 hours in Low Power Mode, and it offers a comprehensive suite of health-related and fitness features. It also comes with the customizable Action button for a more convenient way of accessing your apps.
Mobile Double Tap is one of the coolest features I’ve used on the Apple Watch in a long time. It’s not the most useful, and I don’t find myself using it that often, but when I do have a need to tap my fingers together to activate a function, I’m still at the stage where I think, “Wow, this is a really impressive thing.” Here’s why it’s an example of what Apple does best — and why there’s so much potential for the future in it.
