How to Choose the Right Graphics Card for Your PC The first and most important thing to know before choosing a graphics card is what sort of resolution and refresh rate you want to go for; the higher of each, the more power you’ll need. If you’d like to go for 1080p, most lower to mid-range cards should handle it just fine at 144Hz, even with a high graphical setting. If you’d like to go for a 2k resolution, then mid-range cards are the minimum, and if you want to hit 144Hz with high graphical settings, then mid-to-high-end cards is the way to go. 4k resolutions are another beat altogether; even the highest-end cards will struggle to hit 144Hz at high graphics, so you will likely have to lower your graphics quality significantly, which might end up defeating the purpose of what you’re doing.
Of course, if you’re going into competitive sports seriously, then you’ll want to get a gaming monitor that can push several hundred frames per second on a low resolution like 1080p. In that case, mid-tier GPUs should be able to handle it fine, although, again, it depends somewhat on the graphical settings you go for. The best bet is to look at the card that interests you, then check it’s performance on the sort of games you’d like to play to give you an idea of what to go for. Also, bear in mind that monitors with higher resolutions and refresh rates can get pretty expensive, so if you’re going for the best card and the best monitor, you can easily go over $2k and into $3k.
