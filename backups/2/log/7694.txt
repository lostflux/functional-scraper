He packs a lot into an ambitious 150-minute runtime, interweaving light and dark tones to mostly positive results. The Guardians still have their comedic bond intact in what is surely one of the gloomiest MCU entries yet.<\/span><\/p>\r\n "p1\"> "s1\">Gunn\u2019s third Guardians film isn\u2019t his best franchise entry, but it\u2019s a substantial step up from Phase Five\u2019s unfortunate introduction. The MCU magic isn\u2019t what it once was, but Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3<\/i> is a solid conclusion to a rather consistent trilogy that sincerely wants only the best for its charming ensemble. This sequel is overlong, overstuffed, and tonally inconsistent, but it still rouses all of the pivotal feelings that any MCU viewer is looking for.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n Rocket's origin story<\/h2>\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_3350382\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"720\"] "wp-image-3350382 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/www.digitaltrends.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol.-3-Baby-Rocket-voiced-by-Bradley-Cooper.jpg?fit=720%2C720&p=1\" alt=\"'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3' Baby Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper) with a sad look on his face.\" width=\"720\" height=\"720\" \/> Marvel Studios[\/caption]\r\n "p1\">The opening Marvel logo makes it clear that Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3<\/em> is focused on its titular group, rather than the ever-growing multiverse, as it replaces the flashing images contained within each letter with the Guardians themselves. Gunn opens on caged baby raccoons with petrified looks in their eyes, while an ominous hand reaches in to grab one of the cowering creatures with malice. This is the beginning of Rocket's (Bradley Cooper) origins that gave the world the endearingly snarky genius. However, the memories to follow compose of the inescapable nightmares that Rocket could never break free from.<\/p>\r\nFade into present-day Knowhere, where Rocket broods among an emotionally fractured superhero team to Radiohead's Creep<\/em>. A drunken Peter Quill (Chris Pratt), also called Star-Lord, mourns over his love, Gamora (Zoe Saldana), after her 2014 variant appears in the modern day without any memory of her fellow Guardians. Meanwhile, Drax (Dave Bautista), Groot (Vin Diesel), Mantis (Pom Klementieff), and Nebula (Karen Gillan) join forces to put the community back together. In flies the powerful Adam Warlock (Will Poulter), whose clash with the Guardians leaves Rocket in critical condition. The team will have to travel to the raccoon's most painstaking memories to restore his health before it's too late.\r\n\r\n[dt-video-embed id=\"3348867\" ]\r\n\r\nThe Guardians realize they know very little about Rocket, discovering that the cruel High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Iwuji) created him. However, he refuses to allow Rocket his freedom, unleashing all of the tricks up his sleeve to capture his invention for his own villainous plans that risk countless lives.\r\n\r\nStar-Lord was at the forefront of the two previous installments, and he's still the glue that holds the group together in several ways.\u00a0 Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3<\/em> emphasizes how each member is an outsider of sorts, but that they each play an instrumental role in this chosen family. Gunn occasionally plays his MCU exit a bit too safe, still relying on a familiar third-act CGI light show and tempered stakes. Nevertheless, his affection for these characters is deeply felt, which translates into an overall enjoyable actioner.\r\n Tugging on the heartstrings<\/h2>\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_3350383\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"720\"] "wp-image-3350383 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/www.digitaltrends.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol.-3-Nebula-Karen-Gillan-Star-Lord-Chris-Pratt-and-Drax-Dave-Bautista.jpg?fit=720%2C720&p=1\" alt=\"'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3' Nebula (Karen Gillan), Star-Lord (Chris Pratt), and Drax (Dave Bautista) wearing black and red uniforms, walking along a metal ship hallway.\" width=\"720\" height=\"720\" \/> Marvel Studios[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe first two installments of the Guardians of the Galaxy trilogy had a zany sense of humor mixed with moments of heavy sentimentality, such as Star-Lord's connection to family.\u00a0 Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3<\/em> is all about the unresolved traumas that loomed beneath the surface of the two prior films, with Rocket's origin story at the forefront. Nevertheless, other ensemble members face identity issues, weaving a common, unspoken thread that finally comes to a head. In the face of Rocket's mortal danger, the Guardians' banter remains mostly intact. Drax and Mantis' shenanigans from The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special\u00a0<\/em>translate into this sequel, giving Bautista and Klementieff more breadth for their sincere interactions, which range from silly to moving.\r\n\r\nThe antagonist doesn't fare quite as well. The High Evolutionary is a savage villain that earns every ounce of hatred from the audience through his reprehensible inhumanity, but he's no more memorable than the typical MCU antagonist. Iwuji plays this character with an over-the-top performance that only further highlights the character's hollow presence. Meanwhile, Poulter's debut as the long-awaited Warlock is welcome, although it's a very minor, underutilized role.\r\n\r\n "alignnone size-large wp-image-3351160\" src=\"https:\/\/www.digitaltrends.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/guardians-vol.-3-2.jpg?fit=720%2C720&p=1\" alt=\"Nebula carries Star-Lord's limp body in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3.\" width=\"720\" height=\"404\" \/>\r\n\r\nGunn approaches Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3<\/em> as a farewell piece, rather than an open-ended prompt for another filmmaker to pick up the slack. As a result, there isn't much attention paid to fresh supporting characters, antagonists, or worldbuilding. It's refreshing to see the Guardians be the stars, rather than serving as a vehicle to ramp into the next chapter of the multiverse. Casual MCU moviegoers won't connect with it on the same level as dedicated viewers, who committed the time to develop feelings for the team of misfits.\r\n\r\nMarvel's increase in production across its feature films and [internal-link post_id=\"3334951\" sponsored=\"false\"]Disney+ series[\/internal-link] had diminishing returns, which also became apparent in the visuals that appeared on the screen. Fortunately, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3<\/em> boasts cleaner CGI than many of its franchise predecessors, especially when it comes to bringing its furry creatures to life. Rocket's backstory is particularly impactful thanks to wonderfully expressive creatures that communicate waves of emotion and empathy.\r\n A solid final bow from James Gunn's MCU run<\/h2>\r\n[dt-video-embed id=\"3352057\"]\r\n\r\n Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3<\/em> won't convert MCU non-believers, as it still embraces many of the long-running franchise's tropes and storytelling techniques, for better and worse. Gunn's farewell is aimed at fans who developed a bond with these characters since their introduction. It's a step down from the first Guardians movie, although it's an improvement on\u00a0 Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2<\/em>. The trilogy wrap-up is the solid installment that Phase Five needed after the muddled Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania.<\/em>\r\n\r\nGunn has a robust understanding of the superhero landscape, but most importantly, he knows that the oddball ensemble is his trilogy's primary currency. There are plenty of CGI creatures and explosions, yet the action is ultimately the least compelling part of it all.\u00a0 Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3<\/em> concludes Gunn's trilogy on a positive note, reminding us why we ever fell in love with this band of misfits, and giving us even more reasons to look back on their journey with fondness.\r\n\r\nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is now playing in theaters nationwide.

Phase Five introduced the Multiverse Saga, which provided hot-ticket directors with the opportunity to inject their own style into the expansive superhero franchise. Chloé Zhao’s Eternals and Taika Waititi’s Thor: Love and Thunder hit a divisive note, while Destin Daniel Cretton’s Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings and Ryan Coogler’s Black Panther: Wakanda Forever earned praise for their respective approaches. Next, Peyton Reed’s Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania put the saga into deep water with a dreadful first installment to Phase Five.
Rocket’s origin story Tugging on the heartstrings A solid final bow from James Gunn’s MCU run All eyes are on James Gunn and his ability to close out his tenure in the MCU with a bang in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 , as he has more on the line than his franchise legacy. Comic book movie fans are also evaluating how he concludes this era of his career, as Gunn now co-heads DC Studios along with Peter Safran. He was never the type of filmmaker to play it safe, extending back to his Troma days.
7 things the MCU should do in a revised Multiverse saga Who dies at the end of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3? James Gunn made 600 versions of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a Gunn retrospective of sorts, compiling his squirmy body horror and winking sense of humor into an emotional package that aims to do right by the ragtag misfits that audiences came to know and love. He packs a lot into an ambitious 150-minute runtime, interweaving light and dark tones to mostly positive results. The Guardians still have their comedic bond intact in what is surely one of the gloomiest MCU entries yet.
Gunn’s third Guardians film isn’t his best franchise entry, but it’s a substantial step up from Phase Five’s unfortunate introduction. The MCU magic isn’t what it once was, but Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a solid conclusion to a rather consistent trilogy that sincerely wants only the best for its charming ensemble. This sequel is overlong, overstuffed, and tonally inconsistent, but it still rouses all of the pivotal feelings that any MCU viewer is looking for.
Rocket’s origin story Marvel Studios Image used with permission by copyright holder The opening Marvel logo makes it clear that Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is focused on its titular group, rather than the ever-growing multiverse, as it replaces the flashing images contained within each letter with the Guardians themselves. Gunn opens on caged baby raccoons with petrified looks in their eyes, while an ominous hand reaches in to grab one of the cowering creatures with malice. This is the beginning of Rocket’s (Bradley Cooper) origins that gave the world the endearingly snarky genius. However, the memories to follow compose of the inescapable nightmares that Rocket could never break free from.
Fade into present-day Knowhere, where Rocket broods among an emotionally fractured superhero team to Radiohead’s Creep.
 A drunken Peter Quill (Chris Pratt), also called Star-Lord, mourns over his love, Gamora (Zoe Saldana), after her 2014 variant appears in the modern day without any memory of her fellow Guardians. Meanwhile, Drax (Dave Bautista), Groot (Vin Diesel), Mantis (Pom Klementieff), and Nebula (Karen Gillan) join forces to put the community back together. In flies the powerful Adam Warlock (Will Poulter), whose clash with the Guardians leaves Rocket in critical condition. The team will have to travel to the raccoon’s most painstaking memories to restore his health before it’s too late.
The Guardians realize they know very little about Rocket, discovering that the cruel High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Iwuji) created him. However, he refuses to allow Rocket his freedom, unleashing all of the tricks up his sleeve to capture his invention for his own villainous plans that risk countless lives.
Star-Lord was at the forefront of the two previous installments, and he’s still the glue that holds the group together in several ways.
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 emphasizes how each member is an outsider of sorts, but that they each play an instrumental role in this chosen family. Gunn occasionally plays his MCU exit a bit too safe, still relying on a familiar third-act CGI light show and tempered stakes. Nevertheless, his affection for these characters is deeply felt, which translates into an overall enjoyable actioner.
Tugging on the heartstrings Marvel Studios Image used with permission by copyright holder The first two installments of the Guardians of the Galaxy trilogy had a zany sense of humor mixed with moments of heavy sentimentality, such as Star-Lord’s connection to family.
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is all about the unresolved traumas that loomed beneath the surface of the two prior films, with Rocket’s origin story at the forefront. Nevertheless, other ensemble members face identity issues, weaving a common, unspoken thread that finally comes to a head. In the face of Rocket’s mortal danger, the Guardians’ banter remains mostly intact. Drax and Mantis’ shenanigans from The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special translate into this sequel, giving Bautista and Klementieff more breadth for their sincere interactions, which range from silly to moving.
The antagonist doesn’t fare quite as well. The High Evolutionary is a savage villain that earns every ounce of hatred from the audience through his reprehensible inhumanity, but he’s no more memorable than the typical MCU antagonist. Iwuji plays this character with an over-the-top performance that only further highlights the character’s hollow presence. Meanwhile, Poulter’s debut as the long-awaited Warlock is welcome, although it’s a very minor, underutilized role.
Marvel Studios Gunn approaches Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 as a farewell piece, rather than an open-ended prompt for another filmmaker to pick up the slack. As a result, there isn’t much attention paid to fresh supporting characters, antagonists, or worldbuilding. It’s refreshing to see the Guardians be the stars, rather than serving as a vehicle to ramp into the next chapter of the multiverse. Casual MCU moviegoers won’t connect with it on the same level as dedicated viewers, who committed the time to develop feelings for the team of misfits.
Marvel’s increase in production across its feature films and Disney+ series had diminishing returns, which also became apparent in the visuals that appeared on the screen. Fortunately, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 boasts cleaner CGI than many of its franchise predecessors, especially when it comes to bringing its furry creatures to life. Rocket’s backstory is particularly impactful thanks to wonderfully expressive creatures that communicate waves of emotion and empathy.
A solid final bow from James Gunn’s MCU run Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 won’t convert MCU non-believers, as it still embraces many of the long-running franchise’s tropes and storytelling techniques, for better and worse. Gunn’s farewell is aimed at fans who developed a bond with these characters since their introduction. It’s a step down from the first Guardians movie, although it’s an improvement on Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2.
 The trilogy wrap-up is the solid installment that Phase Five needed after the muddled Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania.
Gunn has a robust understanding of the superhero landscape, but most importantly, he knows that the oddball ensemble is his trilogy’s primary currency. There are plenty of CGI creatures and explosions, yet the action is ultimately the least compelling part of it all.
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 concludes Gunn’s trilogy on a positive note, reminding us why we ever fell in love with this band of misfits, and giving us even more reasons to look back on their journey with fondness.

There are too many of them in the marketplace, they argue, and no one cares anymore. Yet, 2022 saw five of the top 10 highest-grossing movies being based on comic books, suggesting the genre still has plenty of life left in it.
This year is no different, as there are over a dozen comic book movies and shows set to hit screens big and small. These five films stand out from the crowd for both their potential to be great (The Flash) and their promise to honor what has come before them (Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3).
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (February 17) Marvel Studios’ Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania | New Trailer Entertainment It's time to face the music as Peter Quill, Drax, and the rest of the Guardians gear up for one final mission in the first trailer for Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3. Marvel President Kevin Feige and director James Gunn revealed the trailer today at the 2022 Comic-Con Experience (CCXP) in São Paulo, Brazil.
As Chris Pratt's Peter Quill says in the trailer, "The galaxy still needs its Guardians." Reprising their roles as the Guardians are Pratt as Quill/Star-Lord, Dave Bautista as Drax, Karen Gillan as Nebula, Pom Klementieff as Mantis, Vin Diesel as Groot, and Bradley Cooper as Rocket. Zoe Saldaña returns to the franchise as Gamora, Thanos' adopted daughter. Gamora died in Avengers: Infinity War, but returned as a younger version of the same character in Avengers: Endgame.
Entertainment There was a period in the 1960s when Marvel Comics ruled the world of monsters. Series like Tales to Astonish and Journey Into Mystery introduced readers to one terrifying -- and typically, giant-sized -- creature after another, years before Marvel turned its full attention to superhero stories.
The ubiquitous success of the Marvel Cinematic Universe these days seems poised to transform Marvel's monster era into a relic of simpler (and perhaps, weirder) times, but Disney's Werewolf By Night suggests the studio isn't ready to cast it aside just yet.
