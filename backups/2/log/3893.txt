The AI rules that US policymakers are considering, explained Artificial intelligence is suddenly everywhere — or at least, that’s what it seems like to us at Vox. Even in its current form and with its limitations, the tech is already shaping everything from text and image generation to how we live and work.
Generative AI tools, like ChatGPT, Stable Diffusion, and DALL-E, are systems designed to produce something new based on its previous experience. Some of these can be accessed online for free or for a low-cost subscription.
It’s only the beginning of this tech, so it can be hard to make sense of what exactly it is capable of or how it could impact our lives, but so far, it’s impressive. We’re committed to answering the biggest questions surrounding it, and sharing what we know.
