Neuralink’s first in-human study, called PRIME ( P recise R obotically Im planted Brain-Computer Interfac e ), is encouraging interest from those with quadriplegia due to cervical spinal cord injury or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). They should also be at least 22 years old and have a consistent and reliable caregiver.
Musk said in 2022 that he intended to have the device implanted in his own brain, but it seems unlikely that he will be among the trial’s first batch of participants.
Neuralink demo shows monkey performing ‘telepathic typing’ Elon Musk plans ‘show and tell’ event on brain-computer technology Elon Musk to take Twitter CEO role for the first few months Formed in 2016, Neuralink is developing a technology that connects the human brain with a computer interface for a system that enables those with neurological conditions to communicate with and control various devices. A person with paralysis, for example, could potentially use their phone merely by imagining their hand movements. In the long term, however, the ever-ambitious Musk suggests that the technology could equip humans with “superhuman cognition.” Before attempting to reach those lofty heights, Neuralink says it wants to use the PRIME study to evaluate the safety of its N1 implant and its R1 surgical robot. It will also assess the initial functionality of its brain-computer interface (BCI) for enabling those with paralysis to control external devices with their thoughts.
“During the study, the R1 robot will be used to surgically place the N1 implant’s ultra-fine and flexible threads in a region of the brain that controls movement intention,” Neuralink explained in a post on its website. “Once in place, the N1 implant is cosmetically invisible and is intended to record and transmit brain signals wirelessly to an app that decodes movement intention.” It added that the initial goal of its BCI is to “grant people the ability to control a computer cursor or keyboard using their thoughts alone.” The PRIME study is being carried out under the investigational device exemption (IDE) awarded by the FDA in May and, according to Neuralink, represents a significant step in its bid to develop a generalized brain interface to bring autonomy to those with unmet medical needs.
Neuralink last year shared a video of a monkey with the BCI playing Pong merely by thinking about it.
 It was also able to move a mouse cursor using the same method. However, the company has faced criticism for using animals in its research despite its insistence that it always treats them with care. Earlier this month, Musk responded to claims that 15 out of 23 monkeys implanted with the device have since died, saying : “No monkey has died as a result of a Neuralink implant,” adding that with its early animal trials, it used terminally ill monkeys to minimize the risk to healthy ones.
Other companies have already developed similar technology to Neuralink’s. BrainGate, for example, has enabled a man with paralysis to communicate his thoughts by converting his imagined handwriting into text.
It’s still early days for Neuralink, but it’s hoped that its own technology could one day lead to real-world benefits for people with paralysis, or even fulfill Musk’s grand hopes of achieving something far greater.
Editors' Recommendations Elon Musk’s Neuralink gets FDA nod to test brain implant in humans Elon Musk officially owns Twitter now: a timeline of how we got here Brain-computer interfaces have been implanted in humans for the first time Elon Musk offers new date for first Starship orbital flight Elon Musk predicts date for first crewed landing on Mars News Tech for Change Tech News The Food Fight Space SpaceX may have lost a bunch of its Starlink internet satellites last week, but it looks to have found 150,000 new Starlink customers in recent months.
A tweet posted by SpaceX boss Elon Musk on Monday, February 14, said simply: “Over 250k Starlink user terminals" -- that's 100,000 more than it reported last August.
Space SpaceX is planning to launch and land its next-generation Starship rocket on an ocean-based spaceport as early as next year.
Starship could one day carry up to 100 crew members to the moon, Mars, and beyond. The powerful launch vehicle may also be used for city-to-city travel, bringing global cities closer together than ever before.
News Elon Musk’s Neuralink company has just posted a video showing a monkey playing Pong, apparently using only his mind.
It’s a demonstration of Neuralink’s implantable "brain-machine interface" that it has been working on since 2017. The company claims the technology will one day allow our minds to interface with gadgets and programs, and could one day help to treat brain disorders.
