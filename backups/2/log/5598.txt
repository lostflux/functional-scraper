Despite that, itâ€™s a highly requested feature â€” and one that Microsoft might be about to make a reality.
According to Windows enthusiast @thebookisclosed on Twitter, a moveable taskbar is something Microsoft is at least considering, as evidenced by a video of the feature in action that was shared on the accountâ€™s Twitter page.
Turns out you can position the fully XAML taskbar up top, the experience is not all that great though ðŸ˜… pic.twitter.com/NmGjOVK0gR &mdash; Albacore (@thebookisclosed) March 6, 2023 In the tweet, the taskbar has been repositioned to the top of the display â€” something not currently possible in Windows 11.
 While that might seem like progress to the users who have been clamoring for this, itâ€™s clearly far from ready.
As the video shows, when a user clicks or hovers over the icons on the taskbar when it is located at the top of the display, things start to go very wrong.
Windows 11 will soon harness your GPU for generative AI â€˜Compact Modeâ€™ canâ€™t fix the Xbox app. Hereâ€™s what could Surprise: Windows 11 is doing much better than we thought For instance, clicking the Start menu icon opens the menu in the bottom-left corner of the screen, despite the icon occupying the top-center area of the display. Clicking the search box, meanwhile, launches the Windows search window at the bottom of the screen.
Not yet ready for prime time Microsoft Things are just as broken when the user clicks app icons, and in each case, the app or tool opens at the bottom of the display, despite the taskbar still being located at the top. Clicking the arrow to open the notification area, meanwhile, seemingly does nothing at all (aside from spinning the arrow icon).
The ability to move the taskbar is apparently part of Windows 11 Insider Preview Build 25309.
 Whether or not it rolls out to a full release is anyoneâ€™s guess, and Microsoft has previously said there were a number of challenges with implementing this feature.
Based on the current evidence, thereâ€™s still a long way to go to make it properly functional. Still, if youâ€™ve been craving a little more customization in Windows 11 , it could be something to keep an eye on.
Editors' Recommendations Windows is just an application now Windows 11 might finally reverse course on preinstalled applications A major Windows update just launched. Hereâ€™s whatâ€™s new I love Macs. But here are 5 reasons I keep coming back to Windows This simple keyboard shortcut could save you when installing Windows 11 Microsoft Microsoft Windows Tech News Windows 11 Computing If you've just upgraded to the latest version of the Windows operating system, Windows 11, you're probably ready to dive in and customize its appearance. One easy way to customize Windows 11 is by adding a theme. And if you're in need of some Windows 11 theme inspiration, have a look at our list of the best Windows 11 themes.
Below, you will find some of our current favorite themes for the Windows 11 OS and why we enjoy them.
Explore native Windows 11 themes first Computing Did we just get a confirmation about the release time frame for Windows 12 -- and from Intel, of all sources? It seems that way. Intel spoke about its predictions for 2024, indicating that it expects 2024 to be a good year for client processors. That's huge for Intel because the next generation of its top processors, Meteor Lake, is set to come out in 2024. However, if Intel is right, it might be a big year for Microsoft, too.
The information comes from a transcript of the Citi 2023 Global Technology Conference. Most of it wasn't too exciting -- fireside chats aren't often that interesting to the masses -- but there's a little comment in there that piqued our interest.
Computing In the consumer space, Windows 11 adoption has been ticking along at a reasonable pace. For businesses, however, the OS may have reached its limit, as businesses struggle to upgrade machines to meet the minimum requirements.
IT asset management group Lansweeper has observed that the adoption of Windows 11 now stands at 8.35% as of October 2023, a slight jump from the 5.74% seen in September 2022. However, having conducted research on approximately 33 million Windows devices in the enterprise sector, Lansweeper has concluded that it is largely device incompatibility that is stalling Windows 11 updates on a grand scale.
