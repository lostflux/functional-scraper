Now, the latest rumor suggests that it will be fixing one of the biggest mistakes of the OnePlus 11 and the OnePlus Open : the lack of wireless charging.
According to reliable leaker Max Jambor on X (formerly Twitter), the OnePlus 12 will revive wireless charging. Not only will it bring back wireless charging, but it will also wirelessly charge at 50-watt speeds to boot. This wireless charging rumor is also being touted by Digital Chat Station on Chinese social network Weibo.
OnePlus 12 does indeed bring back wireless charging at 50 Watts! &mdash; Max Jambor (@MaxJmb) October 23, 2023 There’s a bit of history behind OnePlus and wireless charging. For years, the brand said that it was hesitant to include wireless charging because it was too slow. But when it released the OnePlus 8 Pro, OnePlus 9 Pro, and OnePlus 10 Pro with wireless charging at 50-watt speeds, it impressed many. However, when the OnePlus 11 came out, wireless charging was mysteriously absent. OnePlus often brings up that fast charging via a cable is more useful since you can use your phone while it charges.
OnePlus also just released its first foldable, the OnePlus Open, with a price tag of $1,700. But even its most expensive phone doesn’t have wireless charging, even though its competitors, the Google Pixel Fold and Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 , do.
Christine Romero-Chan / Digital Trends At some point earlier this year, OnePlus did say that it was considering adding wireless charging back in future releases, but never specified when that would happen.
One of my favorite Samsung features is coming to OnePlus phones The worst thing has happened to one of 2023’s best Android phones 2023’s newest folding phone is already putting Samsung to shame But as we approach the OnePlus 12 launch toward the end of this year or the start of next year, it’s likely we’ll see it return sooner rather than later. This would also make the OnePlus 12 a possible candidate to be one of the first Android phones equipped with Qi2 wireless charging , a technology built on Apple’s MagSafe standard that was introduced at CES 2023.
Editors' Recommendations OnePlus 12: news, rumored price, release date, and more I did a Pixel 8 and OnePlus 11 camera test. Picking a winner wasn’t easy Here’s our first look at OnePlus’ next Apple Watch killer For a $1,700 folding phone, the OnePlus Open has one big flaw OnePlus is about to put the Google Pixel 8 Pro to shame Android OnePlus Tech News Mobile Android 14 is in the final stages of development, and its first stable version is set to release later this month. As a result, Android phone brands are starting to unleash previews of their upcoming software upgrades based on the Android 14 beta, allowing select users to try out forthcoming features before other people. After Samsung opened up One UI 6 beta for a limited number of devices earlier this month, OnePlus is giving us a peek at its upcoming OxygenOS 14 beta based on Android 14.
OnePlus' custom Android skin, OxygenOS, received a major overhaul last year after merging the codebase with the ColorOS interface offered by its parent company, Oppo. Our worst fears came true when OxygenOS 13, based on Android 13, was released last year. It received a radical design overhaul that most OnePlus purists deemed a downgrade that made it nearly indistinguishable from Oppo's ColorOS.
Mobile OnePlus Pad Go OnePlus OnePlus started its journey making fast phones that didn't cost an outrageous amount of money — a strategy that soon trickled down to earbuds and subsequently made its way to the tablet segment. The OnePlus Pad arrived in April, serving a sleek slate with a high-resolution 144Hz screen and a top-tier chip for a price lower than Apple’s entry-level iPad.
Mobile OnePlus is preparing to launch its next flagship phone in the coming months, but a fresh leak predicts an unpleasant surprise. A few weeks ago, purported renders of the OnePlus 12 depicted a phone that borrows heavily from the OnePlus 11 but adds a rectangular lens element at the back to fit a periscope-style telephoto camera.
Now, leaker OnLeaks (via MySmartPrice) has shared updated renders "based on pre-production unit pictures" that don't show any telephoto lens upgrade. Instead, we have three camera lenses with distinct circular lens inlets and a fourth cutout of the same size without any visible lens element on the camera island.
