We used these factors and more to find the best speakers.
Connectivity: Many of the best speakers offer not only wired connections but also wireless connections with Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. Consider what content you plan to play and how you stream your content.
Location : Where you plan to listen to music makes a difference in the type of speaker that you need. For example, if you are looking for something to take with you on the go, you will likely want a smaller, more portable option that is also wireless. If you plan to use your speaker at home in your living room, you likely can benefit from a pair of tower speakers that are more suitable for a larger space.
Style: We love the Marshall Woburn II speaker for its retro design, and the GravaStar Mars Pro has a fun, sci-fi look to it, which makes it even easier to pick the best speaker if style matters to you.
Budget: The cost of the best speakers varies from $180 to $500, but it all depends on which speaker you choose.
What is the best brand of speakers? There are many different brands of speakers that come from many big names. However, we found that the speakers that performed the best came from companies like Sonos and Fluance.
What features should I look for in a speaker? Sound is the most important, so be sure to listen for clarity, bass, and treble in each speaker. There are also other considerations, like whether you need portability or waterproofing.
In addition, think about how you plan to connect, as there are wired speakers, wireless speakers, and Bluetooth speakers.
How much do the best speakers cost? Speakers can vary significantly in cost, so look for a speaker that falls within your budget. The best speakers range in cost from $180 to $500, but you will find speakers that are both more and less expensive.
Are there alternative speakers worth considering? In our search, we also found these alternative best speakers that may also be worth another look: Amazon Echo Dot (4th Gen): Best cheap speaker $24.64 at Amazon KEF LS50 Meta: Best speaker splurge $1,599.99 at Best Buy ZDNET Recommends The best smartwatches you can buy: Apple, Samsung, Google, and more compared The 5 best VPN services (and tips to choose the right one for you) The best Android phones you can buy (including a surprise pick) The best robot vacuum and mop combos (and if they're worth the money) Editorial standards Show Comments Community Guidelines Related The best sound systems you can buy, according to experts The best earbuds you can buy How to choose the best over-ear headphones: ZDNET's buying guide ZDNET we equip you to harness the power of disruptive innovation, at work and at home.
