Announced today at Google I/O 2023 , Wear OS 4 is adding a slew of new features on both a system level as well as an individual app level, meaning that smartwatch owners will be able to have a more streamlined and productive experience when using their devices.
Andy Boxall/Digital Trends Going live later this year, Wear OS 4 will improve battery life for all devices running it. Wear OS has never been known for great battery life, so improvements here are more than welcome. Additionally, the OS update will add “new and improved accessibility features” that include a greatly improved text-to-speech engine that will work faster and be more reliable, resulting in clearer hands-free reading.
While perhaps not immediately exciting for non-developer smartwatch owners, Wear OS 4 introduces Watch Face Format, a tool that allows developers to easily create custom watch faces without having to worry about battery optimization. Although this won’t change much for casual smartwatch wearers when Wear OS 4 goes live, it will result in more exciting watch faces being offered via Google Play later down the line.
Don’t update your Pixel phone — a new Android update might break it Don’t listen to Google. The Pixel Watch 2 isn’t a smartwatch at all Is watchOS 10 causing battery drain? Here’s what we know Beyond Wear OS 4, Google has also announced numerous updates to popular Wear OS apps — including changes to first-party Google apps such as Google Home , Gmail, and Calendar. Smart locks and other devices will now be able to be controlled entirely from watches, emails will be able to be managed and sent using the improved text-to-speech functions, and all Calendar functions will be available without needing to unlock a paired phone.
In addition to first-party app optimizations, the new dedicated WhatsApp Wear OS app allows owners to send messages and make calls right from their wrists. New updates and improvements for Spotify and Peloton will also be coming soon to allow for more seamless app experiences.
In terms of a release date for Wear OS 4, we don’t know much about when it’ll finally be going live other than to expect it “later this year.” When it eventually does launch, we expect the update will be available on the Pixel Watch , the Galaxy Watch 4 , the Galaxy Watch 5 , and the Galaxy Watch 5 Pro as well as on any other Wear OS devices.
Editors' Recommendations The Google Pixel 8 just got its first update. Here’s what’s new Google and Qualcomm are changing Wear OS smartwatches forever Here’s what iOS 17’s coolest feature looks like in action I’ve been using iOS 17 for months. These 4 new things are the best Can my Apple Watch get watchOS 10? Here’s every supported model Android Google Google I/O 2023 Tech News Wearables Mobile The latest version of iOS, iOS 17, comes with a host of new features, including phone call customizations, Live Voicemail, updated iMessage features, and many more. While the update is compatible with many iPhone models, it is not supported by all.
Apple's iOS 17 was announced at the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC 2023) alongside iPadOS, macOS, and more updates. It's an exciting update, but is it one you can get on your iPhone? Which iPhone models can download iOS 17? Apple iPhone 8 Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends Mobile Mobvoi is adding some pizzazz to an otherwise morose color profile for its flagship smartwatch. Starting today, the Mobvoi TicWatch Pro 5 is now available in a new Sandstone finish, which looks quite premium and refreshing at the same time. The price tag stays the same at $350 in the U.S. market.
So far, the Mobvoi TicWatch Pro 5 has only been available in a single Obsidian black trim, which looks clean, but also happens to be an overly prevalent color. An if you're a fan of sandstone or beige colors on your Wear OS timepiece, your only other option is the Galaxy Watch 5 Pro, which is a generation older and also not particularly easy on the eyes.
Mobile The Voice Recorder app on a phone (left) and the Voice Memos on another phone Andy Boxall / Digital Trends Before you head to the app store on your phone to buy a voice-recording app, take a moment to consider the apps that may already be installed on your phone. Why? In my experience, they're likely all you really need. I’ve recorded interviews and voice-overs for work for years, and I’ve found the two best examples come preinstalled on your phone already, so they’re entirely free to use.
