It was every bit as chaotic as you’re probably imagining.
In a promotional stunt supporting the newly released Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name , AEW held a themed match full of references to the series. Dubbed the “Like a Dragon Gaiden Street Fight,” the five-on-five tag team bout featured Kenny Omega, Kota Ibushi, Chris Jericho, and Paul Wight taking on Konosuke Takeshita, Powerhouse Hobbs, Brian Cage, and Kyle Fletcher.
All Gold Ball locations in Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth will kick off a crowded 2024 for RPG lovers Sega explains why it’s officially ditching the Yakuza name for Like a Dragon For fans of the series, the match was full of delightful Easter eggs. Konosuke Takeshita came to the ring in full Goro Majima ring gear (the ring announcers referred to him as a “mad dog”), while Omega’s team got a familiar splash screen referring to them as the Golden Dragons of Dojima.
All Elite Wrestling This was a no-disqualification match, which meant that everyone involved got a chance to replicate the wild action of the RPG series. We saw real-life heat actions, piledrivers through food boards, and back body drops onto plastic palettes. The most absurd sequence of the entire show came when Kota Ibushi rode a bicycle to the ring. That naturally went wrong fast, turning into a melee weapon inside the ring. This is probably the only time you’ll see someone take a brainbuster on top of a bike in a wrestling match.
Kota Ibushi! On a bike! With a pipe!!!

That’s about the tamest way this could have ended, all things considered, so don’t miss the highlight reel.
Editors' Recommendations All Master System game locations in Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name Don’t miss Like a Dragon Gaiden’s hilarious ChatGPT side-story Like a Dragon Gaiden will come with an Infinite Wealth demo Tech News Gaming We've had a dancing game and musou spinoff, but now the Persona 5 cast has entered the realm of tactics with Persona 5 Tactica. The translation feels obvious when you think about it, but naturally, there have to be some changes to make it fit. For fans of the original JRPG, experimenting with the new combat system will take a little getting used to, especially relearning what skills are best. This game is quite friendly to those who are not as well-versed in the genre and allows you to try out your build and completely rework it if you need to. If you've invested your GP in some skills you're unhappy with, here's how you can respec in Persona 5 Tactica.
How to respec in Persona 5 Tactica Each character has their own skill tree that you can invest your GP into for buffs and skills. The way you invest early on can make the first few hours either much more difficult or a smoother experience. If you're feeling some buyer's remorse, respecing any character is not only easy, but can be done as many times as you like at no cost.
Gaming Nintendo’s Super Mario series is so monumental to the medium of video games that you might even think of the mustachioed plumber when you hear “video games” mentioned at all. From his earliest days when he battled Donkey Kong as “Jumpman.” to his latest adventures on the Nintendo Switch, to his latest movie appearance in The Super Mario Bros. Movie, Mario has consistently been one of the greatest characters in video games. He’s such an iconic character that countless video games have had him as the star, and here we have ranked them.
For our list, we had two main criteria. First, the games have to be platformers -- either 2D or 3D. This eliminates Mario sports games, the Mario Kart series, role-playing games, and all the Mario Parties. Secondly, the games have to have Mario himself as the lead character. This eliminated Super Mario Land 3 and Super Mario World 2: Yoshi’s Island. In the end, we were left with 22 games. None of them are bad, but we did have to name a loser. We also chose to omit The Lost Levels and instead considered Super Mario Bros. 2 as the definitive second game in the series.
Gaming Rocksteady made a name for itself as one of the first teams to make a universally acclaimed superhero game with Batman: Arkham Asylum. It followed that success with two sequels, the even more beloved Batman: Arkham City and the divisive, though still fantastic Batman: Arkham Knight. Fans were left waiting to hear what this studio would tackle next. Most assumed it would be another DC property, since it is owned by Warner Bros. Games, and those suspicions turned out to be right on the money, though with a property not many would have predicted.
Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League was given a formal announcement as the newest project from Rocksteady at the DC FanDome event in 2020. At the time, outside of the graphic novels, of course, we only had the one flop of a film based on this antihero group, so many fans were hesitant to see Rocksteady tackle this property. Now that we've gotten a few trailers and footage of gameplay, however, it has become clear that Rocksteady hasn't lost its touch. We took on this suicide mission for you and made off with all the details you need to know about Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League.
