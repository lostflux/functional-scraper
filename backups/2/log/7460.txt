Existing networks can’t keep up What 5G can bring to stores According to the 2022 Connected Retail Experience Study , this will drive a rapid increase in 5G adoption in stores, to the point where it could triple by 2024.
David Dvořáček / Unsplash The study revealed that 93 percent of retailers are expecting in-store phone usage to spike in the next few years. Many are concerned with their ability to manage all that traffic, and will be turning to the deployment of private and hybrid 5G networks in their retail spaces to handle it.
In fact, Verizon and Incisiv believe that moving to 5G will be unavoidable for most retailers as they compete to provide customers with the best in-store experiences and the number of cloud-based store applications spikes in the next few years.
Have an Android phone? You can get unlimited 5G service for free How fast is 5G? What you need to know about 5G speeds The 5G speed race is over and T-Mobile has won What’s pushing retailers the hardest is the increased number of customer mobile devices in stores, followed by the increase in mobile devices used by associates.
Existing networks can’t keep up Although many retailers are happy with the security aspects of their networks, they’re far from satisfied with the core network performance, and that’s only going to get worse as technology deployments and the number of mobile devices both increase Today, most retailers rely on traditional Wi-Fi networks, but these simply can’t deliver coverage and bandwidth nearly as efficiently as 5G technology can, especially in large retail spaces like grocery stores and department stores.
Some retail chains have dipped their toes into the 5G waters, but adoption remains low at only 13 percent. This is expected to triple by 2024-25, with the largest increase found in grocery and general merchandise retailers.
What 5G can bring to stores Not all of these 5G deployments will be customer-facing, of course. Many stores are also looking to private 5G networks for real-time inventory management, mobile point-of-sale systems, digital shelf labels, robotics, and interactive displays.
Retailers interviewed for the study also cited a number of customer experience capabilities that 5G could help deliver, including support for cashierless checkout, mobile apps with in-store features, and even virtual dressing rooms and AR/VR assistants.
Not surprisingly, specialty and department stores leaned more toward things like mobile apps, interactive displays, mobile point of sale, and AR/VR applications, while grocery and general merchandise retailers focused on supporting cashierless checkouts, digital shelf labels, and curbside pickup applications.
According to the study, retailers believe that 67 percent of store tasks will be automated by 2025, with the need for low-latency 5G networks at the core of ensuring seamless real-time communications, but it’s just as much about meeting the needs of customers that are now expecting to live in a far more connected world.
As Jerri Traflet, Verizon’s managing partner of global solutions, explains : “Customers are demanding more in their in-store, mobile, and online experiences, and 5G provides the core capability to deliver those experiences.” The biggest obstacle to 5G deployments among retailers has been the cost and lack of a clear return on investment, but as 5G technology becomes more affordable and their existing wireless networks begin to reach capacity, they’ll have little choice but to turn to 5G to meet the needs of their businesses.
Editors' Recommendations This new MediaTek chip is about to bring 5G to a lot more devices T-Mobile still has the fastest 5G, but its rivals are catching up T-Mobile’s huge lead in 5G speeds isn’t going anywhere Netgear’s new M6 Pro router lets you use fast 5G anywhere you go Live in a rural area? Verizon 5G is about to get better for you 5G Apps Tech News Mobile Each time a new analysis of mobile network performance gets published, it’s almost a given that we’ll see T-Mobile leading the pack in terms of delivering the fastest 5G speeds. After all, the “Un-carrier” had a massive lead in deploying its 5G networks — and it hasn’t been resting on its laurels.
However, its competitors haven’t been sitting still either. While Verizon may have been starting from behind, it’s been aggressively deploying the faster 5G spectrum that gave it a nice leap in 5G performance last year. Still, Verizon and AT&T are lagging quite a bit in overall mobile network performance, and AT&T has fallen even farther behind when it comes to delivering the best 5G speeds across the nation.
Mobile Motorola may be making a play for the flagship market with the Motorola Edge 40 Pro, but budget phones are what the American monolith is best known for. While it won't be making as many waves as the latest Samsung phone or Apple iPhone launch, the newest iteration of the Moto G is always something worth paying attention to, as Motorola is a true veteran of the space and knows what makes an excellent cheap device.
Best of all, this new Moto G comes at a time when budget phone enthusiasts have never had it so good. Previously premium features are filtering down into lower-priced devices, without altering that sweet low price or the features everyone loves. That's exactly what's happening with the new Motorola Moto G Power 5G, which includes a 50-megapixel main camera lens, a larger amount of storage, and a big screen with a 120Hz refresh rate. With the big 5,000mAh battery the G Power range is known for, this could be the $300 phone to grab if you love a budget bargain.
Super-smooth motion Mobile If you’ve been on the fence about picking up one of the latest Galaxy S23 phones, some new research from Ookla may help tip the scales in Samsung’s favor.
