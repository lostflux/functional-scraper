Why trust us? Thunderbolt 5 may help bring back external GPUs, Intel says By Alex Blake Close Intel has just revealed Thunderbolt 5 , which brings a stonking bandwidth increase to the speedy connector. Not only does that mean you’ll be able to charge connected laptops much faster than you can with Thunderbolt 4, but Intel also believes it could breathe new life into a forgotten product for gamers and creatives: the external GPU.
Thunderbolt 5 is a substantial improvement over Thunderbolt 4. The new standard offers 80 gigabits of bidirectional bandwidth — double that of its predecessor — and 120Gbps of bandwidth for external displays.
Razer That’s a threefold increase over Thunderbolt 4 and means you can now power multiple 8K displays or one with a refresh rate up to 540Hz. If you’re after one of the best gaming monitors around, chances are Thunderbolt 5 will be able to handle it.
All that extra speed is great news for data transfers and charging speeds. For one thing, Thunderbolt 5 devices can provide up to 240W of power, meaning many laptops might simply opt for a Thunderbolt 5 slot rather than a separate power port. That should leave more room for other ports on the chassis.
Intel’s new integrated graphics could rival discrete GPUs Intel quietly steps out of the shadows with two new GPUs Intel just gave your Arc GPU double the frames-per-second performance An external GPU ‘resurgence’ CalDigit That extra bandwidth has another implication. In an interview with PC Gamer , Jason Ziller, head of Intel’s Client Connectivity Division, said that it could mean a wholehearted revival of external graphics cards.
A few years ago, it wasn’t uncommon for people to buy a large, separate enclosure that housed one of the best graphics cards and a power supply in order to boost the graphical output of their PC or laptop. That was useful if your laptop wasn’t up to the task, but the expense and bulk meant they never really took off.
Now, though, Ziller thinks Thunderbolt 5 could bring them back into the mainstream. “We also have seen over the years external graphics connected over Thunderbolt ,” Ziller told PC Gamer, “and I think that with the new version doubling bandwidth we will see a resurgence of that category.” That’s not all. Ziller added: “And then I think also going forward over the next few years, we’ll maybe start to see some kind of external AI accelerator products because of the push for AI in the client space.” However, before we get too excited, we’re unlikely to see any Thunderbolt 5-equipped devices hit the shelves until 2024. When they do, though, we could be set for a sizeable speed bump. And perhaps a resurgence of external GPUs, too.
Editors' Recommendations Nvidia may launch three new Super GPUs to fight back AMD What is Thunderbolt 5? Intel’s future GPUs just got revealed in a major leak Intel just proved how powerful Thunderbolt 5 really is Intel admits to one key regret about its launch of Arc GPUs GPUs Intel Tech News Computing Intel seems to be bringing back something that Nvidia and AMD had long given up on: the ability, and the incentive, to use dual graphics cards in a single system.
Multi-GPUs were once a big deal, but the latest generation abandoned that idea for a variety of reasons. However, Intel has allegedly confirmed that you'll be able to use multiple Intel Arc GPUs at once. Will that help Intel capture some of Nvidia's and AMD's customer base? Computing Intel has three new graphics cards coming up, but they don't include the gaming Arc Alchemist that you probably had in mind. The company has just announced the Intel Arc Pro A-series, a new discrete graphics card line made for professionals.
Announced during SIGGRAPH 2022, the range includes the Arc Pro A30M for mobile workstations and the Arc Pro A40 and Arc Pro A50 for small-form-factor desktops.
Computing Intel has just shared a video update regarding the current state of gameplay on its Arc Alchemist GPUs. In a previous video, it was made clear that Intel's cards may struggle with games that aren't running on DirectX 12.
