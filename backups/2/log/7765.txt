Even though Prime Video trails only Netflix in subscriber count , the original content library doesn’t quite excite people the same way.
Prime Video’s first show, Transparent , won multiple Emmys, but it has struggled to find its culture-capturing hit like Stranger Things.
 But with a heavier investment in original programming recently, Prime Video is working to close the gap both in quantity and quality. As more shows release, we’re here to keep you up to date on the best Amazon Prime original series.
We’ve also rounded up the best Netflix original series and the best Hulu original series if Prime Video doesn’t have the originals you’re looking for.

However, it was John Krasinski’s take on the character that made Amazon’s Jack Ryan such a compelling show. Think of it as Jack Ryan Begins.
 This series follows Jack early in his career when he was simply an analyst for the CIA. Regardless, Jack’s ability to make connections and follow the money convinced the CIA to put him into the field long before he was truly ready for it.
Regardless of his lack of field experience, Jack grew into the role and personally took down a terrorist plot. Unfortunately, Jack’s personal life has suffered along the way. Thankfully, the series never disappoints when it comes to thrilling action scenes. Amazon has confirmed that a third season is on the way, which means Jack Ryan will be back in the near future.

Want to stay on top of everything new on Netflix? Every week on Friday, we go over the newly available films to update our list of the best movies on Netflix right now.
Entertainment First, the good news: the actors' strike is over. The bad news is that a combined six-plus months of strikes in Hollywood means there's bound to be a slowdown in new shows in 2024. But since we're still living in 2023 for the next month-and-a-half, we've still got plenty of fresh scripted content to enjoy. This week, we're throwing the spotlight on Apple TV+'s signature series, For All Mankind, Max's Rap Sh!t, and Netflix's Blue Eye Samurai, an anime show that seems to be on the verge of becoming a crossover hit.
Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, Max, Apple TV+, Disney+, Paramount+, and Peacock have spent a lot of money keeping us in fresh new shows week after week. Unfortunately, that's why most of those streaming services are hiking their rates. That's why we suggest going with the ad-supported tiers. In the meantime, keep reading for our weekly roundup of the best new shows to stream.
When you're done here, check out the best new movies to stream this week, as well as the best shows on Netflix, best shows on Hulu, best shows on Amazon Prime Video, and best shows on Disney+.
Entertainment Netflix has grown into one of the best mainstream platforms to stream anime in recent years. Over the years, the streamer has served its animated catalog impressively well. Naturally, that dense library includes anime as well, and thanks to a respectable dose of original series and established hits, Netflix hosts some of the greatest anime to watch, spanning moves and TV shows of every genre a prospective fan could want.
Crunchyroll and Funimation are the primary streamers for the genre. Even so, considering the dominating presence Netflix has in the streaming market internationally, it's a worthy supplement. But even with how relatively mainstream the genre has become westward, it can still feel daunting to know where to start. Thankfully, this guide is consistently updated every month to help you pick from Netflix's library of excellent anime available now.
If you want more options, check out our other guides to the best anime on Hulu and the best anime available on Amazon Prime Video.
