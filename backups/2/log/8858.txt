Here’s why I definitely won’t use it Microsoft September 2023 event: Copilot, Surface Laptop Studio 2, and more Notably, Google Duet and Microsoft Copilot are based on AI that are still a work in progress as they are being marketed as professional tools. Duet is built on Google Bard, while Copilot is an arm of OpenAI’s ChatGPT.
 The language models of both are known for hallucinating false information, among other mishaps. Those using these assistants in a corporate setting are advised to double-check work put through Google Duet.
Editors' Recommendations Google tackles scammers offering malware-laden ‘Bard’ tool Windows 11 is turning into Windows 12 right in front of us Microsoft’s Copilot AI will have an ‘energy,’ apparently I finally upgraded my Google One storage. Here’s why I might never do it again Microsoft accidentally released 38TB of private data in a major leak Microsoft Tech News Computing Microsoft Copilot and Google Duet are the two most prominent artificial intelligence assistants put out by the various tech giants since OpenAI debuted its ChatGPT chatbot in 2022. They're set to bring that powerful natural language assistance into the enterprise in ways that can enhance productivity, improve the digital fluency of workers, and leverage existing data in new and exciting ways.
But which one is best? Both offer comparable features at a comparable cost, but they aren't interchangeable and even getting access to either tool requires a bit of luck. Here's how these two awesome AI tools compare.
Computing From smart speakers to ChatGPT and Bing Chat, AI has slowly crept into our lives, but not all instances of AI are as prominent as those three examples. Sometimes, the effect is subtle, but still pretty nice. It appears that Microsoft is working on one such instance of AI-enhanced tech that could make using Windows 11 just a little more pleasant. We're talking about AI-powered live wallpapers, and they might be coming soon.
First spotted by Windows Latest, Microsoft is readying an AI-powered desktop that could make the whole user experience feel a lot more interactive. The idea is to adjust depth perception and make some backgrounds appear more "alive" when moving your cursor or the entire device. The wallpaper might move or shift, depending on what you're doing on the desktop.
Computing Google announced a full suite of artificial intelligence enhancements for Workspace at its IO event in May. Now, those advanced features are available as Google Duet, and one stands out as a threat to Grammarly's dominance in AI proofreading.
Google Proofread goes much further than the usual spelling and grammar check that's part of Google Docs. It suggests alternate wording to match the context of the document, listing dynamic or formal alternatives.
