Why trust us? Vizio’s new Quantum 4K QLED TVs hit 75 inches for $699 By Simon Cohen Close It’s been a very quiet year for Vizio so far. The company didn’t bring any new TVs to CES 2023 , and the welcome announcement that it was updating its aging smart TV software was tempered by the fact that Vizio wouldn’t say when its customers would be getting the new experience, simply called Vizio Home Screen.
Vizio Quantum 4K QLED Smart TV Vizio Quantum Pro 4K QLED Smart TV Our own editor-at-large and resident TV expert, Caleb Denison, penned an op-ed in July outlining his concerns about Vizio’s apparent retreat to the TV sidelines and what the company would need to do in order to compete with the onslaught of excellent TVs from TCL and Hisense.
Today, Vizio has responded. It’s added two new 4K QLED TVs to its lineup: the Quantum 4K QLED Smart TV and the Quantum Pro 4K QLED Smart TV. These thin-frame TVs are not only the first Vizio models to come with the new Home Screen, but both models are also packed with features like fast Wi-Fi, variable refresh rate (VRR), a built-in menu system for controlling connected Vizio soundbars, and compatibility with all of the most common HDR formats.
The hidden costs of buying a 4K TV are way higher than you think Mini-LED vs. QLED TV: how one technology is improving the other Hisense just debuted the world’s largest mini-LED TV at 100 inches However, they lack one of the things that Denison specifically called for: backlights that use mini-LEDs.
 Still, thanks to their highly competitive prices, this omission may not matter.
The Vizio Quantum 4K is available starting September 21 online and at major retailers including Walmart and Sam’s Club. The Pro model will be available in the coming weeks. Here’s what each TV is offering: Vizio Quantum 4K QLED Smart TV Vizio 65-inch ( $499 ), 75-inch ( $699 ) Full array LED backlight Up to 300 nits maximum brightness Dolby Audio, DTS:X, and DTS Virtual:X, plus Dolby Atmos and DTS:X passthrough Dolby Vision, HDR10+, HDR10, and HLG IPS panel with wide-angle viewing Dual-band Wi-Fi 6 VRR (48Hz to 120Hz in 1080p Full HD mode) AMD FreeSync Premium Auto low-latency mode (ALLM) Voice remote Vizio Home Screen Apple AirPlay 2, Chromecast built-in Apple HomeKit/Amazon Alexa/Google Home compatibility Bluetooth connection for wireless headphones Vizio Quantum Pro 4K QLED Smart TV Vizio The Quantum Pro takes all of the features of the Quantum 4K and adds a higher level of picture and audio performance: 65-inch ($699), 75-inch ($999) Full-array local dimming (FALD) Full-screen brightness of 700 nits, with peak brightness of more than 1,000 nits Anti-reflective film VRR at up to 240Hz FreeSync Premium Pro Tri-band Wi-Fi 6E Soundbar quick attachment Dual-height stand Editors' Recommendations Hisense teases 110-inch, 10,000-nit TV ahead of CES 2024 Sony’s A75L is its most affordable 4K OLED TV so far YouTube TV in 4K: Everything you need to know Samsung’s biggest Neo QLED 8K TV comes with an equally huge price TCL’s latest 98-inch 4K TV comes in at a great price Tech News TV Audio / Video Why wait for a new product to go on sale when you grab a huge discount on day one? That's clearly the thinking behind Hisense's retail launch of its 2023 U8K mini-LED 4K TV, which arrives in stores today. The flagship TV is available in 55-, 65-, and 75-inch screen sizes. Normally, these are priced at $1,300, $1,700, and $2,300 respectively, but for a limited time, Hisense has dramatically reduced all three, which are currently at $800, $1,100, and $1,600.
U8K is the company's flagship TV and marries the impressive benefits of quantum dots with the precise brightness control of mini-LED backlighting. The U8K offers Hisense's best and brightest picture quality -- that is, until (and if) Hisense releases the UX TV it teased at CES 2023. And it's loaded with features that will make it a strong contender if you're looking for a great TV without spending a fortune.
Audio / Video At CES 2023, Hisense promised to bring the U6K mini-LED 4K TV to buyers for under $500. And while it didn't quite make good on that exact wording, we're still impressed that the U6K is now here and available for exactly $500 in the 55-inch screen size. It's available right now at Amazon and at Best Buy, along with the 65-inch ($650), and 75-inch ($848) models.
To put Hisense's achievement in perspective, TCL's most affordable mini-LED TV is the 65-inch QM8, which sells for $1,298.
Audio / Video In May, TCL stunned us with the price of its new Q Class QM8 98-inch TV. At a mere $10,000, it was far less than the cheapest comparable model from Samsung. Today, Samsung is answering that challenge with an impressively low-priced 98-inch model of its own: the , which will be available starting in July for $8,000.
