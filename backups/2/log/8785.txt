Wolfe Close Xiaomi Xiaomi has launched two new wearable devices, the Xiaomi Watch 2 Pro and Xiaomi Smart Band 8. These gadgets are perfect for anyone who wants an excellent smartwatch or fitness tracker to keep tabs on their wellness and fitness goals. They arrived just days after Apple launched the Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2.
The Xiaomi Watch 2 Pro looks like a stylish, durable smartwatch that could be perfect for anyone looking for advanced health and fitness tracking. The watch boasts a classic smartwatch design, with a 1.43-inch always-on AMOLED display that Xiaomi says is clear and easy to read.
The Xiaomi Watch 2 Pro watch case is made of high-quality stainless steel, which looks great and should provide excellent durability. It also runs on Wear OS by Google, meaning you can access your favorite apps and features directly from your wrist.
Xiaomi The Snapdragon W5 + Gen 1 wearable platform powers the watch with a screen resolution of 456 x 466 pixels (326 PPI) and a brightness of up to 600 nits. It also has 2GB of memory and 32GB of onboard storage.
How I use my Apple Watch and iPhone to manage my diabetes The Apple Watch Ultra 2 is (almost) exactly what I wanted Meet the health-focused, anti-Apple Watch you’ll be proud to wear The Xiaomi Watch 2 Pro has seven sensors, including an accelerometer, gyroscope, ambient light, electric compass, barometer, optical heart rate, and bioelectrical impedance analysis sensor. These sensors work together to provide advanced health and fitness tracking, allowing you to monitor everything from your heart rate to your sleep patterns.
One of the most impressive features of the Xiaomi Watch 2 Pro is its battery life. The 495mAh battery can last up to 65 hours between charges, which means you can wear your watch all day and night without worrying about running out of power.
Xiaomi The watch measures 47.6 by 45.9 by 11.8mm and weighs 54.5 grams without a strap. It’s also water-resistant up to 5ATM, which means you can wear it in the shower or when swimming without worrying about damaging it.
The Xiaomi Watch 2 Pro has various strap options, such as fluorubber/leather in orange, green, black, orange, and brown. It also includes 20 watch faces, meaning you can customize the watch to suit your style and preferences.
Earlier this year, Xiaomi introduced the Watch S1 Pro , and the Watch 2 Pro looks like a formidable new entry in its smartwatch range.
Xiaomi The Xiaomi Smart Band 8 is an innovative and stylish fitness device perfect for people always on the go. With its sleek design and powerful features, the Smart Band 8 should be an excellent companion for anyone who wants to stay fit and healthy.
One of the most impressive features of the Smart Band 8 is its 1.62-inch AMOLED display. The display is bright and clear (up to 600 nits) with a refresh rate of 60Hz and a screen resolution of 192 x 490 pixels (326 PPI). The high-precision 6-axis sensor, PPG heart rate sensor, and ambient light sensor allow for sleep monitoring, all-day SpO2 monitoring, and heart rate monitoring. It can even predict female menstrual cycles.
In addition to its impressive display and sensors, the Xiaomi Smart Band 8 is incredibly lightweight and compact. It measures 48 by 22.5 by 10.99mm and weighs just 27 grams, making it comfortable to wear all day. The Smart Band 8 is powered by an Apollo Blue Lite chipset, which provides up to 16 days of battery life with only one hour of fast charging.
The Smart Band 8 has over 200 pre-set watch faces, allowing you to really customize your device. Additionally, it ships with various band options, including leather braided, checkered, double-wrap, and stainless steel, among others. The quick-release design makes switching straps effortless, allowing you to change your look in seconds.
Overall, the Xiaomi Smart Band 8 looks like an excellent choice for anyone who wants to stay fit and healthy while looking their best.
Both the Xiaomi Watch 2 Pro and Xiaomi Smart Band 8 arrive later this year at various price points.
Editors' Recommendations Double Tap is the coolest Apple Watch feature I’ve used in ages You can already use the Apple Watch Series 9’s best new feature How to watch Apple’s iPhone 15 event today: 5 easy ways Garmin’s newest smartwatch could replace your Apple Watch I ditched my Apple Watch 6 months ago. Here’s why I’m going back Health & Fitness Tech News Wearables Mobile As smartphones became mainstream over the past decade, multiple research papers popped up, documenting how extremely filthy they can get. Fresh research from the University of Arizona said that smartphones can be 10 times dirtier than a toilet seat. Another paper published in Nature claimed that microbial infection is so bad that robust public health and biosecurity protocols are needed to minimize the risks.
But over the years, another class of personal devices has become a part of our daily lives — health wearables such as smartwatches and fitness bands. Researchers at Charles E. Schmidt College of Science of Florida Atlantic University studied various types of wearable straps and discovered that nearly 95% of them were contaminated with various forms of bacteria.
Mobile It’s almost time for Apple’s fall event, which means new iPhones and Apple Watches. There’s no doubt that we’ll be seeing the iPhone 15 lineup next month, along with the Apple Watch Series 9. However, it’s a bit unclear if we’ll also see the next iteration of the Apple Watch Ultra, though some sparse rumors seem to point to “maybe.” The first generation Apple Watch Ultra was only released last September, and it has been a big success. It’s the first significant design change for the Apple Watch as a whole, with some impressive new hardware features like the Action Button, much better battery life, and more.
Mobile When Apple announced the Apple Watch Ultra last September, I was excited about it. It wasn’t something that I needed at the time, but I loved that it’s pretty much the first big change for the Apple Watch product as a whole since the Apple Watch Series 5. The design of the Ultra is completely different from the Apple Watch Series 8, and — of course — it has the Action button.
Oh, the Action button. Aside from the Digital Crown and side button, the Apple Watch Ultra has a unique Action button, accented in a bright orange, that lets you quickly launch an action — such as starting a workout, opening the Workouts app, using the Apple Watch Ultra as a flashlight, launching a shortcut, and more. People love the Action button, plenty of them have given it praise, and I thought it was one of the cooler features of the Apple Watch Ultra.
