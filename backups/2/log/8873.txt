Why trust us? Qualcomm finally has an answer for Apple’s M2 coming to PCs By Fionna Agomuoh Close The next wave of Qualcomm PC platforms will come with a rebrand under the name Snapdragon X, which will roll out in 2024, the component supplier recently confirmed.
The company detailed that it will unveil new logos and platform badges for the compute platform to distinguish its premium category while maintaining its standout Snapdragon fireball design. The upcoming Snapdragon X chips will feature the Qualcomm Oryon CPU.
Qualcomm The component has a riveting backstory beginning with Qualcomm’s 2021 acquisition of the brand Nuvia, which was founded by ex-Apple engineers. Qualcomm used the technology of Nuvia’s Arm-based chips to deliver an experience similar to Apple in terms of power and efficiency while adding AI processing and 5G connectivity.
However, Arm has sued Qualcomm and Nuvia, claiming that Nuvia’s licensing agreements with the company are no longer valid now that it has been sold to Qualcomm. The lawsuit is set to go to trial in September 2024, according to the Verge.
Qualcomm says its new chips are 4.5 times faster at AI than rivals Apple Mac Studio vs. Mac Pro: M2 Ultra desktops, compared Apple’s Mac Studio is now officially a tiny Mac Pro with M2 Ultra The devices running the Snapdragon X will be direct competitors with Apple’s M-series lineup, which powers devices across the iPads, MacBooks, and Mac desktop lines. The M-series chips have been known for performance, battery life, and for allowing portable devices to be lightweight. The Snapdragon X will also enable a neural processing unit (NPU), similar to the M-series chips, which Qualcomm said will drive powerful on-device AI experiences on the SoC.
One major one-up Qualcomm has over Apple on its chips is its consistent inclusion of 5G by blending mobile technology into a computing atmosphere. The Verge noted that when at Apple, Nuvia’s founders worked on the A-series iPhone and iPad chips.
Qualcomm’s original Snapdragon 8cx compute platform has already been compared to Apple’s M-series chips. It was first released in 2019 and has seen three generations before this rebrand.
Qualcomm said it will have more details about the Snapdragon X PC platform at its Snapdragon Summit, which will take place later this month.
Editors' Recommendations Qualcomm says Oryon chips are faster than Macs’, but we’ve been here before This tiny ThinkPad can’t quite keep up with the MacBook Air M2 Apple M2 Ultra: everything you need to know about Apple’s most powerful chip Qualcomm claims its laptops destroy Intel chips in AI tasks Intel’s upcoming iGPU might destroy both Nvidia and Apple M2 Qualcomm Tech News Computing Apple's M2 Mac mini brings a long-awaited update to one of the best desktop computers you can buy. Although it's an impressive machine overall, you have to pay close attention when configuring one.
Choosing the wrong parts can result in a Mac mini that's much slower than it should be. We're here to help you choose the ideal configuration for your budget, as well as steer you away from some performance pitfalls with cheaper models.
Here's the M2 Mac mini Computing We just got even more proof that it's high time Apple released a new version of the Mac Pro. Why? Because it just got smoked in a benchmark -- and by a device that costs a tenth of its price.
The M2 Mac mini was tested in single-core and multi-core operations and then compared to the Intel-based Mac Pro. Unsurprisingly, the news is all bad for the expensive 2019 workstation.
Computing Apple's new Mac Mini M2 promises better performance and features at a lower price. But with the next-gen machine now out and making the rounds, you can score a deal on a last-gen Mac Mini M1. Which should you buy? With the same external design and similar port selection, the Mac Mini M2 looks like an internal-only upgrade to Apple's mini desktop. There are some significant differences compared to the M1 model, however, and they can make a huge difference in performance.
