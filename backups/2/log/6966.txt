That’s a shocking range — and if you’re not prepared to change batteries every 90 days, you’ll want to do everything you can do to optimize its performance.

Picking the right Yale Assure Lock 2 Jon Bitner / Digital Trends If you pick a Yale Assure Lock 2 model that has a Wi-Fi Smart Module, your battery life maxes out at around three months. So, if you’re still in the market for a smart lock and battery life is of the utmost importance, consider avoiding these models. Without a Smart Module, you can get up to 12 months of life out of a single set of batteries.
New Wyze Video Doorbell v2 offers microSD card slot, 2K resolution for just $40 What is a smart lock and how does it work? Ecovacs Deebot X2 Omni boasts a new square design and improved vacuuming skills If you already purchased a Yale Assure Lock 2 with a Wi-Fi Smart Module, there’s nothing stopping you from removing it. This will drastically improve your battery life, though note that you’ll no longer be able to access your lock when away from home. It’s a big trade-off, but one that might be worth it if you’re tired of constantly swapping out batteries.
Check your deadbolt position Aside from the Wi-Fi Smart Module, an imperfect installation is often to blame for excessive battery drain. If your deadbolt is rubbing against the strikeplate, consider taking a few minutes to remove the strikeplate and reposition it. Any resistance between the deadbolt and the strikeplate will cause your Assure Lock 2 to work harder than necessary, draining more battery in the process.
Check your Wi-Fi connection Jon Bitner / Digital Trends Just because you’re using a Wi-Fi Smart Module doesn’t mean you’re out of luck when it comes to improving battery life. In fact, it’s possible to squeeze a bit more mileage out of your batteries just by repositioning your Wi-Fi router. The closer it is to the Yale Assure Lock 2, the less battery it’ll need to use.
Unable to move your router? Then try moving objects that sit between your router and front door. A clear path between the two will make it easier for them to communicate — improving your battery life in the process.
Alternatively, you can pick up a Yale Wi-Fi Bridge to sync with the internet instead of your lock’s internal Wi-Fi module. This will reduce battery drain while still giving you the ability to access your lock remotely.
Disable Auto Relocking While it’s nice to have your door automatically lock itself, excessive use of the feature can have a negative impact on battery life. Instead, consider turning this feature off. This can be done by loading up the Yale smartphone app, diving into the Settings menu, and finding the device you want to modify.
From there, simply scroll to the Auto-Lock feature and toggle it to Off.

New Yale Assure Lock 2 models get fingerprint scanner, support for Apple Home keys Blink Outdoor Camera 4 launches with Person Detection, new design, 2-year battery life How long does a Ring Video Doorbell battery last? Home Security Smart Home Smart home gadgets span a wide range of categories. From video doorbells and robot vacuums to outdoor cameras and smart speakers, smart gadgets can be found in all corners of the modern home. Now, thanks to Home Depot, you can now snag the first residential smart door -- and it features a built-in Yale smart lock and Ring video doorbell.
Before you rush out to your local Home Depot, it’s worth noting that this futuristic smart door comes with a hefty price tag of $4,000. Multiple styles are available, including two different sizes and additional sidelites, and depending on your configuration, its price can balloon to an eye-watering $7,000.
Smart Home Most battery-powered Ring video doorbells will last between six to 12 months, with a wide degree of variability depending on your climate, usage, and specific model. If you find your video doorbell falling below that range (or want to optimize its performance), there are several steps you can take to improve your Ring video doorbell's battery life.
From changing your motion settings to adjusting your Wi-Fi settings, here’s how to get a bit more juice out of your battery-powered Ring video doorbell.
Update your motion settings Smart Home If you’re looking for a better way to store your valuables, consider checking out a smart safe. These interesting gadgets may not be as popular as other smart home products (such as smart locks or video doorbells), but they offer a great alternative to traditional, old-school safes.
Aside from letting you access them with a passcode or key, smart safes offer tons of futuristic features – such as fingerprint scanners, remote access via your smartphone, the ability to track when the safe was last opened, and plenty of other ways to customize its performance.
