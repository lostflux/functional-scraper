OpenAI’s intuitive technology products, including ChatGPT and Dall-E 2 , have become internet sensations for their text- and image-generating prowess. Many have speculated about how ChatGPT can practically and morally be used. However, Microsoft is looking to use the company’s AI models in a more functional manner. The company has already implemented a version of the OpenAI GPT text-generator model as an update to its autocomplete feature, according to The Information.
Microsoft has also been testing GPT AI model features on PowerPoint and Outlook. These include functions that allow people to find Outlook search results with AI-driven speech-like commands instead of keywords in an email inbox. Outlook and Word are also getting AI models that use suggested replies to emails or recommended document changes to sharpen writing skills. There is currently no word on whether this use will eventually be built into consumer-facing versions of Microsoft Office, or if the brand is just toying with the potential of the GPT model.
GPT-4 Turbo is the biggest update since ChatGPT’s launch ChatGPT: the latest news, controversies, and tips you need to know ChatGPT’s new upgrade finally breaks the text barrier Still, this practical use of the GPT technology comes after Microsoft invested $1 billion into OpenAI in 2019 and “purchased an exclusive license to the underlying technology behind GPT-3 in 2020,” the publication added.
In addition to its Office suite, Microsoft could be looking to implement the GPT AI model into its Bing search engine in an effort to compete with Google. This could be the product that is most likely to release, with availability speculated for March, according to The Verge.
However, OpenAI’s technology, despite its being remarkable, has a host of pitfalls, including some related to information accuracy and privacy. The brand’s freemium ChatGPT AI chatbot is infamous for filling in the information it does not know with incorrect data, which would especially be a challenge if the model were being developed for a professional use case.
In terms of privacy, The Information said Microsoft has been working to develop its own custom privacy-preserving models based on GPT-3, as well as GPT-4 , which has not yet been released. The company claims it has seen early positive results in “training large language models on private data,” but has not confirmed whether the model is viable enough for a commercial or even business-tier product.
Editors' Recommendations The world responds to the creator of ChatGPT being fired by his own company OpenAI’s new tool can spot fake AI images, but there’s a catch This powerful ChatGPT feature is back from the dead — with a few key changes Most people distrust AI and want regulation, says new survey GPT-4: how to use the AI chatbot that puts ChatGPT to shame Artificial Intelligence Microsoft Tech News Computing The Zoom video-calling app has just added its own “AI Companion” assistant that integrates artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMs) from ChatGPT maker OpenAI and Facebook owner Meta. The tool is designed to help you catch up on meetings you missed and devise quick responses to chat messages.
Zoom’s developer says the AI Companion “empowers individuals by helping them be more productive, connect and collaborate with teammates, and improve their skills.” Computing Ever since the first generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools exploded onto the tech scene, there have been questions over where they’re getting their data and whether they’re harvesting your private data to train their products. Now, ChatGPT maker OpenAI could be in hot water for exactly these reasons.
According to TechCrunch, a complaint has been filed with the Polish Office for Personal Data Protection alleging that ChatGPT violates a large number of rules found in the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). It suggests that OpenAI’s tool has been scooping up user data in all sorts of questionable ways.
Computing GPT-4 -- the large language model (LLM) that powers ChatGPT Plus -- may soon take on a new role as an online moderator, policing forums and social networks for nefarious content that shouldn’t see the light of day. That’s according to a new blog post from ChatGPT developer OpenAI, which says this could offer “a more positive vision of the future of digital platforms.” By enlisting artificial intelligence (AI) instead of human moderators, OpenAI says GPT-4 can enact “much faster iteration on policy changes, reducing the cycle from months to hours.” As well as that, “GPT-4 is also able to interpret rules and nuances in long content policy documentation and adapt instantly to policy updates, resulting in more consistent labeling,” OpenAI claims.
