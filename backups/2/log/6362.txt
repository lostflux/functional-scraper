The tech giant introduced its most affordable Apple Music plan in 2021 but on Wednesday said in a message on its website that it’s ending the ability to sign up to it with immediate effect.
Current subscribers to Voice for Apple Music can use the service until the end of their billing period. The auto-renew function has been turned off.
Apple is encouraging those on the Voice plan to switch either Individual, Student, or Family, or to consider signing up for Apple One, a bundle that includes Apple Music, Apple TV+, and more.
It’s not clear why Apple is retiring Voice, but it’s possible the take-up wasn’t as great as it had hoped.
The Siri-powered Voice tier was useful for those who mainly listened to music in their car or on a HomePod where they just called out tracks, with a library or visual interface being of little importance.
Voice comes with a bunch of limitations, though, which may have proved frustrating for some subscribers. For example, it has a pared-down visual interface with no access to lyrics or music videos. You can’t even make playlists. Downloading for offline listening isn’t possible either, and if you navigate via the interface and select a song, it’ll only play a preview of it – to play the full track you have to ask Siri. Voice also lacks features such as Spatial Audio for a premium listening experience.
Whether you’re a subscriber to Apple Music or not, you can still ask Siri to play particular songs, but only if they’re among your purchased or imported tracks. But to access Apple’s full music library, you’ll now have to pay at least $11 a month, or $6 if you’re a student.

Music, pricing, and features explained What is a network music streamer and why do you need one? Fubo tweaks its plans again, and actually lowers price of one tier Entertainment Mobile Apple Music Streaming Services Tech News Audio / Video Subscribers to Apple TV+ are about to get a big surprise as Apple today raised the price of its Apple TV+ streaming service for the second time in its four-year history, hiking it from $7 to $10 per month. Its annual subscription rate also goes from $69 to $99.
The new prices quietly appeared on the company's website today, but Apple TV+ isn't the only service in its roster to see a price increase: Apple's gaming subscription service, Apple Arcade, has gone from $5 per month to $7 per month and its news subscription, Apple News+ goes from $10 per month to $13 per month. This is the first time either of those services has had their prices increased.
Mobile Apple caused a stir this week by launching a third version of its Apple Pencil. Although it's not unusual for tech companies to release updated versions of their products, it's somewhat confusing as the new Apple Pencil joins the two existing models in the lineup. This means three Apple Pencils are available now, all of which look very similar. Despite the three input devices performing similar tasks, they differ in key areas, as their price differences suggest.
Here's a comparison of the Apple Pencil, Apple Pencil (2nd generation), and the all-new Apple Pencil (USB-C). If you aren't sure which one to buy, you've come to the right place.
Apple Pencil (1st generation) Audio / Video Using the "Find My" app to find an AirTag in an Apple TV remote case is more accurate. Phil Nickinson / Digital Trends Of all the new features in iOS 17 and tvOS 17, one of the ones I was most eager to try was the new "Find My Remote" feature. It doesn't have an official name, and it isn't actually part of the Find My app. But, still. Anything that makes it easier to find a lost remote is a good thing, right?
