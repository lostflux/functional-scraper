By Simon Cohen Close Apple’s latest AirPods Pro are here, and you can buy them for $249. But should you? That’s a lot of money to drop on a pair of earbuds, and there are more AirPods options for you to choose from these days.
New but familiar A new baseline for budget AirPods Need less noise? Want to get lost in your music? What about the AirPods 3? AirPods Pro 2 for the latest enhancements And that’s before you take into consideration that we’re about to go into the Black Friday sales season. All that said, tough decisions are a whole lot easier when you break them down, so that’s exactly what we’re going to do. Here’s how to decide which AirPods you should buy in 2022.
New but familiar Let’s start by going over the full AirPods lineup: $129 Apple AirPods, second-generation (we’ll call them AirPods 2) $179 Apple AirPods, third-generation (we’ll call them AirPods 3) $249 Apple AirPods Pro second-generation (the newest AirPod option yet, aka AirPods Pro 2) $549 Apple AirPods Max And here’s how they stack up for features: AirPods 2 AirPods 3 AirPods Pro 2 AirPods Max Price $129 $179 $249 $549 Battery life per earbud 5 hours 6 hours 6 hours N/A Battery life (total) 24 hours 30 hours 24 hours 20 hours Apple H1 chip Yes Yes Updated to H2 Yes Hands-free Siri Yes Yes Yes Yes Wireless charging No Yes Yes No Active Noise Cancellation No No Yes Yes Transparency mode No No Yes Yes Head-tracking spatial audio No Yes Yes Yes Sweat/water resistance No Yes Yes No Adaptive EQ No Yes Yes Yes Wear sensors Yes Yes Yes Yes Conversation boost No No Yes No A new baseline for budget AirPods Digital Trends Before the release of the AirPods 3, Apple only had two models of true wireless earbuds.
 As such, it priced the regular AirPods 2 at $149 and gave them a $50 wireless charging option that brought the price up to $199 — incredibly expensive for what these basic buds offered compared to the AirPods Pro and virtually all other true wireless models you could buy.
It was high time for rationalization. And in October 2021, Apple yanked the wireless charging option and dropped the price of the standard AirPods 2 by $20. If you’re determined to have wireless charging, Apple will happily sell you a wireless charging case for an additional $79. And while $129 is still arguably too much to pay for a set of earbuds that don’t have ANC, transparency, or wireless charging, their price is a truer reflection of where they sit in Apple’s lineup. These are the AirPods for folks on a budget.
Need less noise? Image used with permission by copyright holder Though many had hoped that the AirPods 3 would offer ANC, Apple has kept that feature (and its companion feature, transparency mode) for its two most expensive products, the AirPods Pro 2 and the AirPods Max.
 These features work beautifully on both headphones , but if you want the ultimate in portability and convenience, the AirPods Pro 2 are the AirPods you should buy if you need to keep a lid on all of the external sounds that threaten to distract you or ruin your tunes.
Want to get lost in your music? Riley Young / Digital Trends The AirPods Pro 2 sound better than ever before, but when it comes to the competition, they’re outclassed by the likes of Sony’s WF-1000XM4 (although the AirPods Pro noise cancellation now reigns supreme). The same is not true of the pricey AirPods Max, which, despite a few minor flaws like the lack of a completely lossless audio connection, are absolutely stunning to listen to.
Whether it’s good ol’ stereo or Dolby Atmos Music from Apple Music, the AirPods Max offer brilliant sound quality and superb ANC and transparency mode. We’d argue they’re still overpriced, but if you want the best audio Apple has to offer, the AirPods Max are the AirPods for you.
What about the AirPods 3? Image used with permission by copyright holder The AirPods 3 have impressed us as an ideal successor to the AirPods 2 in just about every way without costing too much more. Wireless charging, an IPX4 rating, and an extra hour of earbud battery life are handy features that most of us will use daily, along with unique aspects like the AirPods 3 signature upgrade: head-tracking spatial audio.
 Keep in mind that any set of headphones, including the AirPods 2, can let you listen to spatial audio on Apple Music. It’s the head-tracking part that’s unique to the AirPods 3, Pro, and Max.
And as cool as head-tracking can be — we were impressed by how it brings a heightened sense of realism to movies — it’s a bit like 3D movies: fun for the first few minutes, but the effect quickly fades as your brain adapts to the new input. But the other features are valuable additionals, the sound is better, and we absolutely consider the extra $30 worth it to complete your upgrade.
AirPods Pro 2 for the latest enhancements Simon Cohen / Digital Trends Apple changed up the AirPods Pro line significantly in 2022. It discontinued the AirPods Pro entirely and replaced them with the AirPods Pro 2: same price, upgraded H2 chip, and better features all around. That includes better noise cancellation and transparency mode, new water resistance for the charging case, and a touch-based volume slider on the buds. Other minor updates include skin-sensing capabilities in the wear sensors, a slightly better battery life, and an extra ear tip for a wider range of sizes.
If you’re looking for the very latest technology that Apple has to offer — and some of the most advanced tech that earbuds are currently capable of — the AirPods Pro 2 are the choice for you. And while they’re still pricey, the cost hasn’t changed since the first generation, so you’re getting a lot of upgrades without having to pay more for them. That sounds like a win in our book.

Best AirPods Pro deals: Get Apple’s flagship earbuds for $146 Best refurbished AirPods deals: Save on Pro and Max When it comes to charging AirPods Pro with USB-C, don’t overthink it Apple Buying Guides AirPods Apple Buying Guides Audio / Video Amid the slew of new Apple products launched today, only the tiniest mention was made of the fact that Apple has also given the AirPods Pro Gen 2 wireless earbuds a not-so-minor refresh. Along with the expected addition of USB-C, making the AirPods Pro the first Apple headphones to ditch the Lightning connector, Apple has also given the iconic white noise-canceling earbuds the ability to do lossless audio wirelessly -- something that has never been seen on the AirPods family before, and is even a rarity among non-Apple wireless audio devices.
There is, however, a catch. The "groundbreaking wireless audio protocol" that allows for lossless audio at 20-bit/48 kHz (a better-than-CD-quality resolution) is powered by the AirPods Pro's H2 chip, but for now, it only works when paired with the upcoming Apple Vision Pro headset. At the moment, Qualcomm's aptX Lossless Bluetooth codec (when used with compatible wireless headphones and smartphones) is the only technology that supports lossless audio wirelessly, and even that technology is limited to 16-bit/48kHz.
Audio / Video In one of the least-kept surprises of today's iPhone 15 event, Apple announced that the second-generation AirPods Pro are switching to USB-C for their charging case.
That's a big deal because they'll now use the same charger as the iPad and MacBook — and also because they can use any other USB-C cable that you've got laying around. And because we're not talking about a device with a huge battery capacity, you don't need to worry so much about whether you have the right USB-C cable. Things should charge just fine, and fast enough, given that the battery case only sports a 523 mAh battery.
Audio / Video Thanks to constant evolutions in lighting technologies, resolution, and picture upscaling, we can sit closer to our TV screens than ever before. Ideally, you’ll be at least several feet away from your flat-screen when streaming movies and TV shows, but visual maladies like picture noise and that oh-so-dreaded pixelation are becoming far less concerning -- mostly because the best modern TVs are just so dang good! But when it comes to picking the ideal TV size for your living room, bedroom, or cabana, using a few tried-and-true methodologies for determining what screen real estate is best for your viewing space is still recommended.
Luckily, your pals at Digital Trends have plenty of A/V experience and expertise, and we’ve put together this guide to help you figure out what size your new QLED, OLED, or QD-OLED should be.
