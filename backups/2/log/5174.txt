White Close If you thought that the RTX 4090 was already the best we‚Äôll see in this generation, Asus is here to prove you wrong. Nearly a year after the initial launch of Nvidia‚Äôs top graphics card , Asus is about to release the ROG Matrix GeForce RTX 4090 ‚Äî a one-of-a-kind GPU that already has a new world record under its belt.
The GPU is vastly different from a regular RTX 4090 ‚Äî the power delivery system, cooling, and binning process have all received a significant boost. The most visible change lies in the custom 360mm radiator that comes with the ROG Matrix, made to support a liquid cooling system. Aside from the huge radiator, the GPU was also equipped with a custom cold plate that comes attached to the GPU die, memory chips, and VRM section.
Asus Asus has also opted to use liquid metal instead of thermal paste, increasing thermal conductivity in order to keep this beast under control. Liquid metal is challenging to use in GPUs, as you really don‚Äôt want it coming in contact with other components.
To prevent disaster, Asus applied UV resin around the GPU die and also added two extra protective layers between the die itself and the card‚Äôs printed circuit board (PCB) to ensure that the liquid metal wouldn‚Äôt spill over. As a result of these changes, Asus claims that the card can be installed vertically instead of just horizontally, according to VideoCardz.
The wait is almost over!üòé Count down to the official launch of our flagship graphics card ‚Äì the ROG Matrix GeForce RTX 4090. üî• üóìÔ∏èSave the date &amp; tune in LIVE: https://t.co/aIldsPMg5B üî¥Sept 19th, 9:00 AM | New York üî¥Sept 19th, 9:00 PM | Taipei pic.twitter.com/EjcN5CLCU6 &mdash; ROG North America (@ASUS_ROGNA) September 15, 2023 Some enthusiasts already got their hands on the Asus ROG Matrix RTX 4090, and as a result, the GPU has already participated in setting a new world record. It was overclocked to a massive 4,230MHz. However, don‚Äôt expect to hit these clock speeds at home ‚Äî the overclockers had to tear the built-in cooler apart and leverage liquid nitrogen instead. We‚Äôve seen liquid nitrogen used in breaking world records before, such as when the Intel Core i9-13900K processor was pushed past a clock speed of 9GHz.
Here‚Äôs why I‚Äôm glad Nvidia might kill its most powerful GPU Did Nvidia just fix the RTX 4090‚Äôs melting power connectors? This mysterious Nvidia GPU is an absolute monstrosity ‚Äî and we just got another look If Nvidia doesn‚Äôt release an RTX 4090 Ti , this will probably be the most powerful graphics card of this generation. However, this GPU will need a massive PC case in order to comfortably fit, and any and all external cooling is always welcome.
We‚Äôre not sure how much this new RTX 4090 is going to cost, but ‚Äúa lot‚Äù is a pretty safe bet. Asus is hosting a launch event on September 19, and while it‚Äôs unclear whether that is also the release date of the GPU, it seems quite likely.
Editors' Recommendations I tested AMD‚Äôs RX 7800 XT against Nvidia‚Äôs RTX 4070, and there‚Äôs a clear winner Nvidia‚Äôs peace offering isn‚Äôt working Forget the RTX 4060 ‚Äî here are 5 GPUs you should buy instead Nvidia‚Äôs RTX 4060 might not be such a disappointment after all Why Nvidia‚Äôs brand new GPU performs worse than integrated graphics News GPUs Tech News Computing Over the past few months, we‚Äôve seen frequent reports of melting power connectors on Nvidia‚Äôs RTX 4090 graphics cards, leading to a wave of worry and speculation that something is seriously amiss. Now, a user has claimed their cable has melted in a dramatic new way -- and it could suggest that the headaches are far from over for Nvidia.
According to Shiftyeyes67k on Reddit, the 12VHPWR cable that came with their RTX 4090 GPU melted on the power supply (PSU) side. In other words, the problem occurred where the cable connectors fed into the power supply, not where they met the graphics card, as has been the case with every other report of melting 12VHPWR connectors.
Computing Nvidia has just quietly announced the official release date of the RTX 4060. The GPU is coming out on June 29 and will be priced at $299.
Although performance-wise, the RTX 4060 can't hope to compete against some of the best graphics cards, it's still one of Nvidia's most important GPUs. Can it repeat the success of its predecessors? Computing It looks like Nvidia's upcoming RTX 4060 might arrive sooner than expected. Although initial predictions put its arrival sometime in July, Nvidia may still launch it before June is over.
With a questionable set of specifications, but a highly affordable price, will the RTX 4060 become one of this year's best GPUs?
