I'm Ian Hecox Together we are Smosh.
And you're watching the Wired Auto Complete Interview.
[upbeat music] Friendship always wins.
[hands slapping] [upbeat music] Okay, where is- [Both] The old Smosh? Oh, we're right here, baby.
We're right here.
[Producer] There's a second strip.
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my God.
Where is the old Smosh house? That is in Sacramento.
The address leaked.
A lot of people started showing up to our house when we were living there.
People found it on Google Maps and then labeled it as a place of worship.
It doesn't anymore, but I'm sure some of you at home could change that.
Make it a place of worship again.
Why is Smash House blurred? Because we had many a stalker.
Well, not technically stalker.
There was a couple- Do you remember one time when we were editing Food Battle and there were 10 or 20 people outside, and around, and about the house, and they were bringing the doorbell.
Ding dong, ding dong, ding dong, ding dong.
Yeah, yeah.
I remember you went around the house while I was editing and you were closing all the blinds.
Oh yeah, I think a lot of the people that showed up to our house were completely harmless.
It was just like a lot of bored teens.
And when you're a teenager growing up in Sacramento and you have a bike, it's like, yeah, why not just go try to say hi to the Smosh boys.
Yeah, it was probably harmless, but also a little scary.
A little scary.
A little scary, a little bit.
When was Smosh's first video? The first video that we uploaded to YouTube was November 19th, 2005.
But we didn't know YouTube existed at all.
It was just uploaded to smosh.com.
That was the Power Ranger's theme song music video.
And somebody stole our video, put it on YouTube, and that's how we found out about it.
So thank you, piracy.
When was Smosh the most subscribed? Three separate times.
Three separate times.
We were the most subscribed.
We got passed up and then we took it back, and then we got passed up, and then we took it back, and then PewDiePie passed us, and then it was just over from there.
Sorry, I thought it was gonna be way cooler.
Okay, you know this is gonna be a good one.
Oh, no.
Who is Ian Hecox mom? Who is Ian Hecox mom? Little backstory.
One of the most popular recurring- Iconic.
Iconic OG characters from the old Smosh days was my mom who is actually played by my mom.
She's not an actor.
In fact, she hates acting.
We generally have my mom just say the worst things to me.
Call you a dumb ass.
Recently she called you an emaciated cuck.
Yeah, and it's just fun to make my mom curse.
Ian Hecox and Anthony Padilla still friends.
With no question mark or anything.
I mean, yeah.
I mean that that was a legitimate question for many years.
We were friends in the sixth grade, and then started this whole Smosh adventure together.
We did that for about 12 years.
And in that time of becoming friends, then becoming roommates, but also being business partners, it kind of put a strain on our friendship.
And for a good while after Anthony left Smosh, we actually weren't friends.
We would communicate, but there was always something that felt a little bit distant about it.
A little awkies.
A little awks.
We started reconnecting last year.
Hashed it out.
Learned how to communicate like adults rather than 17 year olds.
It's pretty dope.
Seems like things are chill.
Yeah, adult friendships are sweet.
Friendship always wins.
[hands slapping] Where is Ian Hecox from? Like Anthony, I'm from Sacramento, California, the 9-1 sickness as we call it.
Representing the 916.
Can Ian Hecox speak Spanish? What do you think that's from? Un poquito.
I mean, people gotta know if I'm bilingual, you know? It's very important.
It's because of El Smosh.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, our Spanish language dubbed channel.
They want to know if I'm the one doing the dubbing.
I'm not.
The answer is no.
Couldn't be me.
Ian Hecox Creator Clash.
No.
So Creator Clash is a charity influencer boxing match.
They get a bunch of creators and they have them box.
Like real hitting.
Yeah, they all trained for months.
They got ripped.
I attended the second one.
But you did not fight.
You know, I don't really like getting head trauma for clout.
How about this? If this video gets- Nope.
250,000 likes. Nope.
Ian will fight- I won't.
Someone.
Okay, I'll fight like a child.
Okay. Oh, okay.
Was Anthony Padilla emo? Yes? Depending on what your definition of emo is, hair wise, especially, yes.
Aura, energy wise? Yeah, I wouldn't say so.
Not so much.
I was heavily influenced by emo culture.
There you go.
What do Anthony Padilla tattoos mean? I get that question a lot.
Someone yesterday, I was at the airport, this really weird look on their face.
They're like, Those mean something? I thought about saying no, but honestly I know you're looking for an answer.
But I feel like it would take a very long time for me to get into.
They mean a lot to me.
And there's a lot of hidden messages in there that are really just for me.
I feel like I'm kind of doing this thing where I give messages to my future self, things that I never want to forget, and things that I hope to continue living with for the rest of my life.
He hid a live, laugh, love in there.
You'll never find it.
Does Anthony Padilla know what Corpse looks like? Yes, Corpse is a faceless musician.
Yes, I do know what he looks like.
I've interviewed him.
He would not want me to say this, but he looks just as cool as people draw him.
That's all I'll say.
That's all I'll say.
Who plays Anthony Padilla? So there's this guy- Mario Lopez.
Yeah, there's this guy named Mario Lopez that I hire to act out my roles sometimes.
Actually, it's funny 'cause my mom used to always say that she thought when I was younger that I was gonna grow up to look like Mario Lopez.
I mean, I see the resemblance.
What's a famous thing he says? Saved by the bell? I don't know.
Let's see if I look like him.
Saved by the bell.
Whoa.
Guys, I think it's Mario Lopez.
All right, how to get on Smosh? To be like talent on it? I don't know.
Be in LA and be funny.
And probably wait for one of the other cast members to die of old age.
So give it, I mean, I don't know.
78.
Shane's not long for this world.
So probably like five years? Smosh Beef 'n Go.
Ah.
We can't avoid talking about Beef 'n Go.
Beef 'n Go is the number one most viewed Smosh video of all time.
Which is crazy because the video's really mid, Smosh fanfic.
Oh, there's a lot out there.
I think there would be less now about us because we're not floppy haired emo boys.
So they don't really wanna see us make out as much as they used to.
And we won't talk about the milk fanfic.
You brought it up again.
Anyway.
You can't mention the milk fanfic.
We won't mention the infamous milk fanfic anymore.
Smosh Legend of Zelda rap lyrics.
So we made a Legend of Zelda rap.
Spent a lot of time writing that.
Ian played Link.
He got his elf ears, and I played the boss, Ganondorf That was our first big music video.
We had a professional cosplayer make us- The costumes by hand.
We also paid someone to make the beat, the instrumental.
And then we went out to the mountains.
We drove two hours to go film in that field.
And it was a two shoot.
Smosh.
[Both] We summoned a demon.
So this is our first sketch back and I'm so proud of it.
It was the first video that we fully wrote after deciding that we wanted to buy Smosh back.
But we didn't know if our plan to buy Smosh back and start making classic style sketches again was gonna work.
I set a date.
I was like, next weekend you're coming back over to my place and we're gonna write our first sketch, and we're gonna see if we still click.
If we still have it.
Still got the juice.
Whoa.
All right, how did Anthony Padilla and Ian Hecox meet? Aw, so that was in sixth grade.
We were doing a science project.
I didn't have any friends, so the teacher kind of assigned us to work on something together, 'cause I think everyone else had picked someone.
We were the losers.
Funny how things just don't change.
How old was Anthony Padilla when he started Smosh? Oh, okay.
I can't remember if I was 13 or 14 when I made the first Smosh website.
But I do know for a fact I was 14 years old when I made the Smosh logo.
I remember looking up what makes a good logo, doing a little fast forward sign, picking my favorite band, Linkin Park, finding their font and putting a little S in between.
Can you believe that we're still using that ass logo for like this long? We have actually honestly tried to change it.
It just doesn't hit like the OG logo.
Nothing hits like that logo.
How did Anthony Padilla and Mykie meet? That's actually very funny.
My girlfriend Mykie and I officially met for the first time on a Smosh collab.
We were promoting Smosh the Movie.
She and I did not connect at all because I had many a worry on my mind.
She actually thought I didn't like her at all.
And then four years later to the day we remet up again at Vidcon, of all places.
Yeah, I was like, what's up? What's up, girl? I'm Smosh guy.
Perfect impression, actually.
Anthony Padilla Daily Dose of Internet.
I just interviewed Daily Dose of Internet.
Many people haven't seen his face.
I think that's where most people are seeing what Daily Dose of Internet looks like.
I interviewed him on another channel not related to Smosh.
This is a show that I started doing right after I left Smosh.
The first time.
The only time, motherfucker.
Yeah, you're right.
Trying to force me out already? I haven't been here a month.
It's your first time, so far.
Ian Hecox lil toe.
Oh, okay.
It is a reference? Yeah, it is a video reference.
There's a video where I play a mumble rapper.
It was a joke on Lil Pump back when he was popping off.
I thought it was literally about your toe.
No, I thought so too.
I thought it was about my toe for a second.
I was like, is there something wrong with my toes? We don't talk about Ian's deformed lil toe.
I mean, check Wikifeet.
You'll know there.
Ian Hecox old hair.
I used to have, it wasn't an actual bowl cut, but that was the best way to describe what it was sort of.
It looked more like a loaf of bread.
Yeah, a lot of people would call me like bread head.
But people felt like a certain attachment to the bowl hair.
Do you remember when you cut your hair? And people were like, He's not funny anymore now that he cut his hair.
People used to say that Smosh stopped being funny when I cut my hair.
And a lot of people in our new videos now were like, It's not the same without Ian's bread head.
Yeah, yeah, you know what? That's fine.
Ian Hecox Madame Tussauds.
We got wax figures of the both of us.
It's me kind of pushing you out of a stool or something.
Yeah, we want it to be like a scene.
Yeah, I think it kinda toured around some Madame Tussauds, and then it was radio silence, and we didn't know where our wax figures went.
And then one day somebody sends me a photo of my wax figure alone with a VR headset on my face.
Just covering up as much of his face as possible.
And Anthony is nowhere to be seen.
I'm just like, and it's so weird.
And that's the last I've seen of it.
And I think we have to start a campaign to get our wax figures back.
They probably melted it down and then use that to build Troye Sivan's wax figure or something.
Probably.
Ian Hecox birth chart.
Well, I'm a Sagittarius.
What's your moon landing? I don't know.
My moon landing.
I don't know what the...
Yeah, I don't know.
So I'm just a Saggy.
Boom.
Who says shut up Smosh? It's me.
So shut up is an intro card thing that we do.
Almost every single video starts with some dumb soundbite and then it just says, Shut up.
The worst audio quality you could ever have.
And it's so funny 'cause people will ask me to say it.
And it never sounds the same, right? And I'm like, Bro, it's not gonna sound anything like it, 'cause it was recorded on a $10 microphone 17 years ago.
So that sound clip will outlive me.
Who works at Smosh? People. Oh, man, yeah.
Us. Us.
It's interesting to kind of go down memory lane and think about how it was literally just us in the beginning at my mom's house just messing around, making jokes for each other, trying to just make each other laugh.
And now there's multiple sound stages.
Got like 35 full-time employees.
Yeah, lots of really amazing people help make Smosh happen.
And everyone is so funny.
Who- [Both] Bought Smosh? Ooh, there's multiple.
We did.
But there was first Alloy Digital, which became Defy.
Then when that company collapsed in 2018 Rhett and Link's Mythical Entertainment purchased in 2018.
They rescued it.
They rescued it.
And we say rescued because that could have went a very different direction.
Many different companies were like, Hmm, let me get that company.
Let me buy Smosh.
Let me see what I can do to completely dismantle and destroy it.
It was gonna be ass.
Straight up, if Mythical didn't get it, I wouldn't have stayed around.
I was gonna say, you wouldn't have stayed, right? No, no.
Then we bought it back.
Who is the Smosh Pit? Yeah, the Smosh Pit was the second channel.
It was also a website for a while.
So now the Smosh Pit is this really fun unscripted channel that we have that has our other castmates on it.
We do kind of this improv show called Try Not to Laugh where you have a bunch of props and wardrobe and you try to come out and make the person on the stool laugh, spit out water.
It's all sorts of fun little unscripted shows.
Who Smosh now.
[Both] Who's Smosh now.
For the main Smosh channel, we Smosh now.
For the Smosh Pit channel, lots of cool, really funny people.
Including us.
And Smosh Games, lots of the same people also, they Smosh now.
Playing tabletop games, board games.
We just launched a D and D show.
So we're in that D and D game.
That's right, Critical Role.
We're coming for you.
We're not, we're not coming for you.
We're not really coming for you.
You're doing fine.
You have your territory.
We'll just do our thing.
We will not tread there.
We will not tread.
All right, we made it through the boards.
Yeah, let us know what you thought down below in the comments, and we will see you on a different YouTube video.
Bye.
