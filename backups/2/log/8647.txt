What you won‚Äôt think of is a large, pilotless, multi-rotor machine carrying cargo over choppy waters to a massive wind turbine.
But that‚Äôs exactly what energy firm √òrsted has started doing in the North Sea off the east coast of the U.K.
In what it claims is a world first, √òrsted is currently trialing flights of the 128-pound (58-kilogram) drones for cargo drops to wind turbines.
Are we about to see ‚Äòthe iPhone of artificial intelligence‚Äô? Wing and Walmart partner for Dallas drone delivery service Amazon starts drone delivery trials in California and Texas The company describes the drone as having ‚Äúthe equivalent weight of a large baby giraffe, with the wingspan of an albatross.‚Äù It‚Äôs operated by drone specialist Skylift and you can see it in action in the video below: üìπ Check out this giant drone gliding in the air above Hornsea 1 in the UK! We‚Äôve been testing it to explore how giant drones can be used for transporting cargo to #offshorewind turbines.

The flying machines have eight sets of rotors in a quadcopter configuration and are operated from existing crew transfer vessels and service vessels that are already on site, so extra sailings just for the drones aren‚Äôt necessary.
‚ÄúDrones mean less work disturbance as turbines don‚Äôt have to be shut down when cargo is delivered,‚Äù √òrsted said in a release. ‚ÄúThey avoid risk, making it safer for personnel working on the wind farm and minimize the need for multiple journeys by ship, reducing carbon emissions and climate change impacts.‚Äù The company has already tested smaller drones but recently moved onto larger machines capable of carrying heavier payloads.
Mikkel Haugaard Windolf, who is heading the project for √òrsted‚Äôs offshore logistics team, said he believes the U.K. could become the first country to commercialize this system in offshore wind farms.
Flying over water gives drone operators greater freedom to deploy larger machines and carry heavier objects as many restrictions still apply when it comes to drone flights over people and buildings.
Amazon , Wing , and UPS are among a number of firms looking to use drones for package delivery to customers, but strict regulations have slowed progress toward the rollout of a widely used platform.
Still, as drones advance, it‚Äôs fascinating to see how different industries are gradually turning to the technology in a bid to make their work safer and more efficient.

Drone delivery leader Wing heads to new country for next pilot program Amazon‚Äôs Scout robot appears to have made its last delivery Tech for Change Tech News The Food Fight News Google sister company Wing has been making steady progress with tests involving its delivery drone in Australia, but a recent accident highlights some of the challenges facing such pilot projects as they attempt to go mainstream.
The mishap occurred when a Wing drone on its way to deliver a food order to a customer in Logan City, Brisbane, crashed into an 11,000-volt power line. The collision caused a small fire as the drone fried on the wire before falling to the ground, leading to the disruption of electricity supplies to around 2,300 homes and businesses.
Cars Jeep will launch four electric SUVs for North America and Europe by the end of 2025, with at least two coming to the U.S., the automaker confirmed Thursday. While Jeep has some plug-in hybrids in its lineup, these will be the brand's first all-electric models.
The first of these models to launch will be the Jeep Recon, which is scheduled to start production in 2024, with reservations opening in early 2023. While it won't be fully revealed until next year, Jeep confirmed the Recon will have a "one-touch power top, removable doors, and glass," similar to the current Jeep Wrangler. While it doesn't replace the Wrangler, it's definitely inspired by the iconic off-roader, Jim Morrison, head of the Jeep brand in North America, said during a presentation of the electrification plan.
Computing We have been patiently waiting for Apple to drop its much-anticipated virtual reality headset, and now it seems we're closer than ever. Apple filed some trademark names for its upcoming AR/VR headset, indicating it's one step closer to launch.
The trademarks were filed simultaneously in the U.S., U.K., Europe, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Saudi Arabia, Costa Rica, and Uruguay. The trademarks protect the names "Reality One," "Reality Pro," and "Reality Processor." Apple used the same law firms it has used in the past in these countries to file the trademarks.
