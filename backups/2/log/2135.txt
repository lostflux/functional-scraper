Why trust us? Why it’s still a good time to buy an M2 MacBook Air By Luke Larsen Close Luke Larsen / Digital Trends If you’re shopping for a new MacBook, timing is important when trying to get the most for your money. It’s especially important since we know the next MacBook Air is currently in the works, and it’s said to come with the anticipated M3 chip.
Considering it’s been over a year since the 13-inch M2 MacBook Air made its debut, you might assume the update is coming. If you’re in the market for a MacBook Air, I would normally advise you to wait until the M3 model comes out. But according to the latest reports, the M3 MacBook Air may be further away than we originally assumed.
Insider Mark Gurman notes in his newsletter that the M3 chip may still get announced later this year — but it will launch initially on just the 13-inch MacBook Pro and Mac mini. Unlike in previous years, Apple may be holding back the MacBook Air for a later update.
Waiting would allow Apple to give the 13-inch MacBook Pro more of the spotlight, as it has been a tough sell in the past due to the outdated chassis. It still has a Touch Bar, large bezels, and lower-resolution webcam. Even with all the chip upgrades, it’s remained the worst Mac you can buy — especially compared to the MacBook Air.
 And yet, Apple seems to be determined to keep it in the lineup with a bump to the M3 before the year’s end. A delay in the M3 MacBook Air could also allow Apple to update both the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air at the same time since the 15-inch model was introduced just this past summer.
Luke Larsen / Digital Trends Regardless of the reason, it looks as if the M3 MacBook Air update won’t be coming until 2024. It could be closer to six months out, especially if Apple waits until its customary annual spring event.
So, if you’re in the market for a new MacBook, you can feel fairly safe still buying the M2 MacBook Air, whether it’s the 13-inch or the 15-inch model. Even if Apple were to opt for an earlier release, the change to the M3 in these laptops won’t be a deal breaker. The M2 MacBook Air is already a fantastic laptop, masterfully balancing both portability and performance. The M3 will certainly provide an uplift in performance (and possibly battery life), but if you were already considering the MacBook Air, your needs probably aren’t suited for one of Apple’s more powerful laptops anyways.
Heck, if you really don’t need all the bells and whistles of the newer MacBook Air, Apple still sells the original M1 MacBook Air too. Serving as the entry point to the lineup at just $999 (and often sold for as low as $799), the M1 MacBook Air uses an older chassis, but still delivers some impressive performance and battery life. Although the M2 MacBook Air is the better-looking laptop, the M1 MacBook Air will surprise you with how well it holds up.
I might have different advice for someone considering an M2 Pro or M2 Max MacBook Pros though. If performance is paramount, the bump to the M3 may have a huge difference in your workload, so waiting for this upcoming generation might be a good idea. These new laptops are also said to be coming in the spring of 2024, so they’re not too far off.
Editors' Recommendations A major era in MacBook history is finally over Here’s more proof that Apple is wrong about MacBook memory MacBook Pro M3: Should you choose the M3, M3 Pro, or M3 Max? Apple’s M3 Max appears to keep up with Intel’s top desktop CPU Why Apple’s subtle MacBook Pro decision makes me so happy Apple Laptops Mac Tech News Computing Apple just did something surprising. At its "Scary Fast" launch event, Apple announced a new chip, the M3.
But rather than introduce it in a MacBook Air like it did with the M1 and M2, this event was all about the MacBook Pro. The MacBook Air was inconspicuously missing.
Computing Macs with Apple silicon were a revelation when they launched three years ago, but we haven't seen Apple demonstrate how it will carry that idea forward since then. We saw the M2 release and the middling performance improvements that came with it, but the M3, announced during Apple's "Scary Fast" event, is the most important chip Apple has ever designed for Macs.
Although it carries the branding of the third generation of Apple silicon, it's really the second true generation. There's a lot riding on this release for Apple to prove that it can sustain its own silicon in Macs, and M3 is arriving at a time when there's fierce competition on all sides.
Second-gen Apple silicon Computing It's not often that MacBook Pros get new color options. But with this most recent update to M3 chips, the MacBook Pro will add Space Black, a color that first appeared on the iPhone, to the mix. I was shown an early preview of the new color ahead of the "Scary Fast" launch event, and I have to say: I'm smitten.
This new Space Black is not true black, of course. In truth, it's a slightly darker gray than Space Gray, which it replaces. And it's a good thing this isn't true black. Because remember, this is aluminum, and Apple isn't just slapping a coating or layer of paint on here like so many laptop manufacturers do when making true black aluminum laptops. These laptops, such as most gaming laptops or even something like the Surface Laptop, tend to scratch easily and fade over time.
