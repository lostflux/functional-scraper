Why trust us? What’s new on Disney+ in November 2023 By Blair Marnell Close Get ready for Christmas in November. You will see this on all of the streaming services in November, but especially on Disney+.
 This month, Tim Allen’s The Santa Clauses is back for its second season, but sci-fi fans may be more excited by the Disney+ premiere of Doctor Who.
 T he Star Beast is the first of three Doctor Who 60th anniversary specials featuring David Tennant as the Doctor and Catherine Tate as his former companion, Donna Noble. The other two specials will premiere on Disney+ in December, before the traditional Doctor Who Christmas special officially introduces Ncuti Gatwa as the next Doctor.
Marvel Studios’ Loki season 2 will come to a close this month, as will the initial season of the Goosebumps revival series. Additionally, Spider-Man: Far From Home is making its Disney+ debut in November, which leaves Spider-Man: No Way Home as the only live-action Spidey film with Tom Holland that isn’t on Marvel’s official streaming home.
No Way Home is also the only MCU film that’s currently absent from Disney+. Perhaps that will change at some point in 2024.

The pace at which the streamer adds original content may be inconsistent, but legacy additions help maintain its mainstream appeal. That's in large part thanks to reliable brands like Star Wars, Marvel, and National Geographic being constant contributors to the catalog. Having a diverse library is an important asset to help a streamer to stand apart in a packed market, and this monthly guide will help you sift through the Disney+ movie selection for the best titles to stream right now.
If you're not already fully invested, the Disney Bundle is also worth your money. With this package, customers gain access to Disney+, ESPN+, and Hulu's ad-supported plan for just $13 a month. Given the diversity of content on offer from these platforms, that's a respectable value.
Audio / Video It's finally happening. After months of rumors, followed by an actual announcement, a combined app with content from Disney+ and Hulu will launch in beta status in December 2023, ahead of an official launch in the spring.
And, well, that's really all we have at the moment. Disney CEO Bob Iger dropped the news on the company's fiscal fourth-quarter earnings call on November 8. (The company ends its fiscal year on September 30.) Entertainment Among the upcoming Marvel Studios original series, Echo has been one of the question marks because its leading character, Maya Lopez, is not a headlining heroine in Marvel's comics. However, the first trailer for Echo has been released by Disney+ and Hulu (which will both stream the series), and the first footage goes a long way towards winning us over by heavily leaning into the show's TV-MA rating. Especially when Maya's former guardian, Wilson Fisk (Vincent D'Onofrio), brutally beats a man as Maya looks on.
