The pilot program is part of The EV Project , which is seeking to develop an infrastructure for supporting electric-only vehicles. The projects at Best Buy will analyze how EV customers use the charging stations and develop best practices for creating future EV infrastructure in a variety of locations.

Best Buy has shown true leadership as becoming a launch partner for The EV Project and exemplifies how corporate responsibility initiatives can directly benefit the customer experience, environment and society.” The EV charging stations will roll out at Best Buy locations in Tuscon, Phoenix, Los Angeles, San Diego, and Seattle. The locations will take into account things like distance from other existing charging stations, proximity to interstates and other major routes, and population density. Electric cars might have their advantages, but one of them is not usually range: for instance, the Nissan Leaf can operate for about 80 to 100 miles between charges, meaning most residential users can’t go much further than 40 or 50 miles from home…unless they know where they can hook up to a charging station along the way. Nissan believes most people will want to charge their electric cars at home overnight, since a complete charge takes several hours, but Blink says its commercial chargers will be able to deliver a “meaningful” charge in as little as 15 minutes.
Flash deal knocks $140 off this 48-amp home electric vehicle charger One of the best values in electric SUVs comes from the last brand you’d expect Big EVs are almost here: 7 upcoming electric SUVs we’re excited for The commercial Blink Network EV chargers feature color touch screens and connect to a Web-based portal that shows a vehicles’s charge status, history, stats, and billing information, along with a bunch of payment options.
The EV Project, managed by Ecotality, hopes to install some 15,000 commercial and residential charging stations in 16 cities across six states.

Of course, there are a lot of dash cams to pick from with various levels of quality and features. Luckily, one of the better dash cams is on sale right now, the Nextbase 4k Dash Cam, and while it usually goes for $400, you can grab it from Best Buy for just $350. While that may not seem like much, $350 for a 4k-capable dash cam is impressive.
Why you should buy the Nextbase 622GW 4K Dash Cam The Nexbase 622GW is packed with some impressive features, such as the 4k resolution, which films at 30fps, although it can film at 60fps at 2k and, interestingly, 120fps at 1080p, although we doubt you'll very much run the last mode regularly. More importantly, it comes with some advanced image stabilization to help deal with the vibrations and bumps from your car, plus it comes with some next-level night vision and image polarization to help with sunny conditions that might otherwise cause glare. Even better, it has internal processing capable of helping with misty conditions, making this a great camera for all-weather driving, which is impressive for such a small package.
Cars When you brought home your shiny new electric vehicle, it came with a home charging cord. But that was likely a Level 1 charger, which can only add two or three miles of range per hour. Upgrading to a Level 2 home EV charger can triple that speed — or more — plus provide you with a multitude of options to help lower your electricity bill and extend your car battery life.
In other words, it's now easy to keep your car topped up without ever having to drive to a DC fast charging station unless you're on a road-trip -- ensuring that in day-to-day use, your car will stay fully charged.
Cars If you’re looking to add some modern software to your vehicle, one great way to do so is with a new digital media receiver. Pioneer is one of the premier name brands when it comes to car audio, and right now Best Buy has deals taking place on a variety of Pioneer digital receivers, each of which can upgrade your car’s dashboard and your own mobile digital experience. Discounts reach as high as $150, and sale prices are as low as $160. Several models also include free installation.
If your vehicle was made before features like Apple CarPlay or Android Auto became standard on a new vehicle, you may be thinking you need to purchase a brand new car to gain access to such software. All you really need to do, however, is upgrade your car stereo, and it will cost you a lot less than coming up with a down payment on a new car. With these discounts currently taking place at Best Buy, you can get a Pioneer digital media receiver for Upgrade your lifestyle Digital Trends helps readers keep tabs on the fast-paced world of tech with all the latest news, fun product reviews, insightful editorials, and one-of-a-kind sneak peeks.
