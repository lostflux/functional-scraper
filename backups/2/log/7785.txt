Why trust us? The best sci-fi movies on Hulu right now By Michileen Martin and Blair Marnell Close The future is now … it’s just not as exciting as every sci-fi film made it out to be. On the plus side, we don’t have aliens constantly invading the Earth. But we also lack the high-tech paradise and enlightened humanity of Star Trek. All we have are compelling science fiction stories, some of which have a lot to say about our daily lives in the present.
Hulu has a grand assortment of both the high-minded sci-fi and the general fare action flicks that fill up movie theaters. And we’ve already narrowed down this vast selection to the best sci-fi movies on Hulu right now.
Another thing to keep in mind is that Hulu is part of the Disney Bundle.
 That includes the basic Hulu subscription (with ads), Disney+, and ESPN+, all for just $14 a month. That’s a great deal, and you don’t even have to go to the future for it.
If you’re curious about what’s available in science fiction on other streaming services, we also have guides for the best sci-fi movies on Netflix , as well as the best sci-fi movies on Amazon Prime Video.
