Now, it‚Äôs creating its own handheld video game system, the Razer Edge 5G.
Razer partnered with Verizon and Qualcomm to announce its new mobile gaming handheld at Mobile World Congress Las Vegas on Wednesday, calling it the world‚Äôs first 5G mobile gaming handheld. It‚Äôs designed to allow people to play their favorite games whether they‚Äôre apps downloaded to play locally, streamed from their console of choice, or accessed directly from the cloud.
BREAKING: @Verizon , @Razer and @Qualcomm are teaming up on the world&#39;s first 5G mobile gaming handheld‚ÄîRazer Edge 5G ! It will allow you to play your favorite games regardless of whether you are gaming in the cloud, on an app or streaming from your console.
https://t.co/TYPw5xFyeF pic.twitter.com/F9Vg3CfABl &mdash; George Koroneos üóøüçπ (@GLKCreative) September 28, 2022 T-Mobile still has the fastest 5G, but its rivals are catching up The 5G speed race is over and T-Mobile has won T-Mobile‚Äôs 5G is still unmatched ‚Äî but have speeds plateaued? The Razer Edge 5G was originally created by Qualcomm as a developer-only concept system last year called the Snapdragon G3x.
 In other words, the company only sent out a dev kit for the system for any game developer who wanted to give it a test run instead of selling it on the market. Now the 5G-enabled gaming handheld is built upon the same system, but with a few changes in its design if you paid close attention to the details in the teaser.
Most notably, the controller layout has added an extra button next to the triggers, seemingly bringing it more in line with the recently released Razer Kishi V2.
The announcement of the Razer Edge 5G comes nearly two months after the Logitech G Gaming Handheld was revealed by Tencent and Logitech. Digital Trends previewed the system last week, with writer Tomas Franzese noting that the device felt niche considering that people can stream cloud games on their phones already. The Razer Edge 5G could fall into that same category, but Verizon does emphasize that some games can be downloaded on the device and played locally.
The Razer Edge 5G will be officially unveiled at RazerCon on October 15.
Editors' Recommendations Have an Android phone? You can get unlimited 5G service for free T-Mobile‚Äôs huge lead in 5G speeds isn‚Äôt going anywhere Live in a rural area? Verizon 5G is about to get better for you Here‚Äôs how fast 5G on your Samsung Galaxy S23 really is What is 5G UW? The real meaning behind the icon on your phone Mobile 5G Cellular Carriers Cloud Gaming PC Gaming Qualcomm Tech News Verizon Mobile Qualcomm has just announced the Snapdragon X75, the company's sixth-generation 5G modem that promises to push smartphones and other connected devices into the next phase of 5G technology.
The Snapdragon X75 is the successor to last year's X70, which is the modem found in the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 that powers this year's most powerful 5G smartphones ‚Äî including Samsung's recently unveiled Galaxy S23 Ultra and the OnePlus 11. However, it's more than just an evolution of that earlier modem system, as Qualcomm has packed in support for next-generation 5G Advanced technology along with an entirely new architecture and powerful AI features that will allow mobile devices to access better coverage and achieve even faster speeds.
5G grows up big-time Mobile Qualcomm is poised to deliver 5G capabilities to a whole new class of mobile devices with a new modem chip that bridges the gap between today's best smartphones and much lower-bandwidth devices like payment terminals and home accessories.
Announced today, Qualcomm's Snapdragon X35 5G Modem-RF system is the world's first to adopt NR-Light, a new 5G standard for midtier devices that don't require the power and performance of a 5G-capable smartphone or tablet ‚Äî but can still take advantage of the lower latency and power consumption offered by 5G technology.
Filling the 5G void Mobile T-Mobile continues to command a massive lead in offering the best 5G experience among U.S. carriers. A few weeks ago, a report from Ookla revealed that T-Mobile is leaving its rivals in the dust; now Opensignal has confirmed that not only is the Un-carrier‚Äôs lead increasing in raw speeds, but it‚Äôs leading the way in taking 5G into the mainstream.
According to Opensignal‚Äôs latest 5G Experience Report, T-Mobile not only offers the fastest 5G experience in the U.S. by a sizeable margin but on average, customers on T-Mobile spend nearly 50% of their time on the carrier‚Äôs 5G network.
