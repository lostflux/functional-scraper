Other maneuvers such as zero turns, pivot turns, and diagonal driving are also possible.
Hyundai has been working on the technology for at least five years, and previously showed it off in purpose-built vehicles that aren’t on the market.
But at CES last week, the Korean automaker revealed an Ioniq 5 EV incorporating the e-Corner technology, and judging by the footage in the video below, it looks pretty darn impressive.
The most striking of the maneuvers is the Crab Driving mode designed to let a vehicle enter and exit tight parallel parking spaces with ease — though you’d have to make sure the vehicles front and back have enough space to get out or you could meet one (or possiby two!) rather irate owner when you return to your vehicle.
I’m glad the Hyundai Ioniq 6 isn’t just a smaller Ioniq 5 Additional driving range makes the Hyundai Ioniq Electric a more competitive EV It’s not clear how useful the other modes would be, but if you live in a city with narrow streets, or drive routes that are often congested, it’s possible they could come in handy to free you from tricky situations from time to time.
Wondering when you’ll be able to actually buy a Hyundai vehicle with this technology fitted? Well, seeing it in the Ioniq 5 EV suggests the automaker is making good progress with the system, but it appears it’ll be at least a couple more years before it hits the market, according comments made by Hyundai in 2021.
Some other automakers are also making headway with similar technology.
General Motors’ Hummer EV , for example, has a Crab Walk mode that partially swivels the rear wheels, enabling it to shift across a surface diagonally rather than sideways.

The move follows in the footsteps of more than a dozen other automakers that have also adopted Tesla’s charging connector, among them General Motors, Ford, Toyota, BMW, Jaguar Land Rover, Volvo, and Honda.
Cars General Motors-owned Cruise has halted production of its fully driverless vehicle -- the Origin -- just over a week after it suspended robotaxi operations nationwide following a number of troubling incidents involving its cars.
The news was announced by Cruise CEO Kyle Vogt during a meeting with staff on Monday, according to Forbes, which obtained audio of the gathering.
Cars The Ram brand is finally taking an electrified approach, and by resurrecting the Ramcharger name, no less. Alongside the new 2025 Ram 1500, the company has unveiled the new 2025 Ram 1500 Ramcharger, a new plug-in hybrid that Ram touts as offering "unlimited battery electric range." The new truck is one of a number of electrified trucks, the most well-known of which include the fully-electric Ford F-150 Lightning and the new Chevrolet Silverado EV. But instead of being fully electric, the 1500 Ramcharger is a plug-in hybrid, meaning that it has an electric motor and battery, and a gas tank and engine.
The plug-in approach It's perhaps a smart move. Electric trucks show a lot of promise -- but they start to falter a little when it comes to things like towing and hauling heavy loads. Keeping the 1500 Ramcharger a hybrid means that with no load or light ones, the truck can zip around town on electric power -- and when necessary, it can switch the engine on to tow or haul. It could well be the perfect combo for many truck owners who at least occasionally need that extra oomph, but who still could stand to save some cash -- and go a little easier on the environment - when simply driving around town.
