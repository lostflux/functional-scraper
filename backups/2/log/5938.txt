The best gaming headsets do more than your TV’s speakers or most soundbars can, highlighting the bullets whizzing past you in Call of Duty: Warzone , the rev of an engine Forza Horizon 4, or the subtle screech of sneakers in NBA 2K21.
The best gaming headset: SteelSeries Arctis Pro The best premium wired headset: HyperX Cloud Revolver S The best premium wireless headset: Astro Gaming A50 The best wireless surround sound headset: Logitech G533 The best budget option for any platform: Turtle Beach Recon 200 The best gaming headset for PlayStation: Pulse 3D Wireless Headset The best gaming headset for Xbox: Xbox Wireless Headset The best gaming headset for PC: Razer Blackshark V2 It doesn’t matter if you’re playing on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC, or Switch — or even if you’ve upgraded to a PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X.
 We have a collection of premium gaming headsets that deliver exceptional sound quality. Our top pick, though, is the SteelSeries Arctis Pro thanks to its excellent audio quality and comfortable, modern design.
Gaming headsets are expensive ventures, but this list can help you see which one is worth the price, no matter where or how you play. If you’re shopping for a specific system, we’ve also found the best PS4 and Xbox One headsets , as well as the best gaming headset deals.
Best gaming headset deals: Turtle Beach, Razer, JBL and more The best PS4 games for 2023 The best indie games on Nintendo Switch The best gaming headsets at a glance The best gaming headset: SteelSeries Arctis ProFall The best premium wired headset: HyperX Cloud Revolver S The best premium wireless headset: Astro Gaming A50 The best wireless surround sound headset: Logitech G533 The best budget option for any platform: Turtle Beach Recon 200 The best gaming headset for PlayStation: Pulse 3D Wireless Headset The best gaming headset for Xbox: Xbox Wireless Headset The best gaming headset for PC: Razer Blackshark V2 The best gaming headset: SteelSeries Arctis Pro Image used with permission by copyright holder Why you should buy this: It’s the best-in-class gaming headset by virtually every factor.
Who it’s for: Those who demand performance, deep customization, versatility, and understated design.
Why we picked the Steelseries Arctis Pro : Where do we start with Steelseries ‘ magnum opus, the Arctis Pro? The highly flexible, crystal-clear mic that rivals even some professional-grade audio equipment? How about the sleek, professional design that mimics stylish audiophile headphones? Or maybe it’s the headset’s plug-and-play peripherals that push hi-res sound and enable users to fine-tune EQ settings and surround sound at a much more granular scale than the competition — all without the need for extra software or downloads.
Take your pick.
While the optional hi-res components (either the GameDAC with the wired version or the 2.4G Bluetooth receiver box) are only compatible with PC and PS4, the Arctis Pro is compatible with virtually every console right out of the box, either through wireless USB or 3.5mm wired connection. All players, regardless of platform, can take advantage of the headset’s excellent stereo mix and super-clear microphone — not to mention the fact that its mature design is customizable to fit your taste.
While it’s hard to top the Arctis Pro, even Steelseries’ more affordable Arctis models, including the Arctis 3, 5, and 7 , are impressive alternatives, identical to the Pro in terms of comfort and only a modest step down in performance and features (the Arctis 7 was our previous top pick, in fact). There are wired and wireless versions of each of these headsets, and while they require the Steelseries Engine 3 software to use the surround sound and EQ features (meaning these features are PC-only), they still sound great even without these extras. So, should the Arctis Pro reside outside your budget, any of these Arctis models could compete for the top spot on our list.
Read our full Arctis Pro review The best premium wired headset: HyperX Cloud Revolver S Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Why you should buy this: The excellent-sounding Cloud Revolver S is the most versatile and easy-to-use headset we’ve tested.
Who it’s for: Anyone and everyone, provided a wired connection works with your setup.
Why we picked the Cloud Revolver S : The Cloud Revolver S from HyperX is one of the most versatile headsets we’ve tested. It comes packed with three separate connection types — 3.5mm, dual 3.5mm, and wired USB — which, in aggregate, enable the headset to be connected to just about anything. This isn’t entirely unique to the Cloud Revolver S, but the headset takes things a step further by eliminating the need for any extra software or driver downloads, making it a truly plug-and-play peripheral. This integrated nature is especially important with the USB connection, which features a built-in sound card and a control dongle for features like Dolby 7.1 virtual surround sound and EQ settings.
The most important feature, however, is the brilliant sound performance. The basic, out-of-the-box stereo mix, which is the baseline regardless of connection type or console, is excellent, with a snug balance and punchy bass that enhances gameplay and music. The surround sound and EQ features — specifically the bass boost — only serve to further enhance the experience. The cherry on top is that the Cloud Revolver S is extremely comfortable, with a sturdy design, plush padding, and an auto-fitting headband. Sounds like a winner to us.
Read our full Cloud Revolver S review The best premium wireless headset: Astro Gaming A50 Image used with permission by copyright holder Why you should buy this: It’s the Swiss Army Knife of wireless headsets.
Who it’s for: Gamers who want a wireless headset stuffed with features (and don’t mind paying extra for them).
Why we picked the Astro Gaming A50 : Astro’s A50 is the wireless update of the company’s previous flagship, the Astro A40, and sports all the same hallmarks as its last-gen brethren — but we’re not complaining. If you can justify the dent to your savings account, the Astro A50 will grant you 5.8GHz wireless technology and virtual 7.1 surround sound within a solid, over-the-ear design. The headset’s unidirectional mic helps isolate your voice from ambient noise and features an intuitive quick-mute feature. A selection of distinct EQ modes and cross-platform support further boost its appeal.
The A50 does just about everything you’d want from a high-quality gaming headset, including extras like hassle-free wireless connection, long battery life bolstered by an auto-shutdown feature that prevents wasting battery.
Those extra features are great, but they’re only part of the story. The real star here is the audio performance, and the A50 is one of the best, making games more engrossing and entertaining. The Astro Gaming A50s are worth serious consideration by all audiophile gamers, provided you’re willing and able to shell out the cash.
Read our full Astro Gaming A50 review The best wireless surround sound headset: Logitech G533 Image used with permission by copyright holder Why you should buy this: It’s got the best surround sound of any headset we’ve tested yet.
Who it’s for: Those who need pinpoint soundstage location and precision.
Why we picked the Logitech G533 : Logitech’s latest headset, the Logitech G533 , brings several impressive features to a solid, attractive design, most notably the DTS 7.1 surround built into the speaker. This wireless headset comes standard with some simple-to-use software that can control the equalizer settings and enable the surround sound. It just so happens to have the best surround sound staging we’ve used in a headset, bar none. Whether you’re playing a first-person or third-person perspective game, sounds emit within the headphones from the proper location, making navigating these virtual worlds easier. The headset also performs well with 2D games. Regardless of what kind of games you play, however, the G553 sounds excellent thanks to its 40mm Pro-G drivers (we did notice some minor wireless hum when nothing was being played through the headphones but that was absent during gameplay).
The mic is equally good. We found voice capture with the mic to be clear, and we dig the minimalist design of the boom mic, which can be easily flipped up when not in use, or extended and bent for finding the optimal distance. As is often the case with Logitech gear, the headset has several neat idiosyncrasies, like a textured pad on the USB receiver for extra grip and internal “beeps” to inform you of volume changes, low battery levels, or mic enabling. It’s also, thankfully, devoid of any gaudy lights or “cool” decals, opting instead for a simpler and therefore more attractive aesthetic than most other headsets out there. While not necessarily groundbreaking, these are nice touches nonetheless.
One decision we’re admittedly a bit less enthusiastic about is the fabric used on the earcup padding, which we found scratchy and stiff during initial use. Then again, the padding is removable and washer safe, which isn’t something we can say about most of the other headsets on this list. Logitech’s G533 delivers solid surround sound quality at a reasonable price.
Read our full Logitech G533 review The best budget option for any platform: Turtle Beach Recon 200 Image used with permission by copyright holder Why you should buy this: The Turtle Beach Recon 200 is compatible with everything from the PS4 to the Switch, has excellent audio options, and built-in microphone monitoring.
Who it’s for: The budget-minded gamer.
Why we picked the Turtle Beach Recon 200: Looking for the best cheap gaming headset ? Turtle Beach has been making a name for itself over the last several years, and it’s no surprise when you look at what the company can deliver at such affordable prices. The Recon 200 wired headset comes with a 3.5mm jack so that it can be used with everything from the Xbox One to the PlayStation 4 and even your phone. The always-active Bass Boost feature gives you a more powerful experience during intense gaming moments, and 12 hours of battery life means you can take advantage of these features during your longest gaming marathon sessions without having to plug it in to recharge.
To go from the Xbox One to PlayStation 4, all you need to do is flip a switch on the headset, and the Recon 200 makes a great chatting headset, as well. The omnidirectional microphone has variable monitoring so you can hear what you sound like as you’re talking, and flipping it into its vertical position will automatically mute the microphone. With a metal-reinforced headband and foam-cushioned ear cups, the headset is built to last, too, and its wide compatibility means that it can be your sole headset if you dislike switching back and forth between several when you use different systems. The only downside to this construction is that it can cause some discomfort on top of your head, but it can be adjusted to mitigate this.
The Turtle Beach Recon 200 headset may not have the bells and whistles of more expensive headsets, but it doesn’t need them. With solid audio quality, a sturdy build, and compatibility with nearly every platform, the Recon 200 is much more impressive than its price would suggest.
The best gaming headset for PlayStation: Pulse 3D Wireless Headset Image used with permission by copyright holder Why you should buy this: The Pulse 3D Audio Headset shows off the PS5’s Tempest 3D AudioTech engine, and it looks great. That said, it’s best for players who mostly play on PS5.
Who it’s for: PlayStation fans who primarily play on a PS5.
Why we picked the Pulse 3D Audio Headset : The Pulse 3D Wireless Headset is built for PS5. It’s tuned for the console’s Tempest 3D AudioTech engine, which is a virtual surround sound technology that developers can take advantage of on the PS5. The Pulse 3D headset isn’t the only one that supports Tempest; the PS5 supports the tech on most headsets that are compatible with the console. This headset is tuned specifically for the 3D audio, though, so it’s the best showcase of the PS5’s new audio features.
You can connect the Pulse 3D headset to your PS5 or PS4 using the included wireless adaptor or through a 3.5mm jack. With the 3.5mm port, you can use the Pulse 3D on any device with a headphone jack. The wireless adaptor is also compatible with Windows and MacOS. Unfortunately, the headset doesn’t support Bluetooth.
Additionally, the headset comes with dual noise-cancelling microphones hidden away in the ear cups, USB-C for charging, and 12 hours of battery life. The Pulse 3D Wireless Headset is almost perfect, but the lack of Bluetooth holds it back from being our top recommendation. If first-party accessories don’t do it for you, make sure to check out our roundup of the best PS5 headsets.
The best gaming headset for Xbox: Xbox Wireless Headset Image used with permission by copyright holder Why you should buy this: Multiple connectively options and understated branding make the Xbox Wireless Headset a great option for gaming and everyday use.
Who it’s for: Xbox fans that want to use their headphones for more than gaming.
Why we picked the Xbox Wireless Headset: It took Microsoft awhile after the launch of the Xbox Series X , but the official Xbox Wireless Headset is now on the market. And it’s a good one. Of course, it’s built for Xbox consoles, and it pairs directly to your console without a dongle. It also works on PC and mobile devices via Bluetooth, though it lacks a 3.5mm jack.
Although the Xbox Wireless Headset lacks the 3D audio features on the PS5, you can still use the Dolby Atmos and DTS Headphone:X virtual surround codecs on Xbox and PC. The Xbox Accessories Apps opens up a slew of options for the headset, too, including an equalizer, auto-mute settings, mic monitoring, and a bass boost.
We usually prefer a wired option, but with 15 hours of battery life and an additional four hours with a 30-minute charge, the Xbox Wireless Headset should last you all day. Plus, it supports Bluetooth, so you can use the headset outside of gaming. If you want a few third-party options, make sure to read our guide to the best Xbox Series X headsets.
The best gaming headset for PC: Razer Blackshark V2 Image used with permission by copyright holder Why you should buy this: The Razer Blackshark V2 sounds much better than its price suggests, and it remains comfortable even after the longest gaming sessions.
Who it’s for: Gamers who don’t mind looking like a sportscaster.
Why we picked the Razer Blackshark V2 : The Razer Blackshark V2 is a functional headset that doesn’t mind looking that way. It’s built for performance with a wired connection, noise-isolating ear cups, and a long, detachable microphone. It ditches features like Bluetooth in favor of uncompromising sound and microphone quality. The Triforce titanium drivers separate the highs, mids, and lows to provide as much detail as possible across the frequency spectrum, and they support THX Game Profiles, providing virtual surround sound tuned to the game you’re playing.
For the microphone, the Blackshark V2 headset comes with a USB sound card. Combined with Razer Synapse, you can boost the mic’s output, tweak the voice gate, and set up ambient noise reduction. The Blackshark V2 headset sounds great, but it also allows you to sound great.
Outside of audio quality, the Blackshark V2 headset is one of the most comfortable on this list. It weighs only 262 grams, and the ear cushions are soft enough to stay comfortable for hours while still blocking a lot of ambient noise. The headset works best on PC with Razer Synapse, but you can also use it on any device with a 3.5mm jack.
How we test Like we do for all the products we test, we put gaming headsets through the wringer. We judge them based upon their audio performance, mic performance, wearability, battery life, and wireless connectivity. We play games featuring various sound experiences to ensure the headsets will sound great during frenetic action, as well as quieter moments. We also listen to non-gaming audio and videos, including a selection of music from various genres at differing bit rates to discern whether the headsets perform well outside of a gaming context.
For mic testing, we record clips of ourselves speaking in quiet and loud environments, both with any noise canceling or enhancements toggled on and off. We use the headsets over multiple days, wearing them while gaming, watching videos, or listening to music to test the veracity of battery life claims, as well as appraise their long-term wearability and comfort.
This list features both wired and wireless headsets in multiple varieties, which begs the question: Which design style is best? The answer quite simply comes down to your setup. The following is a handy guide to decide which headset will be best for you.
Platform The first major consideration is what gaming platform(s) you’ll be using with the headset, as the supported connection will differ from console to console. Modern headsets will connect via one (or more) of the following ways: Single 3.5mm, dual 3.5mm (one for headphone audio and one for the mic), wired USB, wireless USB, or Bluetooth. Here’s a quick breakdown of which connection type is supported by each of the modern gaming platforms: Platform USB 3.5mm Bluetooth Dual 3.5mm PC X X X X PlayStation 5* X X Xbox Series X|S X X PlayStation 4* X X X Xbox One** X Nintendo Switch*** X X X Wii U X Nintendo 3DS X PlayStation Vita X X Smartphones X X Tablets X X * While most USB headsets can be used on PS4 and PS5, many are specifically made for PC and will require drivers or extra software to enable features like surround sound, EQ settings, and even mic support in some instances. Because of this, some USB headsets will have limited functionality on PS4 and PS5. For those wanting a USB headset on PS4 or PS5, seek out headsets that list PS4 compatibility explicitly , such as the Cloud Revolver S.
**Only certain wireless USB models are supported by Xbox One, such as the Turtle Beach Elite 800X. Be sure to confirm compatibility before purchasing. For 3.5mm headsets, newer Xbox One controllers have a headphone jack, while older versions may require Microsoft’s official 3.5mm headset adapter.
***Voice chat on the Nintendo Switch is handled through your smartphone’s mic via Nintendo’s smartphone app. The system’s 3.5mm jack, Bluetooth, and USB adapter connections only support audio out. Bluetooth also requires an external adapter.
Wired vs. wireless Both wired and wireless headsets have their pros and cons, and there are specific uses that could make one or the other the right fit for your setup.
While wireless headsets are obviously more flexible when it comes to your connection to the source device, a major constraint for USB or Bluetooth wireless headsets is compatibility, as the table above shows. You’ll only be able to use USB wireless models with PS4, PC, and, in some select cases, Xbox One or Nintendo Switch. Bluetooth headsets are compatible with PC, PS4, PS Vita, mobile devices, and, conditionally, the Nintendo Switch.
Wireless headsets are best for large living room setups where you’re on one side and your console or PC is on the other.
That said, you’re going to get a lot more distance and freedom from a wireless headset, which makes them best for large living room setups where you’re going to be sitting on one side of the room and your console or PC is at the other. Keep an eye out for battery life rating, as well. Most headsets can survive for at least a few straight hours of play, but there’s nothing worse than having to stop in the middle of an intense match to plug in your headset’s charging cable once the batteries are tapped.
Wired headsets, on the other hand, have more reliable sound quality and are more likely to have features like virtual surround sound (though this feature is pretty common on newer and more expensive wireless options). While constrained by wires, they’re free of the fetters of battery life.
They obviously work best for those who are going to be sitting right next to their PC or console, though many devices, including the Nintendo Switch system — as well as the controllers for Xbox One, PS4, and Wii U — all feature 3.5mm jacks, making distance less of an issue since these devices will be in your hands. Keep in mind the length of the connection cable if you’re connecting via 3.5mm to a PC, TV/monitor, or a sound system. In some cases, extensions or swapping for a new cable might be necessary to get the distance your setup requires.
Headphones and free-standing mic The all-in-one nature of a gaming headset is a convenience, but a convenience that comes with trade-offs. Audio quality will be impressive on the highest-end headsets — as will the mic performance — but these are generally not made with extreme audiophiles or audio recording professionals in mind.
YouTubers, Twitch streamers, podcasters, and anyone else who requires the best possible audio quality may want to skip a headset altogether. Instead, we recommend pairing top-tier headphones with a free-standing mic (and, if you’re really after the best quality, a USB mixer). A setup like this is going to be exclusive to those using a PC — or at the very least those who do their editing and voice capture there — and is going to be a lot more expensive.

Gaming There’s nothing that can enhance your gaming experience quite like a good headset. In addition to bringing the game right to your ears, a good headset will offer spatial audio — allowing you to pinpoint sounds around you — a solid microphone, and excellent comfort, especially for long gaming sessions. Our five best Xbox Series X headsets satisfy all three and more.
Gaming Asymmetrical multiplayer games have come into their own over the past few years, with titles like Among Us, Dead by Daylight, and Back 4 Blood pulling in legions of players. Instead of giving two teams a similar set of abilities, asymmetrical games are purposefully lopsided -- one team might be larger but have less firepower, while the other team might be comprised of a single, powerful player.
It’s a unique concept and one that’s seen plenty of variation as new developers make their mark on the genre. There are plenty of titles to choose from nowadays, but not all of them are winners. If you need some help deciding what to install next, here are 11 of the best asymmetrical multiplayer games to play in 2022.
