According to various reports, some owners of the Pixel 8 Pro are seeing a yellow or pink tint on parts of the screen — usually near the top or sides — which apparently only shows up only when the device’s Always On Display is activated.
Specifically, it seems that text that should show as white is appearing as yellow before turning a reddish-pink after several seconds.
I did a Pixel 8 and OnePlus 11 camera test. Picking a winner wasn’t easy 4 AI features I want in my next iPhone The Google Pixel 8 just got its first update. Here’s what’s new Some comments in forums discussing the issue have suggested it could be linked to the Pixel 8 Pro’s variable refresh rate of between 1Hz and 120Hz as the off-white text only seems to appear when the display is running at 1Hz.
The more affordable Pixel 8’s refresh rate runs between 60Hz and 120Hz and doesn’t appear to be experiencing the issue.
That said, it’s not altogether clear if it’s a hardware or software problem, and Google has yet to publicly acknowledge it. However, a number of Pixel 8 Pro owners are claiming to have been offered a replacement Pixel 8 Pro by Google after they got in touch about the issue.
As complaints mount, you’d like to think that Google engineers are already investigating the apparent fault and will be in a position to offer a solution soon.
There are worse problems for a phone to have, but if you’d rather not see the off-white text on your Pixel 8 Pro’s display, try switching off the Always On Display and also the variable refresh rate. After that, sit tight and hope for a fix. Or get in touch with Google.
By most accounts, the Pixel Pro 8 is a great device, notable for its superb design, vibrant display, outstanding cameras, and long-term support, among other positives. In Digital Trends’ hands-on review , the phone only fell short on three counts: battery life, charging speed, and the puzzling inclusion of a temperature sensor.
Editors' Recommendations Google is finally fixing an annoying issue with its Pixel phones I’ve had the Google Pixel 8 Pro for a month. Here’s why I’m keeping it Google’s Pixel phones are in trouble I tested the Pixel 8 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro. This one has the best camera This one Google Pixel 8 Pro feature is driving me crazy Google Tech News Mobile Android 14 introduced a host of convenient additions to Google’s Pixel phones, but a recent minor update has utterly broken the storage system for some users. Specifically, owners of the Google Pixel 6, Google Pixel 6 Pro, and Google Pixel 6a who run multiple profiles on their phones are reporting that their phones no longer have access to the storage pipeline for the main profile.
That means users are locked out of accessing the stored media and find themselves unable to add new files as well. A few users have reported on Reddit and Google’s official community forum that they can’t even click images using the camera app because it flashes an insufficient storage warning message. A few others say trying to install an APK package also returns a similar storage writing roadblock.
Mobile Not long ago, it seemed that the Google Pixel 7a would be the last smartphone in Google's Pixel A series. However, recent rumors indicate that this may not be the case anymore.
As a result, we're likely to see the release of a Google Pixel 8a in the coming year. What can we expect from this new budget phone in terms of its specs, design, price, and more? Let's take a closer look at everything we know (so far) about the Google Pixel 8a.
Google Pixel 8a: release date Mobile Hi, my name is Joe, and I have a cloud storage problem.
It all happened this past Saturday. It was a rainy and chilly fall afternoon, I was getting ready to meet up with some friends for drinks, and there I was — sitting at my Mac mini, signing up for a 2TB Google One plan so I could store all of my pictures in Google Photos.
