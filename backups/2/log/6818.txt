Why trust us? Denon’s small-room 8K AV receivers start at $549 By Simon Cohen Close Denon AVR-S770H AV receiver in black.
Denon Denon has added two new S-Series 8K-capable AV receivers that are aimed at small- and medium-sized rooms. The AVR-S670H ($549) is a 5.2-channel model, and the AVR-S770H ($649) is a 7.2-channel, Dolby Atmos -capable receiver. Both models are available for preorder starting July 25 and are expected to ship by mid-August.

Denon The AVR-S670H combines Dolby TrueHD and DTS HD Master Audio surround sound formats with Audyssey MultEQ room correction technology, along with six HDMI inputs (three of which are 8K-capable), and one HDMI output. It has full support for HDMI 2.1 including 4K at 120Hz, variable refresh rates (VRR), and auto low-latency mode (ALLM), but it does not support Quick Media Switching (QMS). All major versions of HDR including Dolby Vision and HDR10+ are included. With five power amplifiers, it can pump out 75 watts per channel.
In addition to Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity, the AVR is compatible with Apple AirPlay 2 and Denon’s HEOS system for wireless multiroom music streaming, which can be controlled via an app on a smartphone , tablet, or PC. There’s a dedicated phono input for moving-magnet style turntable cartridges, and it’s compatible with Google Assistant , Amazon Alexa , and Apple HomeKit for Siri voice commands.
Denon AVR-X6800H: 8K everywhere and Dirac Live compatibility Samsung debuts Premiere 8K UST projector at CES 2023 with images up to 150 inches Denon updates 8K AV receivers with prices starting at $399 The AVR-770H takes all of the features of the S670H and adds 3D immersive sound support with Dolby Atmos and DTS:X, with two additional channels of 75-watt amplification. It also adds an available second zone that can receive its own stereo signal.
Denon last released an update to its AVR lineup in 2022, with a full refresh including A-, X-, and S-Series models, however, the S-Series, which is Denon’s most affordable selection, didn’t have any models in the $450-$850 price. The new S670H and S770H fill this gap.
Denon AVR-S670H Denon AVR-S770H Editors' Recommendations Samsung’s biggest Neo QLED 8K TV comes with an equally huge price Is 8K TV dying? It’s not looking good at CES 2023 Marantz’s new Cinema series AV receivers are a stylish way to go 8K 8K TV: Everything you need to know about television’s future Sony claims mini-LED superiority with 2022 8K and 4K TVs Speakers Tech News Virtual Reality Audio / Video We're still several weeks away from CES 2022, but don't tell Hisense that. The company has decided it doesn't need a big, splashy Las Vegas show to show off its big, splashy new Roku TV, which also happens to be its first Roku TV to offer 8K resolution: The Hisense U800GR, which is available December 8 from Best Buy and Amazon for $2,700.
The U800GR packs Hisense's ULED display technology, which in this case means a quantum dot LED panel with a native 120Hz refresh rate and up to 1,000 nits of brightness. Gamers will appreciate the extra smoothness this brings to their fast-action games, as well as the TV's support of auto low-latency mode (ALLM) and variable refresh rate (VRR). You get Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos support, in addition to HDR10 and HLG. Hisense says there are 180 local dimming zones for better contrast and black levels.
Audio / Video For those looking to take advantage of their new 8K TV, or who simply want to future-proof themselves, Denon has three new 8K A/V receivers to choose from, starting with the affordable, $449 AVR-S660H, the step-up $549 AVR-S760H, and the premium $699 AVR-X1700H. All three models will be available starting in November.
The new A/V receivers are all capable of passing through 8K/60Hz and 4K/120Hz signals via HDMI and are compatible with virtually every HDR video format including Dolby Vision, HDR10, HDR10+, Dynamic HDR, HLG, and BT.2020. They can process Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD Master Audio, and all three models include Denon's HEOS wireless, multiroom streaming software, so they can be controlled by the HEOS app and grouped with other HEOS-capable Denon speakers.
Audio / Video TCL has been teasing us for months, making us wait to hear how much the company will charge for its 8K resolution 6-Series mini-LED QLED TVs. Now we know, and boy, was it worth the wait. The 75-inch model is just $3,000, while the smaller, 65-inch version rings in at $2,200. They both go on sale today with limited availability at major retailers.
To put those prices in perspective, LG and Samsung -- the only other companies that have mini-LED-based 8K TVs in 2021 -- charge $3,500 for their most affordable 65-inch models and $4,800 for their 75-inch models.
