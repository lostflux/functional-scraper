 But now, it’s time to look ahead at all of the upcoming movies set for release in late 2023 and early 2024.
Upcoming movies in October 2023 Upcoming movies in November 2023 Upcoming movies in December 2023 Upcoming movies in January 2024 Upcoming movies in February 2024 Upcoming movies in March 2024 Upcoming movies in April 2024 Upcoming Movies in May 2024 Upcoming movies in June 2024 Upcoming movies in July 2024 Upcoming movies in August 2024 Upcoming movies in September 2024 Upcoming movies in October 2024 Upcoming movies in November 2024 Upcoming movies in December 2024 As you may have heard, the word out of Hollywood is that the WGA and the AMPTP have reached a tentative deal to end the writers’ strike.
 Presumably ending the SAG-AFTRA strike will be the next thing on the agenda. This is important to keep in mind for the upcoming movies because all films and TV shows have been at a standstill for months, and the 2024 release dates are tentative at best. That’s one of the reasons why the 2024 schedule looks so empty at the moment. There’s a lot of work that needs to be done by both the writers and the actors before a lot of these movies are going to be ready, so don’t be too shocked if the release dates change again. Some of them could even slip into 2025.
For now, let’s just celebrate the potential end of labor strife in Hollywood and start making plans for our movie nights this year and beyond.

Here’s why you should watch it The best movies on Disney+ right now (November 2023) Entertainment Sci-fi is one of those genres that is fun to watch any time, with movies that skew toward everything from comedy to horror, drama, suspense, and more. When it comes to Amazon Freevee, there’s a wide selection of sci-fi movies you can watch for free, with ads.
Along with high-profile titles from the past (you won’t find new releases here), and underrated action movies on Amazon Freevee, as well as other genres, there are a few underrated sci-fi movies on Amazon Freevee you should watch in November, too. They’re all critically acclaimed, come from various decades, and feature top-notch casts.
The Pink Cloud (2021) The Pink Cloud- Official Trailer- Sundance Selection Entertainment Halloween Horror is now a thing of the past on Peacock, at least until next year. Now Peacock can shift the focus away from horror flicks and back to some of the best titles from the film catalog of Universal Pictures. There are even some movies on loan from other studios, including The Hunger Games, and the first three John Wick films. This month also features the return to Peacock of Martin Scorsese's Casino and the unforgettable Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.
While Peacock has a wide selection of new titles, the streamer also has a heavy turnover from month to month. In other words, your favorite movie may be here this month, but it could just as easily be gone when December rolls around. Keep that in mind as you go over our updated list of the best movies on Peacock right now. There are two holiday weekends this month, so you have time to make your viewing plans.
Entertainment Peacock doesn't always get a chance to strut its stuff, but it does have an impressive lineup of films. They just don't stick around for long compared to the other streamers. Keep this in mind when we share our picks for the three underrated movies on Peacock. Most content new on Peacock has a very short shelf life.
This month, our picks include a hilarious mocumentary, a largely forgotten superhero flick, and a romantic comedy about the end of the world. These are the three underrated movies on Peacock you need to watch in November.
