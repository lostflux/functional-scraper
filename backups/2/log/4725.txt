But in April this year, Musk finally promised that a delivery event would be taking place in the third quarter, which, if he keeps his word, should be announced any day now.
In July, the electric car maker also posted a photo showing the first Cybertruck to roll off the production line at Tesla‚Äôs Giga Texas facility in Austin.

Tesla says Cybertruck resellers could face harsh penalties Watch how Tesla‚Äôs Cybertruck handles a compound bow‚Äôs arrow Tesla‚Äôs Cybertruck finally gets a delivery date According to earlier reports, Tesla has received more than 1 million preorders for the Cybertruck, with customers paying a refundable $100 deposit.
Pricing for the electric pickup has yet to be determined. It used to show on the company‚Äôs website but was removed toward the end of 2021 for an undisclosed reason. At the time, it showed three variants of the Cybertruck starting at $39,900 and topping out at $69,900, depending on features such as the number of electric motors, towing capacity, and range. Many expect that the final pricing will be more expensive, but Tesla‚Äôs recent habit of cutting the prices of its existing vehicles to make them more appealing in an increasingly competitive market means we‚Äôll just have to wait and see which way the automaker goes.
There‚Äôs no telling how successful the Cybertruck will be in the long term. Even Musk, the man running the Tesla show, appears uncertain. In April, for example, he sounded ultra-enthusiastic, tweeting shortly after a visit to the production line: ‚ÄúGonna be awesome ‚Ä¶ feels like the future.‚Äù But a couple of years ago he also admitted that the vehicle‚Äôs quirky design meant there was ‚Äúsome chance that Cybertruck will flop.‚Äù Currently, he sounds super-positive, tweeting on Wednesday : ‚ÄúI think this is our best product ever.‚Äù Editors' Recommendations Tesla U-turns on controversial rule for Cybertruck resellers Lucid joins other automakers by adopting Tesla charging plug Toyota joins ‚Äòthe Tesla plug‚Äô club Volkswagen ID.4 vs Tesla Model Y The fastest electric cars, ranked by 0-60 mph acceleration Tech News Tesla Cars Aside from building electric cars, batteries, and solar panels, Tesla is also looking to build a Supercharger station with a difference.

Cars EV manufacturers have long claimed that while electric cars often cost more upfront, they‚Äôll save you money in the long run thanks to the lower cost of maintenance and the fact that electricity is cheaper than gas. While it's true that EVs are cheaper over the life of a car, a number of factors can affect how long it will take to recoup the upfront investment. You've probably considered the cost of charging at home and at public charging stations, but here's one factor catching EV buyers off guard: state registration fees.
Depending on where you live, you could pay hundreds of dollars more to register your car than drivers of gasoline cars do. Here's why that's happening, how much it's costing EV drivers, and whether you should be concerned.
Why are states imposing EV taxes? There are some good reasons why electric car registration fees are higher than those for gas cars. In most states, there‚Äôs a gas tax that‚Äôs usually at least 20 cents per gallon, and sometimes much more. California, for instance, charges 58 cents per gallon. That tax usually goes to things like road upkeep.
