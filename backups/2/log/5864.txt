Why trust us? The best PSVR games for 2023 By Joseph Yaden and Giovanni Colantonio Close The PSVR headset was an incredible piece of tech when it launched in 2016. It’s a bit outdated now, especially ahead of the PSVR2’s release in February 2023 — but that doesn’t take away from the excellent lineup of games on the original PSVR, ranging from shooters, action adventures, RPGs, platformers, and more family-friendly titles.
It can be daunting to try and figure out which ones are for you, so we’ve rounded up a list of the best games available for the headset.
These are the best PSVR games as of 2023.

If you've been gaming on a standard keyboard, or even the built-in on your laptop, it might be time to upgrade to a real gaming keyboard. Black Friday deals give you the option to buy some for as cheap as $20. We've pulled our favorite gaming keyboard deal currently available as well as some other good options like Logitech, Razer and Corsair.
Best gaming keyboard Black Friday deal Our favorite gaming keyboard deal in early Black Friday sales is this discount on the ASUS ROG Strix Flare RGB Mechanical Keyboard. The Asus ROG Strix Flare II topped the list of the best gaming keyboards, so it's only fitting that the older model would be our favorite current deal. You can grab the Strix Flare I for $110 at Walmart, which is $41 off its regular price of $151. This is an early Black Friday deal, but that doesn't mean it will stick around for the rest of the shopping holiday.
Gaming If your chair is ripping apart or just plain not comfortable anymore, now is a great time to get a new one. As it turns out, Black Friday deals are in full swing, even though it is earlier than when we would traditionally start thinking about the shopping holiday. That means you can get tons of gaming chairs, including some of the best gaming chairs, for incredibly low prices. At this point, one deal is sticking out to us like a sore thumb. As a result, we'll be putting extra attention on it during this article. However, if you want a more comprehensive list of great early Black Friday gaming chair deals, we've got them at the bottom.
Best gaming chair Black Friday deal The blue AKRacing Core Series EX Gaming Chair is our favorite Black Friday deal so far, and for many reasons. To start with obvious factors, it is discounted by over 25%. You can get your blue AKRacing Core Series EX Gaming Chair for $280 today, while it would be $400 on a regular day. That's a savings of $120. Another big factor is that it is an official Best Buy Black Friday deal, and is labelled as such. That gives us a ton of confidence in its price being the best price available.
Gaming Every gamer needs a gaming headset, whether for a more immersive experience during single-player adventures or to properly communicate with your teammates during online multiplayer matches. If you don't have one yet, or you want to upgrade from a basic model, you should consider going for the Logitech G733 Lightspeed wireless gaming headset, which is on sale from Amazon at 20% off. Instead of $150, you'll only have to pay $120 for savings of $30, but you'll have to proceed with your purchase quickly because there's no telling when this bargain will get taken down.
Why you should buy the Logitech G733 Lightspeed wireless gaming headset The Logitech G733 Lightspeed wireless gaming headset is a popular choice among shoppers, with an average rating of 4.5 stars out of 5 stars on Amazon after nearly 14,000 reviews. Similar to the best gaming headsets, it offers excellent audio quality with Logitech's PRO-G drivers that minimize distortion and surround sound that makes you feel like you're in the middle of the action. When speaking to other players, your voice will be crystal clear thanks to the Logitech G733 Lightspeed's broadcast-quality microphone, and it's also certified for Discord, a chat app that's designed specifically for gamers.
