Xbox has Game Pass , PlayStation has PlayStation Plus , and Nintendo Switch offers the Nintendo Switch Online program.
While Nintendo’s service isn’t on the same level as the other two across PlayStation and Xbox, it does give subscribers access to some of the best retro games of all time — and even more if you have the Expansion Pack upgrade, which includes N64, Sega Genesis, and Game Boy Advance games, along with DLC packs for certain Switch titles. Included with the basic version of the Nintendo Switch Online subscription is the ability to play online, plus access to NES and SNES games.
Whether you’re a basic member or you’ve upgraded to the Expansion Pack, there are plenty of fantastic games to enjoy via Nintendo’s subscription. But which are the best? These are the best games on Nintendo Switch Online.

This is due to its top-down presentation and sprite-based visuals that hold up better than what you’d find in the Zelda games on N64.
A Link to the Past is regarded as one of the greatest games of all time thanks to the way it streamlined many of the designs first introduced in earlier installments. It feels like a massive evolution in nearly every way, from its gameplay to its visuals and sounds. This is an epic adventure that feels monumental, with plenty of quirky characters and a huge world to explore, paving the way for immersive action games.

It’s a game that nails stripping you of your abilities while slowly giving them back as you advance, with a satisfying sense of progression that never gets old. There’s so much to do and see, and the game encourages you to explore as much as possible, giving you new upgrades to make things ever-so-slightly easier. The creatures in Super Metroid are bar-none some of the best things about it, along with its overall level design that makes the game so much fun to explore.

One thing we love is just how creepy it is, with a slew of weird characters who mostly have incredibly tragic backstories. The entire game has such a horrifying presence due to the moon inching closer and closer to Earth each day, with an overwhelming sense of doom. Beyond that, the time travel mechanics are wild and — when you get the hang of them — are satisfying to play with, offering a unique experience that remains one of the most memorable Zelda games to date.

Gaming The Nintendo Switch is one of the bestselling consoles of all time, and with the additions of the Switch Lite and the Switch OLED , that shouldn't change anytime soon. Nintendo paid a lot of attention to playing on the go when designing the Switch, and, thankfully, there are numerous ways to enjoy your system in the living room, too.
The Joy-Con grip is fine — we'll get to just how well it can work later on — but a proper controller makes the Switch feel much more like a home console. It doesn't matter if you prefer fast first-person shooters or slow narrative-driven experiences, our list of the best Nintendo Switch controllers has a gamepad for you. We'll also include a list of frequently asked controller-related questions at the bottom of this article.
Gaming During the November 2023 Indie World Showcase, it was revealed that many intriguing indie titles are coming to the Nintendo Switch over the next year. One of the show's biggest announcements was that Outer Wilds -- a critically acclaimed sci-fi game about exploring a solar system throughout repeating time loops -- is finally coming to the Nintendo Switch next month.
A Nintendo Switch port for Outer Wilds was first teased in 2021 and intended to be released during the summer of that year, but it did not make that release window. We did not hear much else about the port until now outside of a mention during one of publisher Annapurna Interactive's own showcases. An Indie World Showcase segment dedicated to the game showed some of its physics-based spacefaring gameplay in action on the Switch, and it seemed to look nice and run at a solid frame rate. Called Outer Wilds: Archaeologist Edition, this version of the game comes with the Echoes of the Eye DLC and will launch digitally on December 7. It will get a physical Switch release sometime next year.
