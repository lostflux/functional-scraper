The beloved battle royale is overflowing with things to do, and weekly updates ensure that there are always new weapons and items to engage with, fresh locales to visit on its ever-changing map, and plenty of XP to earn via daily and weekly challenges.
With so much to keep players coming back for more, you can be certain finding a lobby filled with other folks is an easy thing to do. But you’ve also probably noticed that many matches — particularly in lower and mid-tier lobbies — mix bots in with real players. This helps to fill out lobbies faster so you can get in and play consistently, and it also serves as a way to ensure that everyone in the match has a few opportunities to eliminate some baddies regardless of their skill level.
If you’re only looking to complete objectives, though, real players can prove to be frustrating. Luckily, there’s a way to make it so that only bots appear in your match. Here’s a useful tip that can guarantee you get lobbies that are populated exclusively by bots any time you’re seeking a more chill experience.

Best gaming console deals: cheapest prices on PS5, Xbox S and X and Switch The best traits to level first in Remnant 2 How to get bot lobbies in Fortnite Most matches have at least a few bots, but if you’d like to guarantee every enemy in your match is a bot, we’ve got a foolproof way to make that happen. Here’s a step-by-step process.
The first thing you need is a second brand-new Fortnite account that has never completed a full match.
 The first match played by a new account is always exclusively against bots, and you’re going to be taking advantage of this. You can head over to the Epic Games account registration page to create a new account using your email, Google, Facebook, or a variety of other methods.
Secondly, you’ll need an additional platform to put this account on. One of the easiest methods is to simply download the game on a mobile device or tablet so that it’s easy for you to access while also using your main account on your primary platform. When you’ve decided on a platform for your second account, sign in there, download any updates, and then log in to the game.
When you’ve got your second account loaded up on your other platform, add your primary account as a friend.
Have one of the two accounts invite the other to a party, then ready up and start a match. This match will be entirely populated by bots, but there’s one more requirement if you wish to continue using this trick, so don’t skip the next step.
Here’s the most important part of this process: As soon as the match begins, immediately have the second account leave the lobby.
 This is vital because you need to ensure that the second account never completes a match.
 This makes certain that every future match you enter with this account will be registered as its “first match” and will always be filled exclusively with bots.
When you finish a match using this method, you can invite the second account back and start the process over as many times as you’d like, making this an ideal way to knock out daily and weekly quests. You can also invite other friends to the party and let them join in on the fun whenever you’d like, which can be especially great for introducing young or new players to the game for a few casual matches before they have to face real people.
Just remember that wins you score in bot lobbies won’t award a crown , so just use this trick to kick back and enjoy some leisure time in Fortnite.

The addition of perks bumps up those options even further, granting you the ability to equip badges that improve certain aspects of protagonist Cal Kestis' kit, such as increasing XP earned or improving his ability to break the guard of his foes. Some are found by exploring, while others are purchased from a particular vendor and unlocked fairly early in the game. A handful of perks are unlocked only after beating the game and starting New Game Plus.
Each of these perks uses a certain number of perk slots when equipped, so you'll have to make some tough decisions about which ones you want to have active at any one time. Luckily, exploring the galaxy will net you some additional perk slots, so you'll be able to equip more as you get further in your adventure. Even with all of the perk slots unlocked, however, you'll still want to strongly consider which perks will benefit you best. We'll make that a bit easier on you by listing all of the perks you can find in Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, what boons they offer, and how many perk slots they'll take up.
Perks discovered by exploring These perks are found by thoroughly exploring the world and completing objectives. You may have to overcome some pretty tough challenges to find them all.
Gaming Star Wars Jedi: Survivor takes place five years after its predecessor, and Cal Kestis has definitely gained some new Jedi tricks during the time that has passed. While there are some returning features that you're likely to recognize and appreciate, there are also a wide variety of new mechanics, skills, and more to check out in this highly anticipated follow-up. Among those new additions are an expanded set of lightsaber stances that allow you to decide what kind of fighter you want Cal to be. Whether you want to strike fast at the cost of defense, take things slower with bolstered protection, or find the middle ground between the two, you have five options that can ensure you'll find what works for you.
How to change stances You can have two stances equipped at one time, and switching between them can be done on the fly, allowing you to weave together different elements of your two chosen kits. However, you can only change stances at a meditation point, so you'll need to be sure that you've thought things through pretty well before heading out into dangerous areas. To help you with your decision-making, here are all of the stances in Jedi Survivor and how they work.
Single Blade Stance This stance is unlocked from the beginning of the game.
Gaming From endless hordes of Empire goons to hulking Rancors that can crush you in one or two hits, there are no doubt a lot of things to be afraid of in EA's new action-adventure sequel Star Wars Jedi: Survivor. However, if one of your fears happens to be spiders, developer Respawn has got you covered with an arachnophobia toggle that completely removes spiders from the game.
Survivor's Arachnophobia Safe Mode ensures that players who aren't particularly fond of eight-legged creepy-crawlies will never have to engage with any spiders that might crawl their way on-screen partway through the campaign. It's an unexpected addition to a game that is otherwise filled to the brim with strange and unsettling creatures to observe and fight, but spiders no doubt have a special way of freaking some of us out. Many folks are certain to appreciate seeing a choice to avoid arachnids altogether when they find themselves scrolling through the game's suite of accessibility options.
