Why trust us? What iPhone do I have? How to find out your iPhone model number By Jesse Hollington Close Joe Maring / Digital Trends Since its landmark introduction in 2007, Apple has released a total of 38 different iPhone models, and with at least four new ones introduced every fall , the company is showing no signs of slowing down.
How to find out which iPhone you have What to do if you can’t turn on or unlock your iPhone A full list of all 38 iPhone models In all that time, Apple has made relatively few significant design changes. The company tends to stick with established designs for three or four years before changing things up, which can sometimes make it difficult to tell which iPhone model you have — especially if you’re getting a secondhand iPhone (with no box to offer a hint) rather than a new one.
For instance, while an iPhone 14 Pro Max is a very obviously different beast from an iPhone 8 , you’d have a much harder time differentiating it from an iPhone 13 Pro Max or even an iPhone 12 Pro Max without a trained eye. Likewise, Apple deliberately chose to use the iPhone 8 design for its 2020 and 2022 iPhone SE models, making it nearly impossible to tell those three apart.
In some cases, a unique color might provide a clue, and there are other cues that those who are very familiar with Apple’s iPhones could know to look for. Of course, most folks don’t have the time for that kind of minutiae of Apple product design, so you’ll be happy to know there’s a much easier way to find out what model of iPhone you’re holding in your hand.
How to find out which iPhone you have Jesse Hollington / Digital Trends Presuming the iPhone is in working condition, and you can unlock it, the easiest way to identify it is to open the Settings app, then select General > About.
This page provides a lot of useful information about your iPhone, including its model number and also the model name if you’re running iOS 12.2 or later. You can also see what version of iOS is installed, the serial number, and information on AppleCare coverage, storage capacity, and technical information on its Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and cellular hardware.
If you’re dealing with an older iPhone that hasn’t been updated to at least iOS 12.2, then you’ll only see the model number, so you’ll need to do a bit more digging to find out what specific model name it corresponds to.
There are actually two model numbers involved here. The one that’s shown by default is actually your iPhone’s “part number” — a specific code that corresponds to the storage capacity, color, and region of your iPhone. It usually begins with an “M,” although it could be an “N” or an “F” if you’re dealing with a replacement or refurbished iPhone.
However, the number you really want to see — the actual model number — is hidden behind the part number. Tap the number beside Model Number, and it will change to a shorter five-character code that starts with the letter “A.” This is the model number that’s common to all colors and storage capacities.
Jesse Hollington / Digital Trends For example, while MQ9E3VC/A is specifically for a Deep Purple, 256GB iPhone 14 Pro Max sold in Canada, the same A2893 model number is used for all variants of the iPhone 14 Pro Max sold in Canada, Guam, Japan, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, and the U.S. Virgin Islands — regardless of color or storage capacity.
Note that Apple typically sells unique base models of each iPhone in various areas of the world to handle different 5G or LTE frequencies.
 For instance, the iPhone 14 Pro sold in the U.S. that offers mmWave capabilities has a model number of A2650, while the A2889 version sold in Canada supports only sub-6GHz 5G.
 Apple provides a list of which 5G and LTE carriers and bands are supported by each model, which is a handy way to check if an iPhone you’ve received secondhand is fully compatible with the cellular networks where you live.
What to do if you can’t turn on or unlock your iPhone Andy Boxall / Digital Trends While looking in the Settings app is the easiest way by far to find out what model of iPhone you’re using, that won’t be an option if you can’t actually get to that screen. For example, you may want to know the model of an iPhone that’s been damaged or won’t turn on so you can decide whether it’s worth repairing.
If you’re dealing with an iPhone 7 or older model, then you can find the model number written in the fine print on the back, along with all the other regulatory information. However, that won’t be an option for newer models. As a result of the the E-LABEL Act , Apple stopped stamping all of that information on the rear case of the iPhone starting in 2018. That means the iPhone 8, iPhone X , and all newer models don’t have the model number etched onto the back.
Digital Trends Fortunately, the model number is still engraved on the iPhone — it’s just in a far less obvious place. Instead, Apple has etched it in really fine print into the SIM tray slot. You’ll need really good eyes or a magnifying glass to see it, but if you pop out your SIM tray and squint at the inside edge of where it slides in, you can find the A-series model number hidden on the display side.
If you’re using an iPhone 14 without a physical SIM card slot , you’ll find the model number inside the Lightning connector instead.
A full list of all 38 iPhone models Joe Maring / Digital Trends Once you’ve found the model number for your iPhone, you can check the following list to match it up. This is a list of every iPhone model that Apple has ever launched, from most recent to oldest, including all the model numbers for each region.
