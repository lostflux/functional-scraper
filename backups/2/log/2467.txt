Not only does it capture 2K footage and offer free 12-second video recording, but it also features a microSD card slot for local storage — all for just $40.
That’s an impressive list considering its low price. The microSD card slot is the big selling point, as few products in this price range offer the coveted feature. Having a video doorbell with an onboard microSD slot means you can record continuous footage both day and night. When the sun goes down, it also offers color night vision for improved clarity.
The onboard microSD card slot allows it to record up to six seconds of footage prior to the motion event, ensuring you never miss anything happening at your front door. Few video doorbells offer similar features, let alone at a price under $50. An alternative would be to use a Ring Video Doorbell with a Ring Alarm Pro station, though these setups can cost upwards of $200.
Ring Battery Doorbell Plus offers improved battery life and new aspect ratio Swann dives into home security with new video doorbell and window sensor The new Wyze Cam Pan v2 lets you set up a custom patrol route Other notable features include a 166.8-degree field-of-view, support for mechanical chimes thanks to an included smart chime controller, and smart notifications (when subscribed to Cam Plus). Keep in mind that the $40 video doorbell doesn’t include a microSD card, though you can bundle in a 128GB card for an extra $15.
As you’d expect, the Wyze Video Doorbell v2 is IP65 weatherproof and supports common smart home platforms like Alexa , Google Assistant , and IFTTT. Considering the video doorbell costs just $40, there are a lot of great features packed into the tiny device. It may not look as premium as some of the best video doorbells on the market, but it’s a solid option for shoppers on a budget.
Keep in mind that Wyze had some security issues in 2022, so it might be worth looking at alternatives if privacy is a concern.
Editors' Recommendations Arlo Video Doorbell 2nd Gen vs. Ring Video Doorbell Pro 2 New Xfinity Home Video Doorbell coming soon to all Xfinity customers Wyze Video Doorbell Pro gets double the features at double the price Ring Video Doorbell Wired vs. Video Doorbell Pro 2 Ring Video Doorbell 2020 vs. Ring Video Doorbell Pro 2 Home Security Tech News Video Doorbells Smart Home Ring's latest addition to its lineup of smart home security devices demonstrates exactly where the company is headed. The Ring Video Doorbell Pro 2 is a new, premium video doorbell with a host of next-generation technology to help keep your home safer than ever. The camera features 3D motion detection, 1,536p video, a Bird's Eye View feature, and customizable privacy.
Through the use of a radar sensor, the 3D motion detection technology provides more accurate and precise identification of when a motion event begins. The sensors measure an object's distance from the camera, which makes it easier to exclude certain high-traffic areas. For example, if your doorbell faces a sidewalk, you can set it so that only motion closer to your home triggers an alert.
Smart Home Wyze is a major name in the home security world, particularly with regard to home security on a budget. The company has been relentless of late, announcing a slew of new smart home devices like a smart thermostat and video doorbell. With today's announcement, though, it's back to security cameras with the new Wyze Cam v3 -- both an indoor and outdoor cam priced at just $20, making it one of the most affordable options for home security on the market.
The low price includes a tremendous number of features, including a starlight sensor that helps grant color night vision. Almost no smart cameras have an advanced feature like color night vision at this price point. It also has a black-and-white night vision for areas where there is next to no light available.
Smart Home In the realm of smart home devices, video doorbells rarely fall under the umbrella of “affordable.” Wyze’s new Video Doorbell changes all of that. This tiny device is just $30, but delivers performance on par with that of devices that cost upward of $100 or more.
You’ll receive an instant push notification the moment someone rings the doorbell, and you can pull a livestream of the doorbell to decide whether you want to answer the door or not. Uninvited solicitor? Just act like you aren’t home.
