Our favorite Samsung tablet Black Friday deal More Samsung tablet Black Friday deals we love Our favorite Samsung tablet Black Friday deal Samsung The specifications of the Samsung Galaxy Tab A8 is far from what you’ll find in the best tablets , as it’s only equipped with an octa-core Unisoc processor and 3GB of RAM. However, for most people who only want to buy a tablet for basic functions like browsing the internet, checking social media, and watching streaming content, this device will prove to be more than enough. The Android tablet’s 10.5-inch touchscreen features 1920 x 1200 resolution, which makes it large and sharp for a budget device, and while internal storage is limited at 32GB, you can add more space for your photos and videos through an up to 1TB microSD card. Already affordable at its original price of $199, the Samsung Galaxy Tab A8 is currently even cheaper at $149 following a $50 discount from Walmart for Black Friday.

The Apple Watch is not cheap, but Black Friday deals can cut the price a bit. We've pulled our favorite Black Friday smartwatch deals on the most recent Apple Watch releases: SE, Series 9 and Ultra. The bottom of this list includes some deals on older models, too. These are all available right now, even though Black Friday is still a ways away.
Best Apple Watch SE Black Friday deals The Apple Watch SE is Apple's budget-friendly smartwatch option. If all you need in a smartwatch is health stats and some basic phone integration (and you need to stick with Apple), the SE is your best bet. The Apple Watch SE 2 is one of our favorite options, and we don't have much bad to say about it. If you're looking for something cheap and don't mind shopping beyond Apple, Fitbit Black Friday deals are taking off right now, and Fitbit offers similar functionality as the Apple Watch SE. Below you'll find some SE options with and without GPS, and both 44mm and 40mm.
Mobile There's no better time to take advantage of iPad deals than on Black Friday, as the discounts are the largest that they could be from the various retailers.

So that you can complete your purchase before stocks run out, we've rounded up the top offers that are available for the shopping holiday -- if you see a bargain that you like, push through with the transaction as soon as possible.
Best 10.2-inch iPad Black Friday deals The 10.2-inch Apple iPad, which includes the seventh to the ninth generations of the entry-level Apple iPad, remains one of the cheapest ways to jump into the iPad experience. They're not the latest models available, but they're still very capable devices because they can be upgraded to iPadOS 17, which is the newest version of Apple's operating system for tablets. If you want to get a 10.2-inch iPad for an even more affordable price, you may want to consider a refurbished one, especially since it would come with a return guarantee if it stops working properly.
