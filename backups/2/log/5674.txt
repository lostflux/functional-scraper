Wonder Direct: how to watch and what to expect What to expect from the November 2023 Indie World Showcase The official announcement tweet and press release for November 2023’s Indie World Showcase simply states that it will feature “new announcements and updates on indie games coming to Nintendo Switch.” In terms of previously featured Indie World games that still aren’t out, titles like Animal Well, Rift of the NecroDancer , and Pepper Grinder come to mind.
There are also plenty of memes on social media about Hollow Knight: Silksong showing up during the event; it’s a game people have wanted to see in one of these showcases for years, but it has never shown up. Ultimately, Indie World Showcases are tough to predict because they are typically curated roundups of intriguing indie games that most people don’t know about. You’ll have a better time watching November 2023’s Indie World Showcase if you go in with low expectations and just look forward to seeing some impressive indies you weren’t aware of before.
