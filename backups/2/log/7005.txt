By Jon Bitner Close Video doorbells are much more versatile than traditional doorbells, offering an easy way to see who’s at the front door from the convenience of your smartphone. But all the high-tech gear inside these fancy smart home devices isn’t as low-maintenance as you’d expect. In fact, many of them use batteries that will wear out after just a few years, forcing you to replace them.
How long are video doorbells supported by the manufacturer? How long do video doorbells last? But aside from battery life, your video doorbell, as a whole, probably won’t last as long as a traditional doorbell — which often sticks with a home for decades. Here’s a closer look at how long your video doorbell will be supported by the manufacturer, along with tips to help you decide when it’s time for a full replacement.
How long are video doorbells supported by the manufacturer? Google Video doorbells require various software updates to keep them running properly. These are typically pushed to your device automatically, but your video doorbell won’t be supported by the manufacturer forever. Most will get at least a few years of guaranteed support, but once it’s outdated and replaced with newer models, manufacturers tend to move on.
Tapo C120 vs. Ring Stick Up Cam Pro: is the expensive Ring security camera worth it? Arlo Video Doorbell 2nd Gen vs. Ring Video Doorbell Pro 2 The best outdoor security cameras of 2023 Google, for example, provides Nest updates for at least five years from the date the device first went on the market. So if you purchase a doorbell three years after it hits the market, you’re only guaranteed two years of automatic security updates. For the Nest Doorbell (battery), that means it’ll be supported until 2026. For the Nest Doorbell (wired), that’s 2027.
Ring’s support policy is slightly different. Instead of counting the days from when the product first emerged on the market, Ring offers four years of security updates from the last day the device is available on its website. For more details, check out the official Ring support page.
In general, you can expect at least five years of support for video doorbells. This can vary dramatically based on your product and manufacturer, and it’s highly recommended to check the FAQ and support pages for your prospective product before making a purchase.
How long do video doorbells last? Ring Once a company ends security support for a video doorbell, it’s usually still possible to keep running the device. You may run into issues — and you may not be comfortable using a device that could be vulnerable to hackers — but there typically isn’t anything stopping you from using an older product despite a lack of manufacturer support.
As for how many years a video doorbell will last before finally breaking — it’s hard to say. It’s possible for a video doorbell to last for years after entering the “end of life” phase, serving you without issue for a very, very long time.
However, it’s highly recommended you replace your video doorbell once it stops receiving support from the manufacturer. Manufacturer updates are there to keep things running as intended and prevent any security issues from arising.
And if you’re using an old device with little support, you’re not likely to have a smooth experience with your video doorbell.
In other words, you can expect to get around five years out of a video doorbell before needing a replacement. If you’re using a battery-powered doorbell that’s starting to act funny, consider replacing just the battery instead of the entire doorbell. This should give you a bit more longevity.
Editors' Recommendations The 11 best smart home products that support Matter The best smart home devices for 2023 The best video doorbells for 2023 The best smart displays for 2023 How often should you replace your robot vacuum? Google Nest Home Security Video Doorbells Smart Home Wyze is a popular destination for smart home shoppers seeking premium features on a budget, and the new Wyze Video Doorbell v2 might be its most enticing product yet. Not only does it capture 2K footage and offer free 12-second video recording, but it also features a microSD card slot for local storage -- all for just $40.
That's an impressive list considering its low price. The microSD card slot is the big selling point, as few products in this price range offer the coveted feature. Having a video doorbell with an onboard microSD slot means you can record continuous footage both day and night. When the sun goes down, it also offers color night vision for improved clarity.
Smart Home Matter launched around a year ago, and its newly released 1.2 update is bringing tons of improvements to the interoperability standard. The biggest improvement is expanded access, with Matter now supported by nine more different types of devices, including fridges, dishwashers, laundry machines, air purifiers, robot vacuums, and other common smart home gadgets.
While Matter has long been praised for its ability to connect products designed for different ecosystems (allowing you to use HomeKit items with Amazon Alexa, for example), it was held back by its limited rollout. When it first launched, only a handful of categories were supported -- such as smart bulbs, smart plugs, and smart sensors.
Smart Home While your traditional HVAC system can filter out dust, pollen, and other airborne particulates, sometimes it simply isn’t enough to keep your air as clean as you’d like. That’s where air purifiers come into play, as these secondary devices can be placed anywhere around your home to provide additional cleaning power.
They can also be incredibly helpful during the cold winter months when windows and doors stay closed -- preventing you from airing out all the allergens floating around your home.
