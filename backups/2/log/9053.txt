While past hits like The Last of Us are still available for consumption, Max is set to welcome a few fan-favorite films, as well as the streaming debut of one of summer’s standout hits.
Max’s October 2023 schedule includes the returns of The Gilded Age and Our Flag Means Death for their second seasons. In addition, the cult DC comics superhero show Doom Patrol emerges from its slumber with its final batch of episodes. Finally, this month marks the home premiere of the Jason Statham action movie Meg 2: The Trench.
 Max in October is the place for you if you like all kinds of content.

And it starts with a new series, A People’s History of Native America. The first episode of that show looks at what really happened to Pocahontas, and how her tragic tale was sanitized and turned into a pop culture legend that had little to do with the truth.
Many of last month's best shows on PBS, including Little Bird and World on Fire, will continue during November. However, for our monthly guide to everything coming to PBS in November, we're focusing on the new series and specials.
A People’s History of Native America on PBS Origins New Series Premiere: Wednesday, November 1 Entertainment The kickoff for the Christmas season used to be the day after Thanksgiving. Now it looks like it's the day after Halloween. HBO and Max are joining the other streamers by adding a ton of Christmas-related movies and specials in November. 'Tis the season, and all that. But it's probably because there aren't as many Thanksgiving movies as there are for Christmas.
Aside from the holiday programming, it's a pretty quiet month on Max. The only HBO scripted series of note is the new season of Rap Sh!t, which has a title that was made for premium cable. Curiously, Max is also adding off-brand direct-to-video sequels Mean Girls 2 and Legally Blondes. The next thing you know, Max will probably get all of those American Pie spinoffs we tried so hard to forget.
Entertainment There are only two months left in 2023, but Amazon Prime Video saved one of its best original shows for November. Invincible is back for its second season on Friday, November 3, and it takes superhero action to the next level. Much like Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, Invincible is able to do more with the comic book style and storylines in animation than anything in live-action can match. It's also a show that isn't afraid to go into darker territory.
The Christmas movies are also out in force this month on Prime Video, including eight different VeggieTales Christmas flicks ... which seems excessive. Fortunately, there's a lot of non-holiday fare to enjoy, like the first five Fast and Furious films, as well as Master And Commander: The Far Side of the World, which is celebrating its 20th anniversary this month.
