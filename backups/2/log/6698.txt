The news comes on the same day that Apple announced it will be adding support for Dolby Atmos and lossless audio on Apple Music for no extra charge.
New and existing subscribers to the Amazon Music Unlimited Individual Plan ($8 per month for Prime members and $10 per month for Amazon customers) or the Family Plan ($15 per month) can now upgrade to Amazon Music HD at no extra cost.
What is a network music streamer and why do you need one? The Canadian company that owns NAD and Bluesound now owns MQA What is Amazon Music: everything you need to know Amazon Music HD has a catalog of more than 70 million lossless, CD-quality songs, with a bit depth of 16 bits and a sample rate of 44.1kHz.
However, there are also more than 7 million songs available in better-than-CD-quality hi-res audio at a bit depth of 24 bits and a sample rate up to 192 kHz. Amazon Music HD has added more than 5 million songs to its hi-res catalog since its 2019 launch. Amazon claims this is the largest available selection of music in the hi-res format.
Amazon Music HD also provides a growing selection of tracks in 3D Audio formats such as Dolby Atmos Music and Sony 360 Reality Audio.
 Currently, Dolby Atmos tracks can only be streamed on Amazon’s own Echo Studio smart speaker.
 Meanwhile, Sony 360RA tracks will also work on Sony’s RA5000 and RA3000 speakers by using Alexa Cast.
The Amazon Music HD tier was previously an additional $5 a month for current subscribers to the Individual or Family Plan. For current subscribers to Amazon Music HD, there will be no extra charge for HD starting with their next billing cycle.

The hi-fi streaming music service fully explained Amazon Music Streaming Services Tech News Audio / Video Tidal has said that starting today, select subscribers will be able to access its catalog of music in hi-res lossless audio that uses the open-source FLAC format. The announcement was made via a Reddit post in which CEO Jesse Dorogusker said that hi-res FLAC tracks, in up to 24-bit/192kHz resolution, are now available to the company's Early Access Program (EAP) users on iOS. Dorogusker says the company wants feedback from this smaller group of listeners before rolling out the format more broadly. All HiFi Plus subscribers are expected to get access to the new format by August.
If you're an EAP member, you can access the new hi-res lossless content by updating your beta app and selecting "Max" quality in the new Audio & Playback settings screen.
Audio / Video Bluetooth, the technology that powers the wireless data connections between billions of devices, is going to become even more capable, with big increases planned for the data bandwidth of Bluetooth LE.
The Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) -- the organization that's responsible for the ongoing development of Bluetooth technology -- organized a media briefing via Vimeo on May 2, 2023, to outline the changes.
Audio / Video I recently spent some time auditioning the Sonos Era 300, both as a standalone speaker and in its stereo-pair and full home theater configurations. The Era 300 is the first wireless speaker built specifically to make the playback of spatial audio formats — like Dolby Atmos Music — sound their best.
And there's no question about it -- the Era 300 rocks.
