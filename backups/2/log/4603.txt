Tesla Tesla has finally revealed the delivery date for the Cybertruck: November 30.
The automaker led by Elon Musk announced the date in a post on X.
 The event will take place at Tesla’s Cybertruck Gigafactory in Austin, Texas.
The announcement follows Musk’s promise in April that the delivery event would take place in the third quarter, but that came and went without an update.
Tesla says Cybertruck resellers could face harsh penalties Watch your back, Tesla. Volvo’s EX30 just raised the bar on EV value Toyota joins ‘the Tesla plug’ club If previous Tesla launches are anything to go by, the long-awaited event at the end of next month will likely involve a party-like atmosphere with Musk handing the first Cybertrucks to the initial customers. You never know, the CEO might even pull a few dance moves, too.
The new Cybertruck owners should also receive a medal for exhibiting an impressive level of patience, as they’re likely to have been among the first to have pre-ordered the futuristic-looking, all-electric pickup when it was unveiled four years ago.
As of this summer, almost 2 million orders had reportedly come in for the Cybertruck, with each customer putting down a $100 refundable deposit. But it’ll be a while yet before they’re all delivered after Musk said during a Tesla earnings call on Wednesday that getting production to capacity anytime soon faces challenges. The Tesla chief said the automaker is targeting output of around 250,000 Cybertrucks a year, but added that it’s unlikely to happen until after 2024.
Wednesday’s delivery announcement has been a long time coming. The Cybertruck’s development has faced various delays along the way, causing it to miss its original 2021 target date. That’s allowed rival automakers to play catch-up, with firms like Ford and Rivian launching their own electric pickups in the meantime.
Tesla will be hoping that the Cybertruck’s unique design will help make a success of the vehicle, though a couple of years ago Musk admitted that there’s “some chance that Cybertruck will flop.” More recently, however, the Tesla boss sounded a more positive note, saying in August that he believes the Cybertruck is “our best product ever.” Editors' Recommendations Tesla U-turns on controversial rule for Cybertruck resellers Lucid joins other automakers by adopting Tesla charging plug Watch how Tesla’s Cybertruck handles a compound bow’s arrow Tesla Model 3 Highland: release date, range, design update, and more Volkswagen ID.4 vs Tesla Model Y Tech News Tesla Cars Electric vehicles benefit from instant torque, but that doesn't necessarily mean they're quick.
The more affordable electric cars, like the Chevrolet Bolt EV and Hyundai Kona Electric, are zippy around town, but nothing to brag about on a drag strip. However, higher-end models like the ones we're looking at here can keep up with some of the most powerful gasoline-burning sports cars in the world -- and in many cases beat them.
Cars The Rivian R1T electric pickup truck now gets 410 miles of range with the new Max Pack battery and Dual-Motor powertrain, the company claims.
Rivian posted range estimates for the Max Pack, which is not available with Rivian's Quad-Motor powertrain, on X (formerly known as Twitter) on Wednesday, but those haven't been confirmed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The 410-mile range estimate applies to trucks with 21-inch wheels. Opting for 22-inch wheels knocks the estimated range down to 380 miles. The available 20-inch wheel and all-terrain tire combination — which helps maximize the R1T's impressive off-road capability — brings a further range reduction, to 355 miles.
Cars Aside from building electric cars, batteries, and solar panels, Tesla is also looking to build a Supercharger station with a difference.
The automaker has reportedly received planning permission to construct an all-night diner and drive-in movie theater in Los Angeles, Teslarati reported recently.
