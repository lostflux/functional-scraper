Why trust us? The best Final Fantasy games, ranked from best to worst By Jesse Lennox Close While the role-playing game (RPG) has become a catch-all genre, now encompassing an almost silly range of games that don’t share much in common, there was one video game franchise in the 1980s that was the quintessential RPG. Yes, we’re talking about Final Fantasy from Square Enix.
The fantasy Japanese RPGs debuted on the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) in 1987, but they became cultural touchstones in the ’90s as Super Nintendo games.
 From there, the series made an incredibly successful jump to 3D on the PlayStation 1 before the mainline series started to take more risks, including the elimination of turn-based battles and massively multiplayer online game (MMO) entries, and the latest game, Final Fantasy XVI , becoming a full-on character-action game.
If you’re just getting into Final Fantasy , though, where do you start? Most Final Fantasy games are at the very least good, while many are great — and others are masterpieces which is why we decided to rank all of the best Final Fantasy games.

Other entries have been fully real-time before, but never quite as action-oriented as this. With staff consisting of those who previously worked on character-action games, specifically, Devil May Cry, Final Fantasy XVI plays like no other entry in the series and is far lighter on the typical JRPG mechanics most would expect. While that is a matter of taste, the story is a bit more of a mixed bag. It has great potential, and a very strong opening, but fails to maintain that level of quality and intrigue for its entire duration.
 Still, as an entry point to the series, or for those who want a fantasy game that is more active than other entries, this is a satisfying title to get engrossed in.

RPGs Baldur's Gate 3 Gaming Bethesda is one of the rare cases of a game developer finding so much success that it branched out to become one of the biggest publishers in the Western gaming market. While not quite as gigantic as the likes of Activision or EA, Bethesda has a great stable of developers, itself included, that have made some of the most ambitious games on the market. Whether it's the cutting-edge technology coming out of ID Software, the high-octane FPS action of Machine Games, or even the more experimental titles from Arkane, Bethesda's name is attached to far more than just its high-profile RPG series.
Since it was acquired by Microsoft, all of Bethesda's games, including the games made by the studios under it, will be console-exclusive to the X-box platform moving forward. However, there is a long history of games already released for multiple platforms, and between all the studios Bethesda is in charge of, there are games of all types to check out. You will obviously know the major players here, such as The Elder Scrolls and Fallout, but there are way more Bethesda games that are just as good. That's why we've rounded up this list of the best Bethesda games of all time.
Gaming After an uneven console cycle with the Xbox One, Microsoft's latest consoles are aimed at getting the ship back on course. The Xbox Series X is a next-generation powerhouse that rivals gaming PCs, while the Xbox Series S is an affordable stopgap for those who are curious about trying new games.
There's no shortage of games to play on either console thanks to Xbox Game Pass, which gives players immediate access to a library of titles old and new. That built-in catalog is an extra value on top of all the new games available on the system that take advantage of its impressive technical specs. When it comes to first-party exclusives, the Series X is still growing. Halo Infinite and Forza Horizon 5 gave a good boost to the console's library following a somewhat sparse first year. More games are also on the way. Microsoft's Bethesda acquisition will bring exclusives like Starfield and the potential addition of all Activision Blizzard games would further bolster that list, but the console's real strength lies in third-party support.
