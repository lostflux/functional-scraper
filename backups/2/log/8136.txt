Like any meteor shower , the Leonids offer a great opportunity to witness dramatic bright lights streaking across the sky as dust particles from a comet — in this case, Tempel-Tuttle — collide with Earth’s atmosphere.
Your best chance of seeing the so-called “shooting stars” is on Friday night or early Saturday morning, and EarthSky predicts that under a dark sky, you may be able to see up to 15 meteors an hour burning up in the atmosphere. If you’re busy doing other things this weekend, you can also look out for the Leonids every night until December 2.
How to watch the Orionid meteor shower tonight, in person or online How to watch the 2023 Perseid meteor shower this weekend How to watch the Geminids Meteor shower this month “Leonids tend to be bright, with many producing long trains that persist for a few seconds after the initial flash of light,” NASA says. And you don’t need to direct your gaze at any particular part of the sky for the Leonids. Just look straight up and wait for a streak of light to catch your eye.
So long as you have a cloudless or mostly cloudless sky, the best way to view a meteor shower is to find a location well away from any light pollution such as city lights.
To give yourself the best chance of witnessing as many meteor burn-ups as possible, try to find a viewing spot with a broad view of the sky, in other words, unobscured by things like trees, buildings, and mountains.
If you’re planning to stay outside for a while, be sure to wear warm clothing, and also take your blankets, hot drinks, and snacks so that you’ll feel nice and comfortable during what will hopefully be a memorable light show.
Also, to save yourself from straining your neck and spending the next few days walking around like Frankenstein, take a chair with a portable reclining seat if you happen to have one, or, failing that, something warm to lie on so that you can look straight up with ease.
Finally, if you don’t fancy heading out into the cold, or if there’s too much cloud cover where you are, then try the live stream (top) of Japan’s Subaru Telescope located at Mauna Kea in Hawaii.
Editors' Recommendations NASA’s skywatching tips for November include a meteor shower How to watch the Crew-6 astronauts return to Earth this weekend How to watch the Quadrantids meteor shower this week How to watch the spectacular Leonid meteor shower tonight How to watch the Orionid meteor shower this month Tech News Space This weekend is the peak of the yearly Perseids meteor shower, and if you're lucky, you might be able to spot a flurry of shooting stars overhead. Views will be hampered, however, by a full moon which unfortunately coincides with the event and which will make the shower harder to see.
The shower was in full swing yesterday evening between Friday, August 12, and Saturday, August 13, and despite the issue of the moon's brightness, there were still some stunning photographs captured from around the world. Tonight you'll have another chance to see the shower, and it will continue throughout this week but will gradually tail off -- so the sooner you can catch it, the better.
Space If you’re an early riser with a spot of free time to look up in the sky, then tomorrow morning you have a good chance to enjoy the Arietids meteor shower.
Meteor showers occur when Earth, during its orbit around the sun, passes through the trail of debris left by a comet. When this happens, the particles create a light show as they burn up in Earth’s atmosphere.
Space This Memorial Day weekend there's a chance you could view a special astronomical event: A never-before-seen meteor shower called the Tau Herculids.
The new meteor shower could be visible on the night of May 30 into May 31 in North America, which is an exciting possibility. However, it's hard to predict if meteors will actually be visible or not, as it is what NASA calls a "hit or miss" event.
