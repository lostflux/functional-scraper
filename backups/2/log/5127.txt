Among the most important things to consider for your purchase are size, resolution, and refresh rate — and of course, if the price fits your budget. There’s no shortage of options that you can find online from the different retailers, but you help you make a decision quickly, we’ve gathered our top picks below.

A 165Hz refresh rate is just above our computer monitor buying guide’s recommended range of 120Hz to 144Hz, and it’s great for gamers on a budget as you’ll still be getting proper support for your video games’ higher frame rates. Size and resolution are other factors to consider though, so you should be going for the monitor that your budget allows.

Best 360Hz gaming monitor Black Friday deals Lenovo If you’re willing to splurge on monitor deals for your gaming setup, and your computer runs on a powerful graphics card, then you should go for a display with a 360Hz refresh rate for the best possible gaming experience.

For those who have older TVs and monitors that run 1080p, the Xbox Series S is a budget-friendly way for folks to play the latest games. And sure, it might not be able to hit 4k and high resolutions, but so many console games are locked to 60hz and sometimes struggle with 4k graphics, so the Xbox Series S is doing quite well overall. Luckily, there are many great Black Friday deals you can grab for the Xbox Series S, especially if you're looking for a game or accessory. Chief among them Black Friday Series X deals, too.
Best Xbox Series S Black Friday Deals Unfortunately, there aren't a lot of deals available for the Xbox Series S right now, which is surprising given how close we're getting to Black Friday and all the other deals we've been seeing. Even so, there is a deal where you can get Xbox Game Pass Ultimate for free, so that's worth picking up if you plan to buy the Xbox Series S. There are some more Black Friday PS5 deals out there if you're willing to switch consoles (or want both in your arsenal).
Gaming The Black Friday and Cyber Week deals have dropped, earlier than ever this year it seems. Retailers are ready to get this thing started, but that's good news for you -- all of us, really -- because the competition means we're going to see some fantastically-low prices this year. While everyone else is shopping the best Black Friday deals for TVs, computers, smart home goods, and more, some of us are on the lookout for great gaming console deals, specifically on the Nintendo Switch. If that's you, listen up, because we've scoured the shopping world for some truly amazing Nintendo Switch Black Friday deals, some you can even shop as early as today. We've found deals on the console itself, including bundles, popular games, and even some accessories. So, put down that gamepad, kick up your feet, and let's get ready to grind out some levels.
The best Nintendo Switch Black Friday deals Computing If you're planning to get a new gaming laptop or other gaming accessories, you should check out the Black Friday deals on Razer products. It's one of the most popular brands among gamers because of its high-performance and stylish devices, and for the shopping holiday, you can get them with huge discounts. You're going to have to hurry with your chosen purchases once you've decided what to buy though, because stocks for some of these bargains may already be running low. If you're not set on Razer, be sure to shop the rest of Black Friday laptop deals and Black Friday gaming laptop deals to compare prices.
