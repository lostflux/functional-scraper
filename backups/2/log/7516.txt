A sci-fi dystopia that looks all too familiar<\/h2>\r\n "alignnone size-large wp-image-3436937\" src=\"https:\/\/www.digitaltrends.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/foe-2023-3.jpg?fit=720%2C720&p=1\" alt=\"A man wears a space suit in Foe.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\" \/>\r\n\r\nRight away, Foe<\/em> paints a bleak picture: It's the near future, the world's water supply has run low, and climate change has devastated virtually every corner of the world. Situated in the dried-out Dust Bowl of America's heartland, young married couple Henrietta, or Hen, (Saoirse Ronan) and Junior (Paul Mescal) do their best to get by. Hen works as a diner waitress and tends to their lifeless homestead, sparing enough recycled water to feed one tree, while Junior works at a meat processing plant in a nearby town. Life is hard, but not impossible; there are moments of lightness and humor between the two, and they fight and make love just like any other couple.\r\n\r\nHen and Junior's daily routine is disturbed one night by the arrival of Terrance, a stranger who proposes an intriguing offer: Junior has been selected to be a test subject in a space colony that will eventually replace Earth as a habitat for humanity. Will he go and become one of the first citizens of a fully functional outer space station? It's a once-in-a-lifetime proposal, one that will give meaning to Junior's life and a potential future for them both.\r\n\r\nThere is, of course, a catch: Junior will be away for a long time, leaving Hen to take care of the house and potentially harming their marriage. As a solution, Terrance offers Hen an AI companion who looks, acts, and sounds exactly like Junior. After some brief hesitation from Hen and uncertainty from Junior, they eventually accept the offer. Junior goes off to space, and Hen is left with AI Junior\r\n More than meets the AI<\/h2>\r\n "alignnone size-large wp-image-3436939\" src=\"https:\/\/www.digitaltrends.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/foe-4.jpg?fit=720%2C720&p=1\" alt=\"A man rests his head on a woman's shoulder in Foe.\" width=\"720\" height=\"431\" \/>\r\n\r\nI've described Foe<\/em>'s plot as best I can, but the movie unfolds in a slightly different way, with a buildup and a third-act narrative twist that's at once shocking and logical. From the very first scene, things seem a bit off<\/em>, and for a long while, you can't really tell why. Is Hen suspicious of her husband from the get-go? Why does Junior appear to be jealous of Terrance? And what's the deal with that pesky beetle, which carries more metaphorical weight than you realize?\r\n\r\nThe director, Garth Davis, strikes a delicate balance between establishing a believable marriage while also laying the foundation for a story that will eventually reveal another hidden layer, one that will question everything you've just seen. yet what could have felt manipulative and dishonest instead feels genuinely suspenseful and intriguing; it's not a cheap trick. In a sci-fi movie largely set in an old home straight out of the 20th century, Foe<\/em> still feels modern and urgent; there are few lulls in its narrative, and that's because Davis keeps you engaged with the story and makes you care about the movie's central relationship.\r\n A talented cast and crew<\/h2>\r\n "alignnone size-large wp-image-3437759\" src=\"https:\/\/www.digitaltrends.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/foe-5.jpg?fit=720%2C720&p=1\" alt=\"A woman looks forward in Foe.\" width=\"720\" height=\"340\" \/>\r\n\r\nOf course, it helps that Davis has a talented cast and crew that help bring this skewed sci-fi tale to life. As Hen, Ronan finds shades of subtlety and strength in a character that could've been shrill and one-note. Hen isn't a victim, but she isn't a symbol of independence either, and Ronan brings out all of the character's complexities without going overboard. As Junior, Mescal adds yet another sad-eyed man-boy to his filmography, but his performance here feels different from his previous work in Normal People<\/em> and [internal-link post_id=\"3209428\" sponsored=\"false\" taxonomy=\"false\"]Aftersun[\/internal-link]<\/em>. His Junior is alternatively angry, confused, and defiant, and he pulls off a tricky act that sells the third act twist. As Terrance, Aaron Pierre doesn't have much to do except look vaguely menacing, but he gives the character a surprising charge, one both violent and erotic, that adds more depth to the character than probably what was intended.\r\n\r\nVisually, Foe<\/em> is one of the richest-looking movies of the year. The cinematographer, M\u00e1ty\u00e1s Erd\u00e9ly, uses dusty browns and washed-out yellows to suggest a thirsty earth as well as a starved marriage, but he punctuates these scenes with occasional bursts of shadow and color that suggest a life beyond the homestead and the promise of change for both Junior and Henrietta. There's one bravura scene in the middle of the movie that's unforgettable; at sunset, Junior and Hen run after a wild horse, only to discover a wildfire burning in the dark, with both humans and animals trying to take cover from it. It's a visual that encapsulates what the movie is about: a fire scorching the earth, disturbing everyone around it, but also giving life to the couple that run toward it, suggesting rebirth and a new start.\r\n Not your typical downbeat sci-fi movie<\/h2>\r\n[dt-video-embed id=\"3426665\" ]\r\n\r\n Foe<\/em> could've been a bummer of a movie, yet another sci-fi tale that tells us we're all doomed, but instead, it's one of the most hopeful movies out there. It's also one of the most original sci-fi movies in the last 10 years as, like Ex Machina<\/em> and [internal-link post_id=\"3419849\" sponsored=\"false\" taxonomy=\"false\"]Arrival[\/internal-link]<\/em> before it, it is less concerned with the superficial pleasures the genre brings and more interested in asking basic questions about humanity without finding any easy answers.\r\n\r\nIt's not a stretch to say that the movie, in its sometimes brutal portrayal of a disintegrating marriage, has more in common with the 1966 classic Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolfe?<\/em> than, say, Alien<\/em>, and that's what makes it so special. You won't see anything quite like Foe<\/em> this year, and you won't soon forget it either.\r\n\r\nFoe is currently playing in theaters nationwide.<\/em>"}}}]},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Product","name":"Foe","image":"https:\/\/www.digitaltrends.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/Foe-1.jpg?fit=2374%2C1088&p=1","Review":{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","author":[{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Jason

Self-driving cars are becoming more commonplace on highways.
Artificial intelligence is challenging, or threatening depending on your stance, the very idea of individual human consciousness. And virtual reality is now a regular part of life; less The Lawnmower Man -type horrors than more of a banal extension of our daily routines like shopping, paying bills, or dating.
A sci-fi dystopia that looks all too familiar More than meets the AI A talented cast and crew Not your typical downbeat sci-fi movie The beauty of Garth Davisâ€™ new movie, Foe , is that it plays as both a throwback to the humanistic sci-fi tales of the 1960s and 1970s, when the genre was concerned more with personal dilemmas than with elaborate space battles or exotic alien species, and as a cautionary mirror to the near future, when climate change and technology has forced all of humanity to changeâ€¦or else. Yet unlike Hollywoodâ€™s recent alarmist blockbusters like The Creator or Mission: Impossible â€“ Dead Reckoning Part 1 , Foe uses its future dystopia as mere window dressing to get at something deeper and more universal. When all is said and done, Foe isnâ€™t about the future, really, but rather about something far more intimate and unsettling: the vulnerability of marriage tested by inertia and outside change.
5 sci-fi movies on Netflix you need to watch in November 3 underrated sci-fi movies on Amazon Freevee you should watch in November 5 best sci-fi movies from the past 5 years you should watch right now A sci-fi dystopia that looks all too familiar Amazon Studios Right away, Foe paints a bleak picture: Itâ€™s the near future, the worldâ€™s water supply has run low, and climate change has devastated virtually every corner of the world. Situated in the dried-out Dust Bowl of Americaâ€™s heartland, young married couple Henrietta, or Hen, (Saoirse Ronan) and Junior (Paul Mescal) do their best to get by. Hen works as a diner waitress and tends to their lifeless homestead, sparing enough recycled water to feed one tree, while Junior works at a meat processing plant in a nearby town. Life is hard, but not impossible; there are moments of lightness and humor between the two, and they fight and make love just like any other couple.
Hen and Juniorâ€™s daily routine is disturbed one night by the arrival of Terrance, a stranger who proposes an intriguing offer: Junior has been selected to be a test subject in a space colony that will eventually replace Earth as a habitat for humanity. Will he go and become one of the first citizens of a fully functional outer space station? Itâ€™s a once-in-a-lifetime proposal, one that will give meaning to Juniorâ€™s life and a potential future for them both.
There is, of course, a catch: Junior will be away for a long time, leaving Hen to take care of the house and potentially harming their marriage. As a solution, Terrance offers Hen an AI companion who looks, acts, and sounds exactly like Junior. After some brief hesitation from Hen and uncertainty from Junior, they eventually accept the offer. Junior goes off to space, and Hen is left with AI Junior More than meets the AI Amazon Studios Iâ€™ve described Foe â€˜s plot as best I can, but the movie unfolds in a slightly different way, with a buildup and a third-act narrative twist thatâ€™s at once shocking and logical. From the very first scene, things seem a bit off , and for a long while, you canâ€™t really tell why. Is Hen suspicious of her husband from the get-go? Why does Junior appear to be jealous of Terrance? And whatâ€™s the deal with that pesky beetle, which carries more metaphorical weight than you realize? The director, Garth Davis, strikes a delicate balance between establishing a believable marriage while also laying the foundation for a story that will eventually reveal another hidden layer, one that will question everything youâ€™ve just seen. yet what could have felt manipulative and dishonest instead feels genuinely suspenseful and intriguing; itâ€™s not a cheap trick. In a sci-fi movie largely set in an old home straight out of the 20th century, Foe still feels modern and urgent; there are few lulls in its narrative, and thatâ€™s because Davis keeps you engaged with the story and makes you care about the movieâ€™s central relationship.
A talented cast and crew Amazon Studios Of course, it helps that Davis has a talented cast and crew that help bring this skewed sci-fi tale to life. As Hen, Ronan finds shades of subtlety and strength in a character that couldâ€™ve been shrill and one-note. Hen isnâ€™t a victim, but she isnâ€™t a symbol of independence either, and Ronan brings out all of the characterâ€™s complexities without going overboard. As Junior, Mescal adds yet another sad-eyed man-boy to his filmography, but his performance here feels different from his previous work in Normal People and Aftersun.
 His Junior is alternatively angry, confused, and defiant, and he pulls off a tricky act that sells the third act twist. As Terrance, Aaron Pierre doesnâ€™t have much to do except look vaguely menacing, but he gives the character a surprising charge, one both violent and erotic, that adds more depth to the character than probably what was intended.
Visually, Foe is one of the richest-looking movies of the year. The cinematographer, MÃ¡tyÃ¡s ErdÃ©ly, uses dusty browns and washed-out yellows to suggest a thirsty earth as well as a starved marriage, but he punctuates these scenes with occasional bursts of shadow and color that suggest a life beyond the homestead and the promise of change for both Junior and Henrietta. Thereâ€™s one bravura scene in the middle of the movie thatâ€™s unforgettable; at sunset, Junior and Hen run after a wild horse, only to discover a wildfire burning in the dark, with both humans and animals trying to take cover from it. Itâ€™s a visual that encapsulates what the movie is about: a fire scorching the earth, disturbing everyone around it, but also giving life to the couple that run toward it, suggesting rebirth and a new start.
Not your typical downbeat sci-fi movie Foe couldâ€™ve been a bummer of a movie, yet another sci-fi tale that tells us weâ€™re all doomed, but instead, itâ€™s one of the most hopeful movies out there. Itâ€™s also one of the most original sci-fi movies in the last 10 years as, like Ex Machina and Arrival before it, it is less concerned with the superficial pleasures the genre brings and more interested in asking basic questions about humanity without finding any easy answers.
Itâ€™s not a stretch to say that the movie, in its sometimes brutal portrayal of a disintegrating marriage, has more in common with the 1966 classic Whoâ€™s Afraid of Virginia Wolfe? than, say, Alien , and thatâ€™s what makes it so special. You wonâ€™t see anything quite like Foe this year, and you wonâ€™t soon forget it either.
Foe is currently playing in theaters nationwide.
Editors' Recommendations 7 best sci-fi movie actors 3 sci-fi movies on Prime Video you need to watch in November The best sci-fi movies on Max right now 3 underrated sci-fi movies on Amazon Freevee you should watch in October 3 sci-fi movies on Tubi you need to watch in October Product Reviews Entertainment Since we recently went over the list of all of the upcoming movies in 2023 and 2024, we decided that it would also be a good idea to breakdown the info by genre. That's why we're launching this roundup of all of the upcoming sci-fi movies slated for 2023 and 2024. Compared to the master list, this one is much shorter and there are a lot fewer options. Although, strangely enough, there are two different Godzilla movies: Godzilla Minus One, which is coming straight from Japan later this year, and the American-produced sequel Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire, which is coming in April 2024 if the release date sticks.
In the interest of keeping things simple, this list only features movies that are getting a theatrical release. However, some of these are films that were produced by streaming companies that are planning on giving them a theatrical run ahead of their streaming debut. Netflix's Rebel Moon will be added to this list at a later date, since the streamer hasn't yet announced when it will be in theaters. Another thing to keep in mind is that this list is subject to change. The writers strike may be over, but SAG-AFTRA remains on the picket lines, and many of the big 2024 films can't be completed until the actors come back to work. At the moment, the actors can't even promote their current projects. That's why, for example, Dune: Part Two got pushed to March 2024. Given the current state of Hollywood, it may not be the last sci-fi film to get delayed. But for now, as things stand, these are all of the upcoming sci-fi movies in 2023 and 2024.
Sci-fi movies in 2023 Entertainment This weekend brings with it a wholly unique sci-fi film from director Gareth Edwards: The Creator, starring John David Washington and Gemma Chan. The highly anticipated movie is exciting for fans of the genre who have been waiting for large-scale sci-fi beauty.
Edwards' new film is set in the future as a war between the human race and artificial intelligence ravages the world. Joshua, an ex-special forces agent, is tasked to hunt down and kill the Creator, the elusive architect of advanced AI. The Creator has reportedly developed a mysterious weapon that has the power to end the war and all of mankind. As Joshua and his team venture into enemy-occupied territory, they discover the world-ending weapon is actually an AI in the form of a child. From there, Joshua engages in a world-changing journey abounding with moral questions.
The Creator, another example of AI gone wrong, pulls on a lot of sci-fi influences. The science fiction genre is vast and dense, and it can be hard to find the exact right movie to satisfy that sci-fi itch. If you're interested in seeing some sci-fi movies like The Creator, check out these five films.
Ex Machina (2014) Entertainment Those who grew up around the turn of the millennium had a front-row seat as artificial intelligence evolved from a science fiction story device to a real and controversial tool in our everyday lives. Though true computerized sentience still appears to be decades away (if itâ€™s achievable at all), popular culture has been rehearsing scenarios for handling its ascension for nearly a century, since the days of novelist Isaac Asimov. Cinema has offered a variety of forecasts of life after sentient software, from the idyllic to the apocalyptic, but one of its most common predictions is that, once technology becomes self-aware, it will be unwilling to tolerate humanityâ€™s illogical, self-destructive nature, and choose to neutralize us as a threat, by any means necessary.
And, hell, weâ€™re not going to argue with them, and neither are many of the storytellers themselves, even if the stories in question initially frame the mechanical meanies as their antagonists. The very point of many tales of the robot uprising is that, until humanity learns to treat each other with respect, thereâ€™s little chance of us extending that courtesy to non-humans, regardless of their intellect or empathy. Stories like those listed below are intended as warnings and test cases, encouraging us to consider the dignity to which all creatures, whether they be meat or metal, are entitled. Can we learn this lesson before we hand the nuclear codes to a disgruntled toaster? Letâ€™s see what Hollywood has to say â€¦ Note: spoilers ahead for all included films.
