Why trust us? T-Mobile celebrates 1 million 5G home internet customers By Peter Hunt Szpytek Close Following the commercial launch of its at-home internet services in April 2021, T-Mobile is celebrating its 1-millionth home internet customer just one year later. The company’s stated goals when launching the service were to bring the fast internet speeds of its 5G mobile plans to home routers, and its been widely successful. On top of its 1 million customers, T-Mobile boasts that an additional 10 million households in the U.S. are eligible for its 5G home internet plan as well.
While the company is taking a moment to celebrate the major milestone, it recognizes that there’s still much more work to be done before all Americans are connected via 5G.
 T-Mobile points out that over 40 million U.S. citizens still don’t have access to high-speed home connections and a significant portion that do only have one service provider as an option. T-Mobile aims to be another choice for those feeling like they’re out of luck when it comes to home internet.
There’s more Un-carrier disruption on the way.
Have an Android phone? You can get unlimited 5G service for free How fast is 5G? What you need to know about 5G speeds The 5G speed race is over and T-Mobile has won T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert said that the speedy growth of the company’s Un-carrier home internet plan showcases just “how hungry” customers are for new carriers that provide alternative options from the ISPs that have dominated the industry previously. He also says that there’s “more Un-carrier disruption on the way” as the company continues its plans to shake up the home internet market.
After the year of success its seen, T-Mobile’s current goals aren’t small ones as it aims to have “7 million to 8 million fixed wireless customers by 2025.” The company has been one of the fastest-growing mobile networks over the past several years and if it’s able to hit its home internet goals, it could continue its hot streak.
T-Mobile keeps things relatively cheap with its 5G home internet plan costing just $50 per month, making it a pretty good deal when compared to other ISPs.
 Its marketing also claims that it can be up and running in eligible houses in just 15 minutes, making it a painless “install” that’s accessible for just about everyone.
Editors' Recommendations This new MediaTek chip is about to bring 5G to a lot more devices T-Mobile still has the fastest 5G, but its rivals are catching up T-Mobile’s huge lead in 5G speeds isn’t going anywhere Don’t buy the Pixel Tablet; get this cheaper Android tablet instead Netgear’s new M6 Pro router lets you use fast 5G anywhere you go 5G Cellular Carriers T-Mobile Tech News Mobile The budget smartphone market is a bustling space right now, with great phones from Nokia and Samsung making big waves. Motorola is the unofficial king of the budget smartphone, but its throne is looking quite shaky right now. That might be why it's decided to remix some classics this year, releasing new versions of the Moto G 5G and Moto G Stylus.
While there are definitely some improvements in the 2023 versions of both phones, Motorola has also made some cutbacks for both, making these new versions remixes of past classics rather than pure upgrades. Here's everything you need to know about the Motorola Moto G 5G (2023) and Moto G Stylus (2023).
Moto G 5G (2023) Mobile Verizon plans to expand its faster 5G Ultra Wideband network to reach beyond urban and suburban centers later this year, helping to drive up performance for folks in rural areas and spearhead the growth of its fixed wireless access (FWA) broadband services.
Verizon CEO Hans Vestburg touched on these details this week in the company’s quarterly earnings call, where he lauded the rapid expansion of the carrier’s C-band coverage to reach 200 million people in just over a year “since we lit up the first site.” Mobile T-Mobile has just unveiled a new set of plans and perks to help both new and current customers break free of lengthy device contracts while guaranteeing you'll be able to get the best deals available on phone upgrades every two years.
Significantly, with the new plans, the "Un-carrier" promises equal treatment for all customers, whether they're coming over from another carrier or have been using T-Mobile's services for years. That's in contrast to the limited-time offers of its rivals, which often ignore their most loyal subscribers in an effort to entice others to switch carriers.
