Why trust us? Best AirPods Max accessories for 2023: cases, stands, and more By Derek Malcolm Close Apple's excellent headphones, the AirPods Max, are one of the best pairs of noise-canceling headphones money can buy. Well, there are a few other headphones we'd recommend, but with their beautiful design, industry-leading active noise cancelation(ANC) and transparency mode, the AirPods Max are pretty hard to beat. And if you're going to spend the substantial $550 price for them, you might as well trick them out with some AirPods Max accessories.
Why not protect them with cool earcup covers or a sturdy carrying case, or some fun and stylish solutions for charging them at home or on the go? To help with that, we've put together this roundup of the best AirPods Max accessories.
If you're more of a wireless earbuds kind of person, we've also got a roundup of the best accessories for AirPods and AirPods Pro , too.
More More UAG UAG Ration Protective Case for the AirPods Max Best overall AirPods Max case Built with quality materials Interior strap Mesh pouch for cables Activates low-power mode On the pricey side Of all the AirPods Max cases we've seen, the Urban Armor Gear (UAG) Ration case just feels like a step above the rest, which it most certainly should for its $80 price tag. The exterior "ballistic nylon" material feels like a thick and durable cover for the hard case beneath. UAG states that the case is "weather resistant," which doesn't mean your precious AirPods Max will be safe from anything serious like submersion, but combined with a pretty sturdy rubber lining along the zipper to help seal it up, you've got some substantial protection from spills, splashes, and more.
On the inside, the Ration Protective Case is compression molded to fit the AirPods Max perfectly, whether they're in their smart case or not, and a little magnetic butterfly divider makes contact with the headphones to put them into low power mode when not in use to help preserve battery power. A helpful elastic strap that runs across the headphones seems like a small thing, but it helps the AirPods Max stay put, while a mesh pouch on the inside of the case's lid is lined with memory foam and is perfect for storing charging cables and other small attachments like adapter cables. On the outside, there's a carrying handle and carabiner for hooking it to a backpack.
More Image used with permission by copyright holder co2CREA Hard Case for AirPods Max Best more affordable AirPods Max case Comes in a variety of colors Internal compartment for charger and cable Affordable Activates low-power mode No internal pouch For starters, the velvety-soft plush interior material just feels so good that you want to pet it, and the extra space inside for your cable and charging brick is a little touch even our No. 1 pick above doesn't offer — and it's $40 cheaper. Sure, it doesn't feel as rugged as some other cases, but the EVA polymer (read: plastic) shell is sturdy enough to protect your AirPods Max well, plus it's got a strong zipper that seals things up nicely. There's no IP water-resistance rating here, and you'd be hard-pressed to find a case that offers it, but your headphones should be safe against the odd splash.
The coCREA Hard Case's compact design fits nicely in any bag or backpack and, perhaps most importantly, it features the magnetic butterfly tabs to put the AirPods Max into low power mode, whether they're in their Smart Case or not. It's a great value with many of the features of our favorite overall pick.
Image used with permission by copyright holder Spigen Urban Fit Ear Cup Covers for AirPods Max Best ear cup covers for AirPods Max Stylish, grippy, fabric material No interference with controls Easy to snap on and off They cover up the AirPods Max's looks Apple makes some pretty sick-looking devices — the iPhone is the prime example. Yet for how beautifully designed they are, it's common practice to cover them up with a protective case or skin to prevent disaster. The AirPods Max are no different. Spigen, reputable makers of all manner of cases, chargers, and accessories for smartphones, tablets, smartwatches, and more, haven't left the AirPods Max unnoticed with the Urban Fit ear cup cover. A firm, protective polycarbonate shell sits under a woven fabric covering that feels good to the touch and is grippy for those with butterfingers. While it does cover up the color of the AirPods underneath, the black or gray options offer a sophisticated look as well, and the protection will be worth it.
Molded to fit without interfering with the crown dial or buttons on the AirPods Max's earcup, the Urban covers snap on and off easily and aren't bulky. They also don't interfere with the Smart Case, and the $30 price is well worth it. That said, if you prefer to see your slick AirPods Max's color, Spigen also has the transparent Ultra Hybrid Pro covers.
Image used with permission by copyright holder Superone Headphone Stand for AirPods Max Best AirPods Max stand with low power mode Durable one-pice aluminum design Rubber footings so it won't slide Puts AirPods in low-power mode No charging pad for other devices Sure, there are a lot of stands out there that have built-in wireless charging pads for iPhones, AirPods cases, and Apple Watch, but most of them just have the AirPods Max dangling on a post like a piece of meat. I'm kidding; they can look cool, too.
 But, we like this lesser-known option from Superone, as it's made from one solid piece of aluminum; has a weighted, grippy base so it doesn't slide around on your desk; and it's lined with a soft, plush material that won't scratch your AirPods. Most people are going to like this stand because it's one of the few on the market that puts the AirPods Max into low-power mode when the headphones are inserted, which helps preserve the AirPods' battery life.
The molded plush cradle only fits AirPods Max, but they do so perfectly. Additionally, when cradled, the Lightning power port is exposed, so you can easily charge them while they're docked. The only drawback is the aforementioned lack of additional wireless charging features for your other devices.
Derek Malcolm/Digital Trends Case-Mate Fuel 30-watt USB-C Wall Charger Compact multi-device fast charger Compact design Fun translucent colors Plug ends fold up 30-watt fast charging Doesn't come with cable The AirPods Max don't come with a charging adapter, so you're left to grab one on your own. So why not get one with some style? These 30-watt little bricks from Case-Mate are cute, powerful, and will deliver a fast charge to your AirPods Max and other devices like smartphones and tablets, all while fitting easily in your pocket, purse, or even inside your AirPods Max case, should you have one, with its foldable prongs.
The Case-Mate Fuel charger comes with built-in smart GaN technology that keeps heat to a minimum and optimizes charging output.
Available in four fun colors — Vibrant Orange, Electric Blue, Vivid Green, and Frosted White — the Fuel comes with a one-year warranty.
