Read on to find out more about how to use Microsoft Teams.
Image used with permission by copyright holder What is Microsoft Teams? Created by Microsoft as a collaboration app, Teams combines the best features from Microsoft Classroom and Skype for Business to create a program capable of file storage, app integration, videoconferencing, instant messaging, VoIP calling, and granular organization of team and collaborators.
Teams has more than 270 million users around the world and is the most popular collaboration app with businesses. However, it's not only a business app. More than 1 million people use Teams as their primary messaging app as well.
The app itself is packed with functionality. For starters, people can silo different parts of their lives into independent Teams. For example, a person could have personal chats and work chats independent of each other. These are the nuts and bolts of Microsoft Teams.
Each Team has one-on-one chats (called Chats), group chats (called Teams Channels), file sharing, group whiteboards, and video calling with up to 100 people. There's also the ability to schedule events directly in the app so everybody involved receives it in their calendars, and users can set reminders in the app.
Finally, there's the ability to customize profile pictures for both individuals and entire groups, and users can set their availability status directly in the app so others know if they're around or not.
Image used with permission by copyright holder How to install Microsoft Teams on PC Microsoft Teams is free to use. However, if you want to unlock full functionality with seamless syncing between OneDrive, Calendar, To Do, and other Microsoft apps, you'll want a Microsoft 365 account. For mobile devices, simply head to the App Store, search for " Microsoft Teams ," and install the app.
Most modern Windows PCs come with Teams pre-installed. However, if your computer doesn't have it, the process is straightforward.
Step 1: Download Teams from Microsoft.
Step 2: Run the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the application.

Image used with permission by copyright holder How to set up Teams for individuals Teams is a fantastic communication tool for everyday use. Not only can you make video calls with your loved ones, but you can also text them via SMS directly from Teams! Setting it up is straightforward and should only take a minute or two.
Step 1: In Windows, open the Start menu and select Teams.
 On Mac, open the Launchpad and click on Teams.
Step 2: Sign in with your Microsoft account.
Image used with permission by copyright holder How to set up Teams for organizations Businesses and organizations can set up Teams just as easily as individuals. The difference is that the organization will need to invite members to join its Team. This process is simple enough, but each person on the team will need to install and set up Teams on their end.
Organizations will also need an active Microsoft 365 Business or Enterprise subscription to work, and they'll need a valid domain name. Another thing to note is the full Business or Enterprise versions of Teams are not available for academic institutions.
Once all team members have Teams installed, setting up Teams for everybody to use is simple. Here's how: Step 1: Open Teams from the Start menu or Launchpad (on Mac).
Step 2: Select Sign up for Teams.

Image used with permission by copyright holder How to chat in Teams Chatting is arguably Teams' strongest suit. Whether as an individual user or as part of an organization, chats keep you connected.
Microsoft Teams has the same chatting capabilities you would expect to find in other chat apps such as WhatsApp and iMessage. It is also a strong competitor to Slack when it comes to team-based chats. You'll find the app fairly straightforward to use.
Step 1: Select Chat from the left-side menu bar.
Step 2: Select New Chat from the little box with a pen above it. You'll find this in the Chat window to the right of the menu bar.

Image used with permission by copyright holder How to use Channels in Teams Channels are sections of your Team where you can keep everything organized by subject, projects, etc. However, they are called Teams, not Channels. Yet when it comes to usage, Microsoft calls them Channels, and the overall organization is the "Team." It's confusing, we know.
Channels (or Teams) are big group chats where entire teams of people (there it is again) can message each other, share files, join video conferences, and more. Admins can set roles within the team, such as Team Owner and Team Member. They can also designate moderators to manage content on the channel ... err, team.

Step 5: Select Create Team to finish the process.

How to make video calls in Teams Teams allows you to make one-on-one video calls or conduct group video calls with up to 100 participants. Everyone can chat, share files, and work on a whiteboard during these calls.

Hereâ€™s how Microsoft Surface Pro 7+ with Type Cover price slashed by $330 â€˜Compact Modeâ€™ canâ€™t fix the Xbox app. Hereâ€™s what could Business Communication Software How-To Guides Microsoft Microsoft Teams Deals The titular office suite, and one that just about everyone knows, called Microsoft Office, includes the renowned word processor Microsoft Word. But with the recent versions of its software, Microsoft has migrated to the cloud. Microsoft Word is a versatile and capable word processor that's essential for typing and editing written documents, among other things (and there are a lot of things you probably didn't know you could do in Microsoft Word). Microsoft Office is paid software, however, Word is included, and for some, the cost may seem high even with some of the best Microsoft Office deals floating around. So, if you're wondering if there's a Microsoft Word free trial or any other way to get it for free, read on to find out.
Is there a Microsoft Word free trial? Microsoft Word is actually part of the company's wider Office app suite. Now known simply as Microsoft 365 (formerly Microsoft Office), Microsoft's enterprise software is available in a number of different packages that are now subscription-based; the company has retired the older bundles that were available for a one-time payment. That means if you want a Microsoft Word free trial, you'll need to sign up for the Microsoft 365 trial, which includes the Word app along with Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Teams, OneDrive, and Editor.

Computing During Apple's "Scary Fast" event, one feature caught my eye unlike anything else: Dynamic Caching. Probably like most people watching the presentation, I had one reaction: "How does memory allocation increase performance?" Apple based its debut of the new M3 chip around a "cornerstone" feature it calls Dynamic Caching for the GPU. Apple's simplified explanation doesn't make it clear exactly what Dynamic Caching does, much less how it improves performance of the GPU on the M3.
