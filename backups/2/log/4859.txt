Why trust us? Best router Black Friday deals on mesh networks and Wi-Fi 6 routers By Albert Bassili Close Even if your router is only four or five years old, it might be time for an upgrade, given the recent advances in router tech, such as Wi-Fi 6 , which has become much more prominent. The same also applies to mesh routers, which have more advanced technology that can handle multiple connected devices, such as smart lights, home security systems, phones, and so forth. Of course, you don’t have to pay a lot of money to grab yourself a new router, and there are even some great Black Friday deals you can take advantage of that will save you a little bit of extra cash. We’ve collected some of our favorite deals on routers below, but be sure to check back regularly as we update with newer and better deals.
Best Router Black Friday Deals Best Mesh Router Black Friday Deals Best Router Black Friday Deals TP-Link Routers are a great option if you don’t have a large home or need to cover a lot of square footage, and putting them near you means that you get much better speeds and lower latency when connecting through Wi-Fi. Of course, that may not always be an option, so it’s important to know what sort of capacity and speeds routers can do. Most routers will have an “AX” followed by a set of numbers that dictates the maximum speed it can reach, and the rule of thumb is generally that this maximum speed only applies when you’re really close to the router, so the further out you go, the less speed you’ll get. It’s not perfect, but generally more powerful routers that can hit higher speeds will be able to connect at higher speeds further away, although its always best to check the actual real-world performance of a router before taking the plunge.

They can help a lot with things such as Wi-Fi dead spots, and most of them are very modular and can have several base stations, so you don’t have to stick to the two or three that come in a pack. However, again, you should always check how much a system can support before taking the plunge.
