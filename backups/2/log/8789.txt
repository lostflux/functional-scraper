The Walt Disney Company, which already owns the other two-thirds of Hulu thanks to its 2019 purchase of 20th Century Fox, made an announcement today that updates the timeline for its acquisition. In the statement, Disney said it expects to pay Comcast Corp.’s NBC Universal approximately $8.61 billion. The purchase amount is to be based on an appraisal of Hulu’s value conducted on September 30, 2023.
The agreement, which was struck in 2019, was based on Hulu’s then-appraised fair value of $27.5 billion. Though the wheels on this deal will be set in motion on December 1, 2023, the ink isn’t expected to dry until sometime in early 2024.
The hidden costs of buying a 4K TV are way higher than you think Sony’s Bravia Core gets a new name, and new PS4/PS5 apps Disney+, Hulu, ESPN+ get new pricing schemes this fall Hulu had 48.3 million subscribers at the end of the most recent quarter, according to Reuters, compared with 24 million paid subscribers for Comcast’s Peacock streaming service and 105.7 million global subscribers for Disney+.
Hulu is considerably larger than many of its direct competitors.
Sling TV ended the second quarter of 2023 with just over 2 million subscribers, while Fubo had just 1.1 million.
YouTube TV has proven stronger than both of these services, though it hasn’t released numbers since July 2022, when it had just over 5 million subscribers.
The acquisition would give Disney full ownership of one of the most popular cable TV alternative streaming bundles, which include various combinations of Disney+, Hulu, and Disney-owned ESPN+.
The Disney Bundles include: Disney Bundle Duo Basic for $10 per month (Disney+ with ads and Hulu with ads).
Disney Bundle Trio Basic for $15 per month (Disney+ with ads, Hulu with ads, and ESPN+ with ads).
Disney Bundle Trio Premium for $25 per month (Disney+ with no ads, Hulu with no ads, and ESPN+ with ads.
Editors' Recommendations Combined Disney+/Hulu app to launch in beta in December Plex is now a social media platform for movie and TV fans Disney already knows if you’re sharing your streaming account What is Disney Plus: plans, price, and everything else you should know The best kids movies on Hulu right now Hulu Streaming Services Tech News Audio / Video Because the state of streaming video isn't confusing enough, Comcast today announced Now TV, a streaming bundle that includes more than 40 channels from the likes of A&E, AMC, Hallmark, and Warner Bros. Discovery (as in the parent company of the new revamped Max streaming service), as well as more than 20 free ad-supported channels from NBC (which is owned by Comcast), Sky, and Xumo Play. And they're throwing in a subscription to Peacock Premium (that's the streaming service from NBCUniversal), just because.
That's actually a decent amount of streaming video for a decent price of $20 a month.
Audio / Video Hulu With Live TV is one of the largest live TV streaming services (also known as a Multichannel Video Programming Distributor, or MVPD) in the United States. If you want to watch live, linear television, is an excellent option.
Audio / Video The complicated scheme that is the Disney family of streaming services is going to get a little more complicated. Disney CEO Bob Iger, during the company's second-quarter earnings call, announced that Disney is going to create a "one-app experience" in the U.S., bringing Hulu content into the main Disney+ app.
It's also going to increase the price of its ad-free plan, which currently stands at $11 a month.
