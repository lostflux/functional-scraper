By Simon Sage Close Getting an electric vehicle is an exciting prospect, but a high price tag can quickly put a damper on the idea. Luckily there are rebates, tax credits, and incentives abound to help accelerate the adoption of EVs across America. We’re going to help you find the latest in EV incentives so you can finally take the plunge.

For example, the big $7,500 federal rebate requires the car’s final assembly to take place in America. Many of the rebates available are for level-2 chargers installed at home. Others provide lower time-of-use electrical utility rates for charging your car during off-peak periods. The incentives here are geared towards individual EV owners, but there’s also loads of commercial-scale support for those looking to make big investments in EV infrastructure or heavy-duty vehicles.

Recommendations Which cars still qualify for the $7,500 EV tax credit? Here’s the full list Are used EVs eligible for tax rebates? Yes, but here’s the fine print CES 2021 and cars: What we expect in autonomous cars, EVs, and more Thousands of people lied to the IRS to get EV tax credits on gasoline cars Polestar electric vehicle won’t lose $7,500 tax credit because of Volvo sales Cars Following Tesla, General Motors may be the next automaker to reach 200,000 electric car sales, triggering the phaseout of a $7,500 federal tax credit, Reuters reports. While Tesla has said it will lower prices by $2,000 to compensate for the gradual reduction in tax credit amounts, GM won't comment publicly on the matter.
Citing an unnamed source familiar with the matter, Reuters reported that GM hit the 200,000-car ceiling in the fourth quarter of 2018. That means the federal tax credit for GM electric cars will be halved to $3,750 in April, then halved again to $1,875 in October. It will remain at that level for six months before disappearing altogether in April 2020. GM vehicles may still qualify for state and local incentives after the federal tax credit expires, however.
Cars Effective January 1, the federal tax credit for Tesla electric cars has been halved. To make that less of a blow to customers, the Silicon Valley, California, automaker announced that it will reduce the price of the Model S, Model 3, and Model X in the United States by $2,000.
The full federal tax credit for electric cars is $7,500, but the credit begins to phase out once an automaker sells 200,000 cars. Tesla hit that ceiling in July 2018, meaning all cars delivered between January 1 and June 30, 2019 only qualify for a $3,750 federal credit (along with any applicable state and local incentives). The federal credit will be halved again for cars delivered from July 1 to December 31, 2019, to $1,875. After that, the credit disappears entirely.
Cars Lucid Motors has become the latest automaker to announce that it will adopt the North American Charging Standard (NACS) – also known as "the Tesla plug" – for its electric vehicles.
The move follows in the footsteps of more than a dozen other automakers that have also adopted Tesla’s charging connector, among them General Motors, Ford, Toyota, BMW, Jaguar Land Rover, Volvo, and Honda.
