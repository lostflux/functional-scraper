Why trust us? Should you buy an obsolete Apple TV? By Phil Nickinson Close This 2022 Apple TV is not obsolete and will last for years.
Phil Nickinson / Digital Trends This probably should go without saying, but we’re going to say it anyway: We cannot recommend that you buy tech that’s considered to be “obsolete,” or what’s entered a phase called “end of life.” Even if it’s cheap. Even if it’s a “deal.” Even if — or especially because — it’s refurbished. That goes for pretty much any tech. But specifically, in this case, we’re referring to older Apple TV models.
Here’s the deal: The current Apple TV 4K , last refreshed in late 2022, starts at $129. (You should just go ahead and spend the extra $20 to get Ethernet and double the storage, plus support for the Matter smart home standard.) We still consider it to be, pound for pound, the best streaming device you can buy. And that’s before you get into the other stuff it does.
We recently saw a deals post for a refurbished third-generation Apple TV, on sale for $35. That model (A1427, to be exact) was released in March 2012. Here’s our review from back then. It was updated in January 2013 and added support for AirPlay and used less power. The third-gen model was then discontinued in October 2016. That’s not to say it might not work today. Apple TV hardware is remarkably robust, even if this model doesn’t support 4K resolution.
You Asked 10: picture calibration, best budget buys, and premium small screens The hidden costs of buying a 4K TV are way higher than you think NFL buffering on YouTube TV? You’re not alone today You should not buy that 12-year-old Apple TV, even if it’s on sale.
The first three generations of Apple TV are now considered to be obsolete. (Here’s a handy list.
) That means that “Apple discontinues all hardware service for obsolete products, and service providers cannot order parts for obsolete products.” That’s just on the hardware side. You also need to consider software. Only 2015’s Apple TV HD and the 2017, 2021, and 2022 models of Apple TV 4K are running current software. (And, also importantly, that means security fixes.) You should not buy an obsolete 12-year-old Apple TV that has unsupported hardware, and unsupported software. Even if it’s on sale, and especially if it’s refurbished.
There are better ways you could spend that $35. Or even $50 or so, if you just can’t spend the premium that Apple TV 4K commands. The new Amazon Fire TV 4K Max is very good at $60. The same goes for Chromecast with Google TV , at $50. (Or, hell, $30 if you just don’t need 4K resolution.
) And Roku is still around, too, with plenty of current hardware that’ll get the job done at well under $100.
Unless you have a specific reason — like you’re a collector or just really need it for some reason — do not put a 12-year-old, obsolete, unsupported device in your home. You can do far better for that same amount of money.
Editors' Recommendations Sharp’s promised Roku OLED TV is now available and deeply discounted YouTube TV still leads after latest round of streaming numbers YouTube NFL outage: Should Google give refunds or credits? Everyone is missing the point on streaming video Should you install beta updates for Apple TV 4K? Amazon Apple Apple TV Cord Cutting 101 Features Roku TV Audio / Video The new sidebar is visible in the TV app on Apple TV in the tvOS 17.2 developer beta. Phil Nickinson / Digital Trends One of the messier pieces of the Apple TV experience on Apple TV 4K hardware has long been Apple's TV app. It's where Apple has attempted to aggregate all the things you can watch on your Apple TV, from Apple TV+ to any number of installed applications. (Another seriously messy piece is the myriad things Apple has named "Apple TV." But that's another problem for another time.) Audio / Video Subscribers to Apple TV+ are about to get a big surprise as Apple today raised the price of its Apple TV+ streaming service for the second time in its four-year history, hiking it from $7 to $10 per month. Its annual subscription rate also goes from $69 to $99.
The new prices quietly appeared on the company's website today, but Apple TV+ isn't the only service in its roster to see a price increase: Apple's gaming subscription service, Apple Arcade, has gone from $5 per month to $7 per month and its news subscription, Apple News+ goes from $10 per month to $13 per month. This is the first time either of those services has had their prices increased.
Audio / Video Not being able to pick your own games means YouTube TV's multiview could get you two NFL games (one twice) ... and bowling. Phil Nickinson / Digital Trends One of our favorite (and more annoying) games to play is “Which streaming service is the biggest?” And for the most part, we tend to have pretty strong answers. YouTube TV is the biggest, probably. It’s followed by Hulu With Live TV, then Sling TV, and then FuboTV. And DirecTV Stream is way at the back of the pack. Again, probably.
