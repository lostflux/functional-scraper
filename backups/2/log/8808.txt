Meanwhile, the Chiefs (6-2) boast an incredible defense, surrendering the second-fewest points per game (16.1). One player looking to make a statement will be Dolphins wide receiver Tyreek Hill, who spent his first six seasons with the Chiefs.

(via @gmfb ) @Espn_Jordan | @RandyMoss pic.twitter.com/UWnctnBU1a &mdash; NFL Network (@nflnetwork) November 2, 2023 Start Time: 1 p.m. ET Channel: Fox Stream: NFL+ , YouTube TV , Hulu with Live TV , FuboTV , Sling TV After starting 1-4, the Vikings (4-4) are winners of three-straight games and find themselves back at .500. However, quarterback Kirk Cousins is out for the rest of the season with a torn Achilles. Look for the recently acquired Joshua Dobbs to play quarterback for the Vikings. The Vikingsâ€™ first test post-Cousins is on the road in Atlanta against the Falcons (4-4), who will turn to Taylor Heinicke at quarterback.
Seattle Seahawks at Baltimore Ravens start time, channel, and live stream The Core Revealed / Flickr Start Time: 1 p.m. ET Channel: CBS Stream: NFL+ , Paramount+ , YouTube TV , Hulu with Live TV , FuboTV The best matchup in the early window will be played in Baltimore. Seattle is coming off a comeback victory over the Cleveland Browns. The Seahawks (5-2) now have to face one of the best teams in the AFC, the Baltimore Ravens (6-2). Had it not been for a few mistakes in two games, the Ravens would have been 8-0 heading into this game.
Arizona Cardinals at Cleveland Browns start time, channel, and live stream Erik Drost / Flickr Start Time: 1 p.m. ET Channel: CBS Stream: NFL+ , Paramount+ , YouTube TV , Hulu with Live TV , FuboTV The Joshua Dobbs era is over in Arizona as the Cardinals (1-7) prepare to welcome back Kyler Murray to the lineup. However, Murray may not be ready for Sunday. Clayton Tune will start if Murray canâ€™t go. Cleveland also may be without their starting quarterback, Deshaun Watson, who is dealing with a shoulder injury. The Browns (4-3) will turn to P.J. Walker in Watsonâ€™s absence.
Los Angeles Rams at Green Bay Packers start time, channel, and live stream NFL Start Time: 1 p.m. ET Channel: Fox Stream: NFL+ , YouTube TV , Hulu with Live TV , FuboTV , Sling TV The Rams (3-5) are at a crossroads in their season. The Rams cannot afford another loss if they want to stay in the playoff hunt. To make matters worse, quarterback Matthew Stafford will likely be a game-time decision with a thumb injury. Standing in front of the Rams are the Green Bay Packers (2-5), who have lost four straight games. Itâ€™s make-or-break time for Packers quarterback Jordan Love.
Tampa Bay Buccaneers at Houston Texans start time, channel, and live stream That SWARM mentality ðŸ˜¤ pic.twitter.com/dbMjLZ9iOK &mdash; Houston Texans (@HoustonTexans) November 2, 2023 Start Time: 1 p.m. ET Channel: CBS Stream: NFL+ , Paramount+ , YouTube TV , Hulu with Live TV , FuboTV There are better games on the schedule, but the Buccaneers (3-4) versus Texans (3-4) is a key matchup, considering both teams need the win to stay in the playoff race. The Buccaneers could be making a quarterback change if Baker Mayfield loses in Houston. For the Texans, C.J. Stroud is coming off the worst performance of his rookie season, so the young quarterback will be eager to bounce back.
Washington Commanders at New England Patriots start time, channel, and live stream This is Commanders starting quarterback Sam Howell during today&#39;s very chilly practice.
He is 4-5 as a starter in Washington.
He will try to make it 5-5 on Sunday against the Patriots.
pic.twitter.com/kRvCOXQefN &mdash; Scott Abraham (@Scott7news) November 1, 2023 Start Time: 1 p.m. ET Channel: Fox Stream: NFL+ , YouTube TV , Hulu with Live TV , FuboTV , Sling TV The Commanders (3-5) were sellers at the deadline, trading defensive ends Montez Sweat and Chase Young to the Chicago Bears and San Francisco 49ers, respectively. On the positive, quarterback Sam Howell looked promising against the Eagles, finishing with 397 yards and four touchdowns in a losing effort. Speaking of quarterbacks, New England Patriots quarterback Mac Jones continues to regress. Fans are starting to wonder if Bill Belichick will bench Jones if the losing continues.
Chicago Bears at New Orleans Saints start time, channel, and live stream All-Pro Reels Photography / Flickr Start Time: 1 p.m. ET Channel: CBS Stream: NFL+ , Paramount+ , YouTube TV , Hulu with Live TV , FuboTV This game would have been more interesting if quarterback Justin Fields could play. However, itâ€™s looking like Fields will miss another week with a dislocated right thumb. Tyson Bagent will start if Fields canâ€™t play. Bagent has the daunting task of playing the Saints (4-4) and their top 10 defense.
Indianapolis Colts at Carolina Panthers start time, channel, and live stream In four starts, Gardner Minshew is averaging 268.5 passing yards and 1.5 TD passes a game. His opponents in those starts (Ravens, Jaguars, Browns, Saints) rank 1st, 5th, 2nd and 8th in DVOA against the pass.
&mdash; Pat Fitzmaurice (@Fitz_FF) November 2, 2023 Start Time: 4:05 p.m. ET Channel: CBS Stream: NFL+ , Paramount+ , YouTube TV , Hulu with Live TV , FuboTV Despite the poor record, the Colts (3-5) look like they have the right head coach going forward in Shane Steichen. Even with a backup quarterback, the Colts are ranked sixth in points per game (25.6). Indianapolis now faces the Carolina Panthers (1-6), who ended their six-game losing streak in Week 8 to win their first game of the season.
New York Giants at Las Vegas Raiders start time, channel, and live stream From @NFLTotalAccess : Breaking down how and why #Raiders coach Josh McDaniels was fired.
pic.twitter.com/1TqjQLRG81 &mdash; Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) November 1, 2023 Start Time: 4:25 p.m. ET Channel: Fox Stream: NFL+ , YouTube TV , Hulu with Live TV , FuboTV , Sling TV On paper, this is a bad game. The Giants (2-6) are coming off an embarrassing 13-10 overtime loss to the New York Jets. The Giants finished the game with -9 passing yards because they refused to let third-string quarterback Tommy DeVito throw the ball in the second half. The Giants play the new-look Raiders, who fired head coach Josh McDaniels and general manager Dave Ziegler earlier this week. Additionally, the Raiders are benching quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo in favor of Aidan Oâ€™Connell.
Dallas Cowboys at Philadelphia Eagles start time, channel, and live stream All-Pro Reels / Flickr Start Time: 4:25 p.m. ET Channel: Fox Stream: NFL+ , YouTube TV , Hulu with Live TV , FuboTV , Sling TV The entire NFL world will be watching the Cowboys (5-2) versus the Eagles (7-1) on late Sunday afternoon. The Cowboys and Eagles are considered two of the best teams in the NFC. If Dallas wants to be taken seriously as a contender, they need to beat the Eagles in Philadelphia on Sunday. If Philadelphia wins, they are in the driverâ€™s seat for the division and the top seed in the conference.
Buffalo Bills at Cincinnati Bengals start time, channel, and live stream Erik Drost / Wiki Commons Start Time: 8:20 p.m. ET Channel: NBC Stream: NFL+ , , YouTube TV , Hulu with Live TV , FuboTV , Sling TV Donâ€™t look now, but the Bengals (4-3) are healthy and back to championship form after winning three straight games. The Bengals welcome the Bills (5-3) to Cincinnati for Sunday Night Football. When these two teams last met in Cincinnati, tragedy struck as Buffaloâ€™s Demar Hamlin suffered a cardiac arrest and had to be revived on the field. Thankfully, Hamlin survived and will be on the sidelines for this game.
Editors' Recommendations 5 sci-fi movies on Netflix you need to watch in November NFL games today: schedule, channels, live streams for November 12 Miami Dolphins vs. Kansas City Chiefs live stream: watch the NFL for free Houston Texans vs. Carolina Panthers live stream: watch the NFL for free Miami Dolphins vs. Philadelphia Eagles live stream: watch the NFL for free Entertainment After Week 6, there are no more undefeated teams in the NFL. The San Francisco 49ers (5-1) fell to the Cleveland Browns (3-2), and the Philadelphia Eagles (5-1) lost to the New York Jets (3-3). Five teams now sit atop the standings with 5-1 records: the 49ers, Eagles, Kansas City Chiefs, Detroit Lions, and Miami Dolphins.
Speaking of the Dolphins and the Eagles, those two teams will meet on Sunday Night Football in the "Game of the Week." Overall, 11 games are on the Week 7 schedule for Sunday, October 22. Besides Miami versus Philadelphia, the best early game will be played in Baltimore as Lamar Jackson and the Ravens (4-2) play Jared Goff and the Lions.

Detroit Lions at Baltimore Ravens start time, channel, and live stream Entertainment An AFC West rivalry will write another chapter when the Los Angeles Chargers (2-3) head to the Midwest on Sunday afternoon to play the Kansas City Chiefs (5-1). The pivotal showdown will be at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri. On FanDuel, the Chiefs are 5.5-point favorites.
It's a kitchen sink game for the Chargers, as they need to win to stay in the hunt for the playoffs. Meanwhile, the Chiefs are attempting to win the AFC West for the eighth straight year. Whenever the Chargers and Chiefs play, expect the final score to be close. The Chiefs have won the previous three matchups, dating back to the 2021 season.
Watch the Chargers vs. Chiefs live stream on CBS Entertainment If there's one thing that football fans in Green Bay can take heart from, it's that their beloved Packers have at least won twice as many games as Denver's football team. Unfortunately for both teams, their collective total number of victories this season is now three. But hey, somebody has to win when the Green Bay Packers (2-3) take on the Denver Broncos (1-5) in Denver. The Packers are a 1-point favorite on FanDuel. Green Bay and Denver last played in September 2019, with the Packers winning by a score of 27-16.
Because both teams are playing very poorly this season, the 1-point spread suggests that analysts aren't expecting a high-scoring game. It also means this is really anyone's game, and either the Broncos or the Packers can step up and add another victory to their win column. If you're looking for ways to watch the game, live TV streaming services will broadcast the Packers versus the Broncos. Sling TV is an option for consumers looking for the game on a live TV streaming service. Below, you'll find more information on how to watch the Packers take on the Broncos.
