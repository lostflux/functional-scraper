The update is rolling out in waves, so if you don’t yet have the feature, it should be arriving soon.
How to enable Sound Recognition How to disable Sound Recognition and smoke alarm monitoring Difficulty Duration What You Need HomePod iPhone or iPad When your HomePod detects an alarm going off inside your home, the Sound Recognition feature will send a notification to all iPhones and iPads linked to that Apple Home account. It’s a pretty useful update, and as long as you have smoke and carbon monoxide alarms in your home (which everyone should), there’s no reason to ignore the new capabilities of your HomePod.
However, you need to go through a very brief setup phase to get the Sound Recognition feature working. Here’s how to enable Sound Recognition on your HomePod and get smoke alarm alerts.
Zeke Jones/Digital Trends How to enable Sound Recognition Before trying to enable Sound Recognition on your HomePod, you’ll first need to make sure you’re running iOS 16.4 or later and using the latest version of Apple Home. You’ll also need to have a smoke alarm or carbon monoxide alarm in your home, as HomePod itself can’t detect these hazards – instead, it simply alerts you that your existing alarms have been triggered.
With that out of the way, here’s how to enable Sound Recognition.
Step 1: Launch the Home app. If the Sound Recognition feature has been rolled out to your device, you’ll see a notification titled New Safety & Security Features.
Step 2: Press the Continue button, then select Turn On.
Step 3: With that done, Sound Recognition will now be activated for your HomePod.
Step 4: If you missed the New Safety & Security Features prompt when it launched on your screen, dive into the Settings menu and look for the Safety & Security submenu.
Step 5: Finally, select Sound Recognition and you’ll have the option to toggle the feature on.
How to disable Sound Recognition and smoke alarm monitoring No longer want your HomePod to alert you when your smoke or carbon monoxide alarm is going off? Simply select the HomePod you’d like to deactivate, enter its Settings menu, and find the Sound Recognition section. From here, you’ll be able to disable the feature.
There’s really no reason to deactivate the feature (unless you’re getting ready to test your alarms and don’t want to get notifications), so it’s highly recommended you keep Sound Recognition enabled.

How to create spooky Halloween effects with smart home lighting and sound How to set up Apple TV as a HomeKit hub How to update your HomePod or HomePod mini Apple How-To Guides Speakers Smart Home Apple HomeKit may not have as many compatible products as Amazon Alexa or Google Home, but its still a great smart home platform for dedicated iOS enthusiasts. Not only is the platform supported by the Home app on iOS, but you can also control devices using your HomePod or Apple TV.
Smart Home Unlike Amazon Alexa and Google Home, you won’t find many Apple HomeKit hubs. In fact, you’re largely left deciding between HomePod mini and Apple TV 4K -- both of which work incredibly well as HomeKit hubs but serve radically different purposes.
If you’re trying to figure out if HomePod mini or Apple TV 4K would be a better HomeKit hub, here’s everything you need to know.
Pricing Smart Home Apple’s HomePod mini is a smart speaker that’s designed as more of a personal assistant and music device than a whole-house speaker hub. This little speaker is ready to work within your entire Apple ecosystem, but you have to set it up properly first.
