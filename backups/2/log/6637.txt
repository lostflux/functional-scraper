Editors' Recommendations All the best 65-inch TV Black Friday deals you can shop now You can get a 65-inch QLED 4K TV for $400 right now (seriously) How to reset the TCL Q6 QLED Google TV Sony Bravia X95L mini-LED vs. TCL QM8 QLED: The best LCD TV and the one you should buy Should you buy an obsolete Apple TV? How-To Guides Audio / Video When it comes to streaming live TV in the U.S. (or streaming any kind of video anywhere, for that matter), resolution and bit rate remain as important as ever. And you're now able to enjoy YouTube TV in 4K. Some of it, at least. And if it seems like it's taken forever for that to happen, you're not wrong.
The basic fact is that it takes a lot of bandwidth to stream video â€” and that's even more difficult when you're talking linear TV, (and more so still if it's a live event like sports). So it's not really that much of a surprise to learn that most live channels stream at 720p resolution â€” or maybe 1080p if you're lucky. (We'll leave frame rate out of the equation for a minute, but it's a thing, too, especially for sports.) Audio / Video If you've always wanted to buy a huge 4K TV for your living room or bedroom but you don't want to spend more than $500, then this is what you've been waiting for -- the 65-inch LG 65UQ7070ZUE 4K TV for just $458 from Walmart. The $100 in savings on its sticker price of $558 probably won't last long because this is made by one of the best TV brands, so if you want to take advantage of this offer, you're going to have to complete the transaction as soon as possible. If you push it back to tomorrow, you may already be too late.
Why you should buy the 65-inch LG 65UQ7070ZUE 4K TV First of all, you need to check our guide on what size TV to buy to make sure that the 65-inch display of the LG 65UQ7070ZUE 4K TV will fit the space where you're planning to place it. Once you've confirmed that it will, then you're all set for immersive viewing with the TV's 4K Ultra HD resolution for sharp details and vivid colors, powered by LG's Î±5 Gen5 AI Processor that uses artificial intelligence to enhance picture and sound.
Audio / Video When it comes to smart TVs, these monolithic QLEDs and OLEDs require an internet connection to get you connected to services like Netflix and Disney+. But like any good computer or mobile phone, thereâ€™s an operating system taking care of apps, navigation, and all things user interface-oriented behind the scenes. For Samsung TVs, this OS is called Tizen, for LG TVs, itâ€™s webOS, and for brands like Sony, TCL, and Hisense, it used to be called Android TV, but now (for the most part) itâ€™s called Google TV.
While Google TV is really just an evolutionary leap based on the building blocks of Android TV, youâ€™ll still see the Android TV moniker on a modern TV or two. Many modern home theater projectors also use the Android TV OS. That being said, itâ€™s a platform thatâ€™s still relevant. Hereâ€™s everything you need to know about Android TV.
