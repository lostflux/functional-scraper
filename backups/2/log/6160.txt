As such, it’s important that you stay appropriately leveled throughout your journey so that you stand a better chance of survival. In Lords of the Fallen , there happens to be a specific spot that provides a fantastic opportunity for quick leveling in the early game, while remaining viable even late into the adventure when you need to get a bit of extra XP. We’ll fill you in below.
Best XP farming spot in Lords of the Fallen Relatively early on in the game while venturing through Pilgrim’s Perch, you’ll come across a vestige in a place called the Bellroom. While facing the vestige, you’ll see a large enemy with a spiked cage on its head down the left pathway. This foe and its Umbral Parasite can be defeated for a bit over 500 Vigor, allowing you to then immediately rest at the vestige and repeat the process as many times as you’d like.
CI Games This XP farming method is immensely useful in the early hours of the game, as you can easily gain multiple levels in just a few minutes by quickly taking the enemy down over and over. Shockingly, though, it remains a fantastic option even late in the game due to how quickly you’ll be able to drop the baddie and reset the encounter. If you’re about to face a boss or make a run through a rough section of the game and don’t want to risk the many thousands of Vigor you currently have, just fast travel back to the Bellroom and farm this poor fellow a few times until you can level up. You’ll then be ready to comfortably head back into the fray.

PS5 consoles are discounted in Walmart’s Black Friday sale The brand new PS5 ‘Slim’ is already discounted Where to find planes in Fortnite OG The best PS5 controllers for 2023 How to play split screen in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 How-To Guides Microsoft Sony Sony PlayStation Sony PlayStation 5 Xbox Gaming The PlayStation 5 has finally established a respectable list of console-exclusive titles between first- and third-party developers. These games are able to take full advantage of the PS5 hardware thanks to not needing to worry about developing for other platforms. If you want to play some of the most impressive games you can on your system, no matter what genre you like most, these exclusives are the ones to check out.
In this guide, we'll round up the very best exclusive games the system has to offer. The PS5's exclusive library will undoubtedly grow throughout its life cycle, and we will update this article accordingly as more games come out.
Gaming If you’re the kind of PlayStation loyalist who buys every add-on Sony puts out, 2023 may have been a pricey year for you. We’ve gotten the DualSense Edge, PlayStation VR2, a brand new PS5 model, and the PlayStation Portal -- but that’s not all. Sony is refreshing its audio offerings on top of all that, starting with the Pulse Explore next month.
Sony’s new wireless earbuds are built with PlayStation devices in mind. They use a new PlayStation Link connection system, which is built to easily pair them with the PlayStation 5. That tech actually replaces Bluetooth entirely on the new PlayStation Portal, which means that the Pulse Explore will be one of the only ways to get wireless audio on the handheld this year. It’s a sign that Sony is getting more aggressive about building a dedicated PlayStation ecosystem, Apple-style. It doesn’t just want you to buy Sony consoles, but all of the black-and-white accessories that go with them too.
Gaming If there's one thing besides your gun that you need to ensure is customized just perfectly in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, it's definitely the layout of your perks. You get to choose one perk from each of the four categories, and you'll want to be sure they match ideally with your playstyle. As such, your perfect perk selections will ultimately come down to personal taste, but we've compiled a list of the two best perks from each category that we feel will be useful on the widest variety of loadouts. Read on to see what we've chosen as the best perks in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3.
Best vest perks The best perk for your vest slot depends a lot on your playstyle. If you find that you're a run-and-gun type, you may prefer the Gunner Vest since it spawns you with the maximum amount of ammo while also providing faster reload speed for every gun. That being said, the Engineer Vest can be invaluable for those who want to take things slow because it shows you killstreaks and field equipment through walls, which can save your life by letting you know exactly what to expect in the next room and letting you plan accordingly.
Best gloves perks The best perk for your gloves slot is generally going to be the Scavenger Gloves due to them allowing you to restock ammo off of fallen players, keeping you in the fight longer if you can manage to keep dropping your foes. However, you may prefer the faster weapon swapping that comes with the Quick-Grip Gloves in certain cases, particularly if you find that you're frequently swapping to your sidearm to finish off your enemies.
Best boots perks The best perk for your boots slot is either the Lightweight Boots or Covert Sneakers. The former grants you noticeably faster movement speed both on land and in water, while the former completely reduces your footstep audio to make you significantly sneakier as you run around the map looking for your next kill. If you're a guns-blazing kind of player, Lightweight may actually work best at letting you rapidly approach other players, but being able to slink around with Covert Sneakers is definitely unmatched for those taking things a little slower.
Best gear perks The best perk for your gear slot is probably Mission Control Commlink, as it reduces the number of kills required to earn killstreaks, which will in turn provide you with even more options in combat. However, don't sleep on Ghost T/V Camo either, as this will stop you from showing up on your opponents' radar while you're moving, making their UAVs and Heartbeat Sensors useless when it comes to you.
