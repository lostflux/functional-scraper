Who we are Digital Trends, the largest independent premium technology publisher in the world, is an award-winning multimedia brand that guides consumers to the best products and services available today — and uncovers the innovations that will shape their lives tomorrow. With more than 6 million social followers and a website that reaches 30 million worldwide, the brand interacts with more than 100 million people per month.
We cover tech for the way you live: not just gadgets, but the powers they unlock in your life, the story of the people who made them, and the way they’re reshaping the world outside your window. Digital Trends filters the torrent of devices and innovation that surround us through a human lens that elevates experience above specs, hype, and marketing. The rapid pace of change creates a conversation that’s always engaging, entertaining, and challenging. You don’t have time to become an expert. But we’ll help you become one.
Meet the team Digital Trends writes for people beyond your average tech geek. Many folks who don’t care at all about tech rely upon the dozens of editors and writers at Digital Trends for news on the latest iPhone software update, how to fix their laptop, and what TV model to buy. Here are the people that make it all possible — and the principles of transparency, equity, and integrity they strive to uphold.
Andrew Martonik Editor-in-Chief Andrew Martonik is the Editor in Chief at Digital Trends. He took on the EIC role in July 2021 following several months leading DT’s Mobile section. Andrew’s journey in the technology world started well over a decade ago, back when the Palm Treo and DSL internet had everyone excited. That obsession with tech quickly spread to phones of all kinds, and naturally shifted to computers, software, and beyond.
Andrew helped lead extensive coverage of the mobile world at Mobile Nations (later Future Plc) for 8 years, and continues to live for the ins and outs of the entire tech landscape at Digital Trends. He’s an enthusiast for technology of all kinds – computers, phones, games, cameras, and mobility are just a few of the many focal points of his analysis and insight.
Nick Mokey Managing Editor As Digital Trends’ Managing Editor, Nick Mokey oversees an editorial team delivering definitive reviews, enlightening buying guides, and incisive analysis. His decade-long career at the company has seen him writing, editing, managing, hosting videos, guiding conference tours, moderating panels, and presenting Tech Talks to companies including Microsoft and GM. He never met a headline he couldn’t tighten up.
Offline, you can find Nick hiking, biking, riding motorcycles, woodworking, or puttering down forest roads in the 4×4 camping van he imported from Japan. He grew up in Rochester, NY, holds a degree in Magazine Journalism from Syracuse University, and still drinks Genesee beer.
