In an event billed as the world’s largest and first public event showcasing multiple eVTOL aircraft in a city environment, New York City Mayor Eric Adams looked on as Joby Aviation and Volocopter flew their fully electric aircraft to and from Manhattan’s Downtown Heliport.

Adams announced that the city plans to electrify the heliport for cleaner and quieter flights that will include the current tourist trips and hops to and from nearby airports and freight delivery.
“Today, we are taking sustainability to the sky and our street … as we electrify our heliport infrastructure,” said Mayor Adams. “Our vision for the Downtown Manhattan Heliport will create the world’s first heliport with infrastructure for electric-powered aircraft and put this public asset to work for New Yorkers as a hub for sustainable transportation and local deliveries.” Adams added that the move would deal with the “persistent quality-of-life issue with helicopter noise, [and] also get trucks off the road and make our streets safer.” It’s not clear when the facility will be up and running as it first needs building out for electric aircraft, and Joby and Volocopter’s flying machines still need to clear a number of regulatory hurdles.
California-based Joby has been working on its electric aircraft for more than a decade and has received backing from the likes of Toyota, Intel, and Delta Air Lines. The company shared images of its New York flight in a post on social media on Tuesday: Joby Flies in NYC — This week we completed several piloted flights from the iconic Downtown Manhattan Heliport, and were honored to join the NYC Mayor as he announced the city&#39;s intent to electrify the heliport, placing NYC at the forefront of adopting clean, quiet air travel.

Joby’s vehicle has five seats and can reach speeds of up to 200 mph, while Volocopter’s fits two passengers and has a top speed of 62 mph.

Computing We've recently heard that Nvidia and AMD may soon be ready to launch their own ARM-based client processors. That, combined with predictions that ARM chips might account for up to 30% of the PC market in just a few years, sounds like worrying information for rivals. However, Intel appears to be anything but worried as it rides the high of its surprisingly good earnings. Is the threat of ARM chips really as insignificant as Intel's CEO makes it out to be? Right now, Intel dominates the client CPU market by a large margin, although AMD also makes some of the best processors and is a formidable competitor in its own right. Either way, both companies base their chips on the x86 system architecture. However, Microsoft has taken great interest in the ARM architecture over the years, and both AMD and Nvidia will soon be able to jump in. Until 2024, Qualcomm has an exclusive deal for making ARM-based chips for Windows devices, but when that deal is up, there's nothing left to stop other manufacturers from making their own chips. With the path cleared and Qualcomm leading the charge, the transition to ARM for Windows machines seems more possible than ever.
News When you think of drone delivery, you probably imagine a midsized drone carrying a coffee or a small snack to a customer waiting outside their home in a residential area. What you won’t think of is a large, pilotless, multi-rotor machine carrying cargo over choppy waters to a massive wind turbine.
But that’s exactly what energy firm Ørsted has started doing in the North Sea off the east coast of the U.K.
