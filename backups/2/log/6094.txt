That means you’ll no longer be able to quickly share screenshots or videos to X from the console.
“As of November 13, 2023, integration with X (formerly known as Twitter) will no longer function on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 consoles,” the notification ( as screenshotted by Wario64 ) states. “This includes the ability to view any content published on X on PS5 /PS4, and the ability to post and view content, trophies, and other gameplay-related activities on X directly from PS5/ PS5 (or link an X account to do so).” Sony Since the release of the PS4, people have been able to share screenshots and videos taken with the controller’s Share button with social media services. Twitter historically was one of those platforms, but API changes following Elon Musk’s buying of the platform and rebranding to X have interfered with its integration with many platforms. Now, it seems that Sony has decided that it’s best just to rid PlayStation platforms of any X integration whatsoever. PlayStation has not publicly commented on why it’s removing this feature yet, but we’ve contacted them for comment and will update this story when we get a response.
If there are any screenshots or videos on your PS4 or PS5 that you want to get onto X, you have until November 13 to do so. After that, Apple, Discord, Spotify, Twitch, and YouTube will be the only services one can link their PlayStation account to.
Editors' Recommendations Sony’s new PlayStation earbuds are a perfect match — for my Nintendo Switch PlayStation boss Jim Ryan is stepping down, with successor yet to be named PlayStation 5 Slim: All rumors and speculation The most exciting PlayStation Showcase trailers you shouldn’t miss PlayStation gets into the streaming handheld game with Project Q Sony Sony PlayStation Sony PlayStation 5 Tech News Twitter Gaming The flurry of summer gaming showcases is finally upon us, and Sony was the one to start things off. After a 20-month wait and several smaller presentations, we finally got another PlayStation Showcase where we saw what's next for first-party, third-party, and indie games on the PlayStation 5 and PlayStation VR2. During the show, we got a look at some upcoming multiplayer games from PlayStation Studios like Fairgame$ and Marathon, in addition to exciting single-player titles like Marvel's Spider-Man 2.
Third-party studios also showed up, with Square Enix unveiling a multiplayer game called Foamstars, Alan Wake 2 and Assassin's Creed Mirage getting release dates, and Konami announcing a remake of Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater. This was definitely the most important PlayStation livestream to happen in a long time, but it was a densely packed show so you might have missed out on some of its announcements. That's why you should read through this recap of everything announced during the May 2023 PlayStation Showcase.
Gaming It's been a very long time since the last PlayStation Showcase. While Sony has held tons of smaller State of Play streams over the years, it doesn't often host Nintendo Direct-sized events that give a wide picture of what's coming to the PS5. That'll change later today when the company hosts a proper PlayStation Showcase, just a few weeks before Summer Game Fest.
Details on what we'll see at the event are sparse, even hours ahead of the showcase, but there's a lot we can already predict. You won't want to miss out on this one, so here's everything you need to know so you can catch it when it right when it airs.
When is PlayStation Showcase? Gaming Sony revealed new details about its PlayStation 5 accessibility controller, which has been renamed from Project Leonardo to the Access Controller. A new blog post details what comes with the controller and offers a glimpse at the UI interface that players will use to customize it on the PS5.
Sony surprise revealed its "Project Leonardo" at CES earlier this year (Digital Trends named it the best gaming tech of the show). The circular pad features a unique design meant to make it easier for people with disabilities to customize controls to their needs. While it still doesn't have a price or release date, Sony has opened a new website for its newly renamed Access Controller and shared new details on it.
