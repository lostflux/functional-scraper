The move follows in the footsteps of more than a dozen other automakers that have also adopted Tesla’s charging connector, among them General Motors, Ford, Toyota, BMW, Jaguar Land Rover, Volvo, and Honda.
“Lucid is adopting the North American Charging Standard (NACS) and expanding access to reliable and convenient charging solutions,” Lucid said in a message posted on social media on Monday, adding that from 2025 its customers will be able to access more than 15,000 Tesla Superchargers across North America.

Tesla says Cybertruck resellers could face harsh penalties Tesla’s Cybertruck finally gets a delivery date Volkswagen ID.4 vs Tesla Model Y “Adopting NACS is an important next step to providing our customers with expanded access to reliable and convenient charging solutions for their Lucid vehicles,” said Lucid CEO Peter Rawlinson. “We believe that a unified charging standard, backed by the nationwide rollout of future-ready higher-voltage charging stations, will be a critical step in empowering American consumers to adopt electric vehicles.” Interestingly, Rawlinson once worked as the chief engineer at Tesla and was involved in the design of the automaker’s charging plug.
With so many automakers now promising to switch to the NACS plug, it was only a matter of time before the maker of luxury electric vehicles fell into line. Indeed, Rawlinson indicated in early July that Lucid would likely adopt the design at some point.
