As if centering the taskbar in Windows 11 wasn’t enough, Microsoft is now going to alter a Windows keyboard shortcut that’s been around forever. We’re talking about Print Screen, commonly written as PrtSc on keycaps, which currently takes a full-screen screenshot of the screen and saves it to your clipboard. Of course, it can also be used in combination with various keys for other screenshotting shortcuts.
But in recent years, Microsoft has been pushing its separate app, Snipping Tool, which was a modern replacement for Snip & Sketch. Compared to using Print Screen, though, Snipping Tool is a more effective and full-featured way of capturing, saving, and editing screenshots. There’s no need to paste your screenshot into Paint just to save it. It can also record video of your screen.

Overall, I think that’s a smart change. Snipping Tool is great, offering a more modern way to screenshot in the Windows operating system.
The only downside is the time it takes to open up Snipping Tool and click on one of the options. When you need a quick screenshot, sometimes that quick keypress can be a lifesaver.
Windows 11 will soon harness your GPU for generative AI ‘Compact Mode’ can’t fix the Xbox app. Here’s what could Surprise: Windows 11 is doing much better than we thought Fortunately, you’ll still be able to turn off the feature in Settings under Accessibility > Keyboard , where you can toggle between the two capabilities of the Print Screen key.
The feature was found in a version of Windows 11 in the Beta Channel, so how this update will roll out isn’t clear.
Editors' Recommendations Windows is just an application now Windows 11 might finally reverse course on preinstalled applications A major Windows update just launched. Here’s what’s new I love Macs. But here are 5 reasons I keep coming back to Windows In the year of AI, is background blur really the best we can do? Microsoft Microsoft Windows Tech News Windows 11 Computing I install Windows 11 a lot. Be it for a clean slate on a PC that's acting up or a brand new PC, anyone who tinkers with computers will find themselves interacting with the Windows installer quite a bit. And it's far from perfect.
Over the past year, it's gotten worse, too. This is because Windows 11 now requires you to connect to the internet before proceeding with installation. If you don't have a connection (or another issues occurs, as I'll get to in a moment), you're out of luck. You're stuck. Thankfully, there's a Windows 11 shortcut that can crack open the installer and give you a lot more power: Shift + F10.
Computing If you've just upgraded to the latest version of the Windows operating system, Windows 11, you're probably ready to dive in and customize its appearance.

Explore native Windows 11 themes first Computing Did we just get a confirmation about the release time frame for Windows 12 -- and from Intel, of all sources? It seems that way. Intel spoke about its predictions for 2024, indicating that it expects 2024 to be a good year for client processors. That's huge for Intel because the next generation of its top processors, Meteor Lake, is set to come out in 2024. However, if Intel is right, it might be a big year for Microsoft, too.
The information comes from a transcript of the Citi 2023 Global Technology Conference. Most of it wasn't too exciting -- fireside chats aren't often that interesting to the masses -- but there's a little comment in there that piqued our interest.
