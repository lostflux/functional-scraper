Short for Spectro-Photometer for the History of the Universe, Epoch of Reionization and Ices Explorer, SPHEREx is starting to come together in a clean room at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California, with the spacecraft’s distinctive cone shape already clear for everyone to see.
NASA/JPL-Caltech There are a further two smaller cones nestled within the outer one. These surround SPHEREx’s telescope to protect it from the light and heat of the sun and Earth when it’s in orbit.
“SPHEREx has to be quite agile because the spacecraft has to move relatively quickly as it scans the sky,” JPL’s Sara Susca, deputy payload manager and payload systems engineer for the mission, said in Thursday’s update. “It doesn’t look that way, but the shields are actually quite light and made with layers of material like a sandwich. The outside has aluminum sheets, and inside is an aluminum honeycomb structure that looks like cardboard — light but sturdy.” NASA’s Mars helicopter glimpses Perseverance rover from the sky Watch a replica of NASA’s Mars helicopter take flight on Earth NASA’s plucky Mars helicopter eyes another flight record Built by Ball Aerospace in Boulder, Colorado, the spacecraft’s all-important telescope will collect infrared light from distant sources using three mirrors and six detectors.
Over two years, the SPHEREx telescope will map the entire sky four times to create a huge database featuring galaxies, stars, nebulae, and other celestial objects.
The aim of the mission is to help scientists gain a better understanding of where water and other key ingredients necessary for life originated. The mission will do this by measuring the abundance of water ice in interstellar clouds of gas and dust, places where new stars form and where planets are eventually created.
The SPHEREx team will also be able to study the cosmic history of galaxies, learning more about when they began to form and how they’ve changed over time.
Last but not least, scientists will be able to use SPHEREx’s map of millions of galaxies to try to find out more about how the rapid expansion of the universe occurred a fraction of a second after the Big Bang.
NASA confirmed the SPHEREx mission in 2019 and SpaceX will launch the spacecraft from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California no later than April 2025.

After departing the Kennedy Space Center in Florida atop NASA’s new Space Launch System (SLS) rocket on November 16, the uncrewed Orion passed over the surface of the moon at an altitude of just 81 miles. It then entered what’s known as a distant retrograde orbit where it stayed for several weeks, and is now about to begin its voyage home.
Space NASA's InSight Mars lander reached the red planet four years ago and has worked well beyond the two years originally set for the mission. But in the coming weeks or perhaps months, the lander will make its final communications with Earth before falling silent for the rest of time.
A gradual accumulation of Martian dust on the lander’s solar panels has reduced its ability to retain power, and so it will soon be unable to continue its seismology work gathering data about the red planet’s interior.
Space You might think that the sky above is unchanging, at least on our human timescales, but that isn't the case. The night sky is active and changing, and it’s visible even on scales of years. Recently, NASA shared a time lapse animation showing the changes in the night sky over a period of more than a decade. Using data collected by the NEOWISE spacecraft, this all-sky map shows how the sky has changed between the launch of the spacecraft in 2009 and today.
