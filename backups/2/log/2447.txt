All three are Halloween-inspired, making them a great way to get your smart home ready for trick-or-treaters.
Available on almost all Ring video doorbells (minus the 1st Generation), users will now find the Werewolf Howl, Children Trick or Treating, and Witch Fire Burn and Cauldron Bubble Quick Replies. These tunes will play for your visitors after they’ve pressed your doorbell button, which is the perfect way to give your guests a spooky welcome.
Ring Setting up your new Quick Replies is simple. After loading the Ring app, dive into the main menu, then find the Devices section. From here, pick the doorbell you want to set up, then press the Smart Responses tile. This will load the Quick Replies section, where you’ll be able to toggle on Quick Replies and choose which sound you want to play.
To coincide with the spooky Quick Replies, Ring also released new Chime Tones, such as a creaky door opening and an organ playing eerie music. If your chime doesn’t support the tunes, you can get them to play on your Echo smart speaker using the Alexa app (just find your doorbell, enter its Settings menu, and choose one of the new sounds).

Ecobee takes on Ring, Arlo with its first smart doorbell camera Ring helps you find your lost furry friend with the Ring Pet Tag How long does a Ring Video Doorbell battery last? Home Security Tech News Video Doorbells Smart Home Smart home gadgets span a wide range of categories. From video doorbells and robot vacuums to outdoor cameras and smart speakers, smart gadgets can be found in all corners of the modern home. Now, thanks to Home Depot, you can now snag the first residential smart door -- and it features a built-in Yale smart lock and Ring video doorbell.
Before you rush out to your local Home Depot, it’s worth noting that this futuristic smart door comes with a hefty price tag of $4,000. Multiple styles are available, including two different sizes and additional sidelites, and depending on your configuration, its price can balloon to an eye-watering $7,000.
Smart Home The smart home concept is a great thing. It allows us to automate things from lighting to temperature, make video calls while we prepare dinner, and get answers to questions instantly. In its current state, it has one fatal flaw, however: The smart home is not really meant to move.
In fact, you might want to leave behind the majority of your smart home gadgets when selling your property.
What to know about moving smart home gadgets Think about it: Some of us have literally dozens of devices including lights, thermostats, robot vacuums, speakers, security cameras, wireless alarm systems, and more. How would you go about removing, relocating, and reconnecting all those devices to Wi-Fi in a new house if you ever need to move? On the surface, it sounds daunting.
Smart Home While video doorbells from Ring, Arlo, and Nest are great additions to any smart home, they’re not without their quirks. Depending on your model, you might have to deal with frequent battery changes, incompatible chimes, or motion settings that constantly need to be adjusted. Most of those are easy to live with (or can be modified to your preference), but one thing that’s out of your control is the weather. And, like most electronics, video doorbells have some strict limits on what they can endure.
If you live in a location with scorching summers, here’s what you need to know about how video doorbells work in extreme heat.
