Why trust us? Hisense’s mini-LED U6K TV arrives, starting at $500 By Simon Cohen Close Hisense At CES 2023 , Hisense promised to bring the U6K mini-LED 4K TV to buyers for under $500.
 And while it didn’t quite make good on that exact wording, we’re still impressed that the U6K is now here and available for exactly $500 in the 55-inch screen size.
 It’s available right now at Amazon and at Best Buy, along with the 65-inch ($650), and 75-inch ($848) models.
Hisense To put Hisense’s achievement in perspective, TCL’s most affordable mini-LED TV is the 65-inch QM8, which sells for $1,298.
Hisense says the U6K has four times more local dimming zones (up to 200-plus), with deeper blacks and improved contrast ratios, enhanced brightness (up to 600 nits of peak brightness) and contrast, plus better clarity and uniformity.
The hidden costs of buying a 4K TV are way higher than you think Vizio’s new Quantum 4K QLED TVs hit 75 inches for $699 Mini-LED vs. QLED TV: how one technology is improving the other These quantum dot-based TVs support Dolby Vision , Dolby Vision Gaming, and Dolby Atmos and use the Google TV smart TV software for all of the built-in streaming services , games, and other apps. Far-field mics are also built-in, letting you use voice commands from across the room instead of picking up the remote.
The only real limitation to be aware of is that the U6K’s four HDMI ports use the HDMI 2.0 specification, not HDMI 2.1.
 This means no 4K at 120Hz, and no support for variable refresh rate (VRR), which may be a consideration if you’re thinking of using the U6K for gaming.
Wondering how the U6K performs? We don’t have a review ready yet, but if the U6K is anything like Hisense’s other 2023 TVs, like the U7H and U8H , it will likely be a very compelling TV from both a price and performance point of view.
The U6K is the first 2023 mini-LED TV model that Hisense has released, but we are still waiting for the company to provide pricing and release dates for its much anticipated U7K and U8K mini-LED TVs that were also showcased at CES 2023.
Editors' Recommendations Hisense teases 110-inch, 10,000-nit TV ahead of CES 2024 Sony Bravia X95L mini-LED vs. TCL QM8 QLED: The best LCD TV and the one you should buy What is mini-LED TV? How smaller, brighter LEDs can deliver better TV picture quality YouTube TV in 4K: Everything you need to know Hisense just debuted the world’s largest mini-LED TV at 100 inches Hisense Tech News TV Audio / Video Samsung's line of Terrace outdoor TVs now has its biggest and brightest model yet. The 85-inch Class Terrace Full Sun is a Neo QLED 4K TV -- the first Terrace TV to use Samsung's mini-LED backlighting. At an eye-watering $20,000, it's not going to be for everyone, but if you have the means and the desire, it can be preordered via Samsung.com between August 29 and September 10.
Samsung says the 85-inch Class Terrace Full Sun can stay bright even on the sunniest days -- up to six hours in sunlight at 700 watts and 104 degrees Fahrenheit -- thanks to Direct-Sun Protection. The company notes that brightness may decrease to protect the panel from other high temperature and sunlight conditions. Even the included Samsung SolarCell Remote is sun-friendly, and can recharge itself using indoor or outdoor light sources.
Audio / Video Why wait for a new product to go on sale when you grab a huge discount on day one? That's clearly the thinking behind Hisense's retail launch of its 2023 U8K mini-LED 4K TV, which arrives in stores today. The flagship TV is available in 55-, 65-, and 75-inch screen sizes. Normally, these are priced at $1,300, $1,700, and $2,300 respectively, but for a limited time, Hisense has dramatically reduced all three, which are currently at $800, $1,100, and $1,600.
U8K is the company's flagship TV and marries the impressive benefits of quantum dots with the precise brightness control of mini-LED backlighting. The U8K offers Hisense's best and brightest picture quality -- that is, until (and if) Hisense releases the UX TV it teased at CES 2023. And it's loaded with features that will make it a strong contender if you're looking for a great TV without spending a fortune.
Audio / Video In May, TCL stunned us with the price of its new Q Class QM8 98-inch TV. At a mere $10,000, it was far less than the cheapest comparable model from Samsung. Today, Samsung is answering that challenge with an impressively low-priced 98-inch model of its own: the , which will be available starting in July for $8,000.
