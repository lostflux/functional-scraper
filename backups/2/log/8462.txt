Packed with a bevy of Samsung technology — including an exceptionally smart fridge and something called an “air dresser,” this home pairs outdoor entertainment with intelligent appliances. But first, let’s go over some of the highlights.

It has near-invisible floor-to-ceiling glass walls that seamlessly blend the indoors and outdoors, giving the space a very airy and open feel. Rather than standing out, the house is generally designed to get out of the way of its inhabitants, and keep everyday tasks from getting in the way. To achieve that, the house’s myriad Samsung smart appliances are designed to learn the owner’s preferences and take care of little tasks autonomously.

Each appliance communicates with the rest of the kitchen, and can be controlled from afar via voice or smartphone controls, or even from other appliances. For example, the range can steam, broil, or bake — and you can monitor and manage it all from a smart display on the fridge.
The kitchen isn’t the only smart room, though. Head to the bedroom and you’ll find an Aquadom Smart Mirror and Samsung Bespoke Air Dresser. The mirror can display news, weather, and traffic updates while you get situated for the day, while the closet will make sure your clothes are wrinkle-free and looking their best.

The house also boasts a number of wall-length murals, an in-ground infinity pool, high-gloss marble and polished concrete designs, and a free-floating tub that’ll make you drool. So get your tropical afterparty outfits ready and let’s dive into this episode!

These deals also coincide with a brand new release from the brand, with the debut of the BLUETTI AC200L portable solar generator and power station. It features a 2400-watt output, 2,048-watt-hour capacity, and a 1,200-watt solar input for speedy charging. It's a sleek newcomer that can be boosted to 3,600 watts in a PowerLifting mode for your extensive yet adaptable energy needs. More on that new station and the great deals below.
For a limited time, from November 17 until November 30, Digital Trends readers can use the coupon code DT100 at checkout to receive an extra $20 off. Yes, that code stacks with existing Black Friday deals.
Deals Vacuums are expensive. Feature-rich vacuums, especially wet-dry vacuums that can handle all spills, are even pricier. Recognizing that there’s a gap in the market for more affordable options, Eureka has delivered one for under $200. Get excited. They're perfect for cleaning sticky messes, whether you made them, your kids, or your pets. But the most important distinction is that wet and dry vacuums can vacuum and mop all in one go, and you don't have to swap out devices, attachments, or anything else. At least, that's the case with Eureka's excellent NEW400 wet and dry all-in-one vacuum. It's even self-propelled to make it easier on you -- and it takes less effort to glide around your floors.
Here's the best part of all, though. For Black Friday, running from November 17 to November 27, you can save big on the Eureka NEW400, which is discounted to $140 instead of its normal $200 price. That's a total savings of $60, but really, even more, considering you're not having to buy a separate vacuum and mop. You can grab that deal below right now or keep reading to learn a little more about what the NEW400 has to offer.
