Taking part in online play can provide you with multiple types of currencies that can be donated at shrines for some useful rewards. If you like co-op, we’ll tell you how it can earn you some Pilfered Coins and where you can donate them to get some fresh items and armor tincts.
How to get Pilfered Coins Where to donate Pilfered Coins How to get Pilfered Coins Pilfered Coins are obtained by engaging in co-op with other players. This can be done by visiting a vestige and either joining another player or having them join you for seamless online play. Every time you slay a boss of any type, you’ll gain some Pilfered Coins, which you’ll then need to take to the Shrine of Orius.
Where to donate Pilfered Coins CI Games You can donate your Pilfered Coins to the Shrine of Orius back in Skyrest. While facing the vestige here, go left just a little bit and through the door near a Stomund, Captain of the Fidelis. Down the stairs here and next to Nathaniel, you’ll find the Shrine of Orius.

But if you're also looking to earn every trophy the game has to offer to earn the coveted Platinum, you've probably noticed a bronze trophy called "Home Run!" that asks you to run the bases at Big Apple Ballers Stadium. You don't have to hit a homer to score this trophy, but you do need to take a lap around the bases, so we'll tell you where to find Big Apple Ballers Stadium below so you can start living out your baseball legend dreams.
Where to find Big Apple Ballers Stadium Big Apple Ballers Stadium is located in Downtown Brooklyn, which can be found at the very bottom of the southeast portion of the map. While it's a little difficult to make out the stadium on the map, you'll definitely be able to recognize it in-game as you swing closer, as it's quite a large stadium located not too far from the amusement park you visit as part of the story.
Of course, finding the stadium is only part of the equation for getting the Home Run! trophy. Once you reach the stadium, make your way to home plate and then run the bases in a counter-clockwise fashion (home, first, second, third, home) as if you'd just hit a home run.
Gaming In the decades that the character of Spider-Man has existed, through comics, TV shows, games, and movies, he's gone through quite a few suits. Spider-Man 2 keeps the tradition alive by not only giving him a new suit to try out, but dozens and dozens of older ones to let you play as your favorite version of the webslinger. Oh, and did we mention Miles has his own extensive set of suits as well? Just like the first game, you won't be handed the keys to the wardrobe for free. Each suit not only needs to be unlocked but also crafted using City and Hero Tokens, as well as Tech parts to get access to the additional styles most suits have. If you're itching to dress up as the Spider-Man of your dreams as soon as you can, here is every suit in Spider-Man 2 and how you unlock them.
Note: Some suits are unlocked via story progress and could be considered spoilers. You have been warned.
All suits in Spider-Man 2 Gaming Is there any doubt that Peter Parker and Miles Morales are heroes by the time Spider-Man 2 takes place? As goofy as it sounds, you will still need to prove your hero status by earning what are known as Hero Tokens. Just like City Tokens, these are more conceptual objects than actual tokens, but are still required for some of the higher-level upgrades and unlocks for your tools in the game. Still, not every heroic action is deemed worthy of getting you Hero Tokens. If you want to know all the activities to collect as many as you can in Spider-Man 2, we've narrowed down your search.
How to get Hero Tokens There are plenty of options for you to get Hero Tokens, but the most efficient are the Mysteriums. Also known as Mysterium dev diaries, these unlock after you meet Mysterio in the story and then they start to populate the map. There are only 10 of these, and they each consist of time trials that rank you based on time. Earning a gold will get you two Hero Tokens, while silver and bronze award you just one. So long as you're a skilled player and can get a gold time in one or two attempts, this is easily the fastest method to get these tokens. For one, you obviously have to go fast here, but when you get a gold, you also get the rewards for the two ranks below, so each Mysterium is really worth four tokens if you can master it.
