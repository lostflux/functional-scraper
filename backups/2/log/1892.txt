 This trope seems to imply that we can never state that A causes B by analysis of data alone. This talk will take a deeper look at if this is always the case by introducing the field of causal inference, with a special focus on (graphical) causal modelling. Attendees will leave having gained knowledge of how assumptions and data come together to enable drawing causal conclusions from data. More importantly, they will develop the basic intuition and fundamental concepts of causal modelling in the context of machine learning.
Other Few-shot Meta Learning Amphi wood 2 al-khawarizmi Jonathan Schwarz Despite groundbreaking successes of Machine Learning in the past decade, many practical problems remain outside the reach of modern approaches due to the absence of large datasets. This poses a major challenge in numerous settings such as medical applications, robotics, low-resource languages and others. In this session, we will explore recent work on Meta- & Few-shot learning algorithms, which are explicitly trained for fast adaptation to small datasets. The objective of this session is to motivate the research area, introduce the fundamental building blocks of modern algorithms and provide you with a set of methods that have established themselves over the years. In addition, we will discuss open problems and challenges in the area and provide you with pointers for additional reading.
Other Array Algebra Amphi Bleu Averroès Taliesin Beynon Array algebra refers to the operations that we can perform on rectangular arrays (“tensors”) of numbers, which are the fundamental data structures used in deep learning, as well as more generally in data science and data-oriented programming. This talk, which pairs with the array algebra practical, will give a whirlwind tour of what arrays are, and help to organize the operations we typically perform on them. We’ll look at the natural sequence of n-arrays where scalars / numbers = 0-arrays, vectors / tuples = 1-arrays, matrices = 2-arrays, etc. We’ll review some concrete examples of different n-arrays, and what the axes of these arrays mean.
 We’ll triangulate among several different viewpoints of n-arrays, to gain a better intuition of the core array operations: generalized dot products, aggregation, reshaping, transposing, slicing, stacking, mapping, etc. We’ll also try to equip you with helpful ways of thinking about higher-order arrays and their axes, one of the more challenging aspects of coding with complex neural network architectures.
Other Monte Carlo 101 Amphi wood 1 Ibn El Haythem Steven James Many problems in machine learning require us to compute the sum or integral of a distribution. Examples of this include calculating the expected value of a random variable or computing the normalising factor in Bayes’ theorem. While there are certain cases where an analytic solution can be computed, most often an exact solution is intractable and so must be approximated. In this talk, we cover Monte Carlo methods, where samples drawn from distribution can be used to numerically approximate the quantity of interest. We describe rejection and importance sampling, which can be used even when the target distribution is not easy to sample from. However, these approaches do not work well when applied to huge models or datasets, as is commonly the case in machine learning. We, therefore, conclude with Markov Chain Monte Carlo – an algorithm that can be used to efficiently sample from high-dimensional distributions.

Compared to the more common loss minimisation approach to learning, Bayesian methods offer us calibrated uncertainty estimates, resistance to overfitting, and even approaches to select hyper-parameters without a validation set. However, seemingly more involved mathematics and larger computational cost make Bayesian methods niche within the machine learning community.
In this talk, we will explore the foundations of Bayesian inference. We will start by discussing how Bayesian inference is inherent to human learning and reasoning. We will then codify this intuition by delving into how a Bayesian model is constructed. Finally, we will discuss practical algorithms for Bayesian machine learning and applications.
Other Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Amphi wood 2 al-khawarizmi Arnu Pretorious In this talk, we will introduce the basic concepts of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) and motivate why MARL is a useful approach to building large-scale decision-making AI systems. In particular, we will focus on value-based methods, from simple independent learning strategies to more advanced value-decomposition methods. This will showcase one line of research attempting to solve key multi-agent challenges. Finally, we will briefly discuss other efforts at the forefront of research and provide resources for those interested in pursuing the topic further.
Other Introduction to Transformers Amphi Bleu Averroès Ruan van der Merwe The transformer architecture introduced in 2017 has significantly impacted the deep learning field. This tutorial will cover the transformer in great detail so that you can: Explain it to your CEO Train a fellow machine learning engineer Maintain a conversation with a seasoned transformer researcher We will also demonstrate how to test if they suit your problem quickly and, if they do, how to structure your problem and data to get them working.
Other TIme Series Models Amphi wood 1 Ibn El Haythem Samaneh Kouchaki Ever-increasing qualities and quantities of data are routinely collected concerning all aspects of our life. Developments in wearable sensors, smart home technologies, and the Internet of Things provide the industry with opportunities to improve its services. However, analysing time-series data collected in different applications poses several challenges as the data can have substantial artefacts, might be incomplete, and contain high variations. This tutorial will introduce several machine learning techniques to tackle these issues and provide robust solutions to address such challenges. Various real-world examples especially on dealing with time series data in healthcare settings will also be provided.
