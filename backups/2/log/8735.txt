That information can help with Wi-Fi connections. Whether you have an HP, Epson, Canon, or Brother printer, we'll show you how to find the IP address and WPS PIN so you can solve any wireless network issues.
How to find your printer's IP address on Windows How to find your printer's IP address on a Mac Find your printer's IP address from the mobile app Find the IP address on your printer's display How to find your printer's WPS PIN Troubleshooting WPS dangers That information might be buried deep within menu settings, even when you buy the best printers.
Difficulty Duration An IP address is a group of four numbers separated by periods that allows wireless access to your printer's settings and information via a web browser. A WPS PIN (Wi-Fi Protected Setup) is an eight-digit number that lets you connect your printer to the Wi-Fi network without a password.
There's more than one way to find your printer's network details, and the methods vary even with printers from the same manufacturer. We'll cover the best places to check and what to look for to find the information you need.
How to find your printer's IP address on Windows It's easy to get the IP address of your printer on a Windows PC if you know where to look. The information is buried deep within Settings.
Step 1: Press the Windows-I key combination to open Settings.
 Select the Bluetooth & devices tab, then Printers & scanners.
Digital Trends Step 2: Select Device information in the More information section to reveal details about that printer. Look at the clickable link labeled Webpage.
 If you see something that looks like an IP number, write that group of numbers down. For example, "192.168.2.175" is an IP address. It's common for a printer IP address to start with "192.168.2", but sometimes it's different.

Digital Trends Find the IP address on your printer's display You can find the IP address within network settings in your printer's menu system. Sometimes, navigating on a small screen is awkward, but you can locate this data with patience and determination.
Step 1: Page through the options in your printer's menu system. Look for options like Network , Connectivity , Wireless , Web services , Wi-Fi , or WLAN section.

Digital Trends How to find your printer's WPS PIN The WPS PIN to connect your printer is usually in the same settings section as the IP address. See the section above about locating the IP address on your printer's display. The same tips will help you find the WPS PIN.
Digital Trends Troubleshooting If you can't find your printer's IP address or WPS PIN, double-check that you have a wireless printer. You can look in the manual or search the internet using the model number. Some printers require a direct Ethernet or USB cable connection to a computer or router.
Even if your printer has Wi-Fi connectivity, it might not support WPS. Some printers have a WPS button. Check the manual or try an internet search to find out the specific wireless features of your printer.
Our printer troubleshooting guide might help you resolve the problem.
WPS dangers Contrary to the name, Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) is less secure than the standard password-protected Wi-Fi. An eight-digit PIN is much easier for hackers to crack than Wi-Fi passwords, which can be longer and use letters, numbers, and symbols.
If you have the option of connecting via Wi-Fi, use that instead of WPS. Security experts recommend disabling WPS on your router if you don't need it.
With your IP address, you can access printer settings in a web browser, check ink or toner levels, and update firmware.
WPS has less value and is a bit of a relic of older Wi-Fi technology. It can be more convenient than passwords if your printer has a WPS button to simplify connecting. However, using a phone and the printer's mobile app is usually even simpler. WPS PINs aren't secure, and it's best to avoid using this connection method if possible.
If you still have trouble finding the network information you need after reading this guide, reach out to your printer manufacturer for help.

If itâ€™s time for a quick update to your old Wi-Fi password, our guide will show you just how to do it.
Computing If your current Wi-Fi connection isnâ€™t strong enough to support your growing number of devices, you might be on the lookout for a better solution. Perhaps youâ€™re experiencing frequent connection errors, slowdowns, and other technical difficulties. Wi-Fi 6 can offer a faster, more reliable connection.
Weâ€™ll talk more about this next-generation standard in Wi-Fi technology, tell you what it has to offer, and give you tips on determining what devices are compatible with Wi-Fi 6.
The dawn of generational Wi-Fi labels The Wi-Fi Alliance is the organization in charge of deciding, developing, and designating Wi-Fi standards. As devices become more complex and internet connections evolve, the process of delivering wireless connections also changes. That means that Wi-Fi standards -- the technical specifications that manufacturers use to create Wi-Fi -- need to be periodically updated so that new technology can flourish and everything can remain compatible. So far, so good.
Computing Whatever you need to print, thereâ€™s a home printer that can do it. But knowing how to choose a printer isn't always easy, given the sheer number of options on the market. To help, weâ€™ve put together a quick-and-dirty buying guide for selecting a home printer, with simple explanations of some of the most common terms, plus recommendations that will serve the majority of buyers.
Inkjet or laser? The first question all printer buyers must tackle comes down to a simple matter of what and how much you plan on printing. Inkjet printers use cartridges of ink that are applied wet to paper and rapidly dry, while laser printers use toner, a type of ink dust that bonds to paper for fast results and efficient resource use.
